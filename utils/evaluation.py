# Note: This script assumes that the summaries are stored in a specific format.
# Adjust the regex and logic as needed based on your actual summary format.
# The script reads the dataset, checks each summary for the presence of the answer,
# and counts how many answers are covered by the summaries.
# The output is the hit-rate of answers covered by the summaries.
# This script is useful for evaluating the performance of a model on the TAT-QA dataset
# in terms of how well it captures the answers in its summaries.
