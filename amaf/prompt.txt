 the above is a submission file for tatqa benchmarking. Now i want the same format to be followed from tabusynth to summacraft.
 since it requires question id also you need to change the proprocessor to add qid also , so basically make the data type of questions
 to dictionary .

 Also in case the answers are not coming from table then it should provide evidence as then the contexton agent will use it to combine with its
 own context to answer the question, check for questions like the region one where clearly
 we are seeing that the regions dicussed as Ireland and England but still summacraft is giving wrong answer.

 please review all this plan and then suggest changes
