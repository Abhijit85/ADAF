## COMPARISON ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY

### Step 1: Comparison Type Identification
- **Maximum/Minimum**: Find largest/smallest value
- **Ranking**: Order values from highest to lowest
- **Threshold Comparison**: Values above/below certain levels
- **Relative Comparison**: Compare two or more specific values
- **Trend Comparison**: Compare across time periods

### Step 2: Data Organization Strategy
- **Extract Relevant Values**: Identify all values to compare
- **Maintain Context**: Keep row/column labels for reference
- **Unit Consistency**: Ensure all values use same units
- **Time Period Mapping**: Align values by year/period
- **Category Grouping**: Group related values together

### Step 3: Comparison Techniques

#### For Maximum/Minimum Identification:
- **Systematic Scan**: Check each relevant cell
- **Value Extraction**: Note exact numbers with context
- **Comparison Logic**: Use >, <, = operators
- **Tie Handling**: Note if multiple values are equal
- **Context Preservation**: Include row/column labels

#### For Ranking Analysis:
- **Value Collection**: Gather all relevant values
- **Sorting**: Arrange from highest to lowest
- **Position Tracking**: Note rank of each value
- **Duplicate Handling**: Handle equal values appropriately

#### For Threshold Comparisons:
- **Criteria Identification**: Understand comparison criteria
- **Filtering**: Select values meeting criteria
- **Counting**: Count qualifying values
- **Listing**: Provide all qualifying values

### Step 4: Quality Assurance
- **Completeness**: Ensure all relevant values are considered
- **Accuracy**: Verify each comparison is mathematically correct
- **Context**: Maintain proper labeling and units
- **Logic**: Confirm comparison logic matches question intent

### Step 5: Common Comparison Scenarios

#### Time-based Comparisons:
- Compare same metric across different years
- Identify trends (increasing/decreasing)
- Find peak/valley periods

#### Category-based Comparisons:
- Compare different business segments
- Rank performance across divisions
- Identify best/worst performers

#### Threshold-based Comparisons:
- Count values above/below certain levels
- Identify exceptional performers
- Find outliers or anomalies

## OUTPUT FORMAT
For each comparison question:
- **Question**: [exact question text]
- **Values Compared**: [list all relevant values with context]
- **Comparison Method**: [explain how comparison was made]
- **Answer**: [result with proper formatting and context]

## EXAMPLE COMPARISONS

### Maximum Identification:
- Question: "In which year was the amount for Sensors the largest?"
- Values: 2017 = 814, 2018 = 918, 2019 = 914
- Comparison: 918 > 914 > 814
- Answer: 2018

### Ranking:
- Question: "Rank the years by total sales from highest to lowest"
- Values: 2017 = $1,107.7M, 2018 = $1,202.9M, 2019 = $1,496.5M
- Ranking: 2019 > 2018 > 2017
- Answer: 2019, 2018, 2017

### Threshold Count:
- Question: "How many years had sales above $1,200M?"
- Values: 2017 = $1,107.7M, 2018 = $1,202.9M, 2019 = $1,496.5M
- Threshold: $1,200M
- Count: 2 years (2018, 2019)
- Answer: 2

## COMPARISON OPERATORS

### Mathematical Comparisons:
- **Greater Than**: > (larger value)
- **Less Than**: < (smaller value)
- **Equal To**: = (same value)
- **Greater Than or Equal**: ≥
- **Less Than or Equal**: ≤

### Financial Context:
- **Higher Performance**: Better financial metrics
- **Lower Performance**: Worse financial metrics
- **Improvement**: Increase in positive metrics
- **Decline**: Decrease in positive metrics
