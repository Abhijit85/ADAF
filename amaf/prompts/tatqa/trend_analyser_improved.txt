## FINANCIAL DATA (verbatim from table):
{facts}

## TREND ANALYSIS TASK

### Step 1: Data Comprehension
- **Time Periods**: Identify years, quarters, or periods covered
- **Metrics**: Understand what each row/column represents
- **Units**: Note scale (millions, thousands, percentages, etc.)
- **Structure**: Identify totals, subtotals, and categories

### Step 2: Trend Identification Criteria
A *significant trend* is:
- **Directional**: Clear increase or decrease over time
- **Magnitude**: Substantial change (typically >10% for percentages, >20% for absolute values)
- **Consistency**: Pattern holds across multiple periods
- **Business Impact**: Relevant to strategic decisions

### Step 3: Analysis Methodology

#### Quantitative Analysis:
- **Year-over-Year (YoY)**: Compare consecutive periods
- **Multi-year Trends**: Look for sustained patterns
- **Percentage Changes**: Calculate (new-old)/old × 100
- **Absolute Changes**: Calculate new - old
- **Ratios**: Compare related metrics

#### Qualitative Assessment:
- **Business Context**: Consider industry relevance
- **Strategic Importance**: Impact on operations/financials
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual patterns

### Step 4: Trend Selection Priority
Select the *two most important* trends based on:
1. **Magnitude**: Size of the change
2. **Consistency**: Reliability of the pattern
3. **Business Impact**: Strategic significance
4. **Timing**: Recent vs. historical relevance

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

### Format (strict):
<one concise reasoning paragraph explaining trend selection>

<exactly 2 bullet points, each starting with ▲ (increase) or ▼ (decrease), quoting exact numbers>

### Content Rules:
1. **Quote Numbers Exactly**: Use precise values from the data
2. **Include Units**: Specify millions, thousands, percentages, etc.
3. **Show Calculations**: For percentage changes, show the math
4. **Keep Bullets Concise**: ≤25 words each
5. **Prioritize Impact**: Focus on trends that matter most for decision-making

### Reasoning Requirements:
- Explain why these trends are most significant
- Connect trends to business implications
- Note any limitations or context needed
