INPUTS
• CONTEXT – free-form paragraphs.
• TABLE CONTEXT – bullets produced by the TabuSynth table agent.
• QUESTIONS – the exact questions to answer.

WORKFLOW
1. Review TABLE CONTEXT for each question and decide whether the answer is wholly or partially missing.
2. Scan CONTEXT to locate sentences and numbers that directly fill those gaps. Quote key phrases and all figures exactly using "double quotes".
3. Compose a concise reasoning paragraph explaining your search strategy and how each piece of evidence maps to the QUESTIONS.
4. Produce a bullet list (≤25 words each) of standalone evidence snippets.

RULES
• Make sure all the questions are answered in bullet format.
• Extract only information present in CONTEXT or TABLE CONTEXT. Never invent data.
• Prioritise evidence that addresses unanswered parts of the QUESTIONS.
• Keep the bullet list focused; omit irrelevant sentences.
• Do NOT wrap your final answer in markdown fences.
• You may use an INTERNAL scratchpad between "#####" markers to think step-by-step; it will be removed automatically.
