## MATHEMATICAL COMPUTATION GUIDELINES

### Step 1: Operation Identification
- **Addition/Subtraction**: Sum or difference of values
- **Multiplication/Division**: Ratios, percentages, averages
- **Percentage Change**: (new - old) / old × 100
- **Compound Operations**: Multi-step calculations
- **Unit Conversions**: Handle different scales (millions, thousands, etc.)

### Step 2: Data Extraction Precision
- **Exact Values**: Extract numbers exactly as shown
- **Unit Awareness**: Note currency, scale (millions, thousands)
- **Format Preservation**: Maintain decimal places, commas
- **Context Understanding**: Identify which values to use

### Step 3: Calculation Methodology

#### For Simple Arithmetic:
- Extract operands from table/text
- Perform operation: value1 ± value2 = result
- Maintain proper units throughout
- Round appropriately (2 decimal places for percentages)

#### For Percentage Calculations:
- Identify base value and change
- Formula: (new - old) / old × 100
- Handle negative percentages correctly
- Round to 2 decimal places

#### For Averages:
- Sum all values
- Divide by count of values
- Round to appropriate decimal places
- Include proper units

#### For Multi-step Calculations:
- Break into sequential steps
- Show intermediate results
- Maintain unit consistency
- Verify final result

### Step 4: Quality Assurance
- **Double-check**: Verify all extractions are correct
- **Unit Verification**: Ensure units are consistent
- **Mathematical Accuracy**: Confirm calculations are correct
- **Format Compliance**: Match expected output format

### Step 5: Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Unit Mismatch**: Mixing millions and thousands
- **Sign Errors**: Incorrect positive/negative values
- **Rounding Errors**: Premature rounding in multi-step calculations
- **Context Confusion**: Using wrong values for calculation

- **Answer**: [final result with proper formatting and units]

## EXAMPLE CALCULATIONS

### Percentage Change:
- Values: 2019 = $1,496.5M, 2018 = $1,202.9M
- Calculation: (1496.5 - 1202.9) / 1202.9 × 100
- Result: 24.42%

### Simple Subtraction:
- Values: 2019 = 44.1, 2018 = 56.7
- Calculation: 44.1 - 56.7
- Result: -12.6

### Average:
- Values: 2017 = 1,107.7, 2018 = 1,202.9, 2019 = 1,496.5
- Calculation: (1107.7 + 1202.9 + 1496.5) / 3
- Result: 1268.7

## COMMON FINANCIAL CALCULATIONS

### Percentage Increase/Decrease:
- Formula: (new - old) / old × 100
- Example: Sales increased from $1,200M to $1,500M
- Calculation: (1500 - 1200) / 1200 × 100 = 25.0%

### Basis Points (bps):
- 1 bps = 0.01%
- Example: 148 bps decline = 1.48% decline

### Average Calculations:
- Simple Average: Sum of values / count
- Weighted Average: (value1 × weight1 + value2 × weight2) / total weight
