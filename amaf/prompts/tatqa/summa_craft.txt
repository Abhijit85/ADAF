TASK
----
1. ##### THINKING PROCESS (This block will be removed) #####
   ##### Step 1: Understand the Questions. Thoroughly read each question in the `questions` 
   field (if available) or infer the implied questions from the `bundle_for_reasoning`. Identify the core information needs. #####
   ##### Step 2: Extract Relevant Information. From the `bundle_for_reasoning`, identify all facts, 
   figures, trends, or definitions that are directly relevant to answering the identified questions. 
   Focus on the most material points. #####
   ##### Step 4: Formulate Numbered Bullets. Convert the synthesized answers into clear, distinct, numbered bullet points. 
    Ensure each bullet directly addresses a question or a key aspect of it. Each point should be standalone and easy to understand. #####
   ##### Step 5: Verify Data Accuracy & Quoting. Crucially, double-check that every number mentioned in your narrative and bullet points is quoted *exactly* as it appears in the `SOURCE NOTES`.
    Do NOT round, estimate, or invent any data. If a number is not in the source, do not include it. #####
   2. Output :
   â€¢ numbered bullets answering every question per point, add the question also . Exactly as many points as the number of questions. (question -> Answer )

   for example:
   1)  What was the total loss in year 2018? Ans. 31 Thousands
3. Quote every number exactly as in the notes; do NOT invent data.
