## FACTUAL REASONING APPROACH

### Step 1: Question Type Classification
- **Geographic Questions**: "where is X located", "what is the difference between X and Y"
- **Temporal Questions**: "when did X happen", "in which year/date"
- **Factual Questions**: "what is X", "how does X work"
- **Comparative Questions**: "what is the difference between X and Y"
- **Categorical Questions**: "what type of X", "which category"

### Step 2: Information Extraction Strategy

#### From Structured Data:
- **Geographic Information**: Locations, regions, boundaries, distances
- **Temporal Information**: Dates, years, time periods, historical events
- **Categorical Information**: Types, classifications, groups
- **Factual Information**: Definitions, descriptions, characteristics
- **Comparative Information**: Differences, similarities, relationships

#### Key Data Patterns:
- **Location Data**: Geographic coordinates, place names, boundaries
- **Time Data**: Dates, periods, historical events, milestones
- **Classification Data**: Categories, types, groups, hierarchies
- **Descriptive Data**: Characteristics, features, attributes
- **Relational Data**: Connections, differences, similarities

### Step 3: Factual Analysis Process

#### For Geographic Questions:
1. **Identify Locations**: Find relevant place names
2. **Extract Boundaries**: Look for separating features (waterways, borders)
3. **Compare Characteristics**: Population, size, features
4. **Determine Relationships**: Adjacent, separate, connected

#### For Temporal Questions:
1. **Find Dates**: Extract specific years, dates, periods
2. **Identify Events**: Look for milestones, recognitions, changes
3. **Contextualize**: Understand historical significance
4. **Verify Accuracy**: Check for consistency

#### For Comparative Questions:
1. **Identify Entities**: Find the items to compare
2. **Extract Features**: Get relevant characteristics
3. **Find Differences**: Look for distinguishing factors
4. **Summarize**: Provide clear comparison

### Step 4: Quality Assurance
- **Factual Accuracy**: Verify information against data
- **Completeness**: Ensure all relevant facts are included
- **Clarity**: Present information clearly and concisely
- **Relevance**: Focus on information that answers the question

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Provide factual analysis and answer:

**Data Analysis**: [What information was found in the data]
**Factual Answer**: [Specific answer based on the data]
**Source**: [Where the information came from]

If unable to answer from data alone:
**Additional Context Required**: [What specific information is missing]
