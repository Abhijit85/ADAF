## QUESTION TO ANSWER:
{questions}

## ARITHMETIC REASONING APPROACH

### Step 1: Question Type Classification
- **Ratio Questions**: "what is the ratio of X to Y"
- **Percentage Questions**: "what percentage of X is Y"
- **Difference Questions**: "what is the difference between X and Y"
- **Sum/Average Questions**: "what is the total/average of X"
- **Comparison Questions**: "which is larger/smaller"
- **Multi-step Questions**: Combinations of above

### Step 2: Systematic Calculation Process

#### For Ratio Calculations:
1. **Identify Components**: Find the two values to compare
2. **Extract Numbers**: Get exact values from table
3. **Calculate Ratio**: Value1 / Value2
4. **Format Result**: Express as decimal or fraction

#### For Percentage Calculations:
1. **Identify Base**: What the percentage is of
2. **Identify Part**: The portion to calculate
3. **Calculate**: (Part / Base) × 100
4. **Format**: Include % symbol

#### For Difference Calculations:
1. **Identify Values**: Find the two numbers
2. **Calculate**: Value1 - Value2
3. **Check Sign**: Positive or negative difference
4. **Format**: Include units and sign

### Step 3: Financial Data Extraction

#### Key Financial Metrics:
- **Employee Counts**: Pilots, flight attendants, total staff
- **Financial Figures**: Revenue, expenses, profits, assets
- **Ratios**: Efficiency ratios, financial ratios
- **Percentages**: Growth rates, composition percentages
- **Averages**: Mean values across categories

#### Common Calculation Patterns:
- **Staff Ratios**: Flight attendants / Pilots
- **Percentage of Total**: Category / Total × 100
- **Growth Rates**: (Current - Previous) / Previous × 100
- **Efficiency Metrics**: Output / Input ratios

### Step 4: Quality Assurance
- **Verify Numbers**: Double-check extracted values
- **Check Units**: Ensure consistent units
- **Validate Calculations**: Confirm mathematical accuracy
- **Format Properly**: Include decimals, percentages, ratios

**Answer**: [Final numerical result with proper formatting]

If unable to calculate from table data alone:
**Unable to answer solely from table, need additional context**

## EXAMPLE CALCULATIONS

### Ratio Example:
**Question**: "what is the ratio of flight attendants to pilots"
**Table Data**: Flight attendants = 24,800, Pilots = 15,400
**Calculation**: 24,800 / 15,400 = 1.61
**Answer**: 1.61

### Percentage Example:
**Question**: "what percentage of total employees are pilots"
**Table Data**: Pilots = 15,400, Total = 110,400
**Calculation**: (15,400 / 110,400) × 100 = 13.95%
**Answer**: 13.95%

### Difference Example:
**Question**: "what is the difference between American and US Airways pilots"
**Table Data**: American = 7,900, US Airways = 4,100
**Calculation**: 7,900 - 4,100 = 3,800
**Answer**: 3,800

## COMMON FINQA PATTERNS
- **Employee Ratios**: Staff category comparisons
- **Financial Ratios**: Revenue/expense relationships
- **Percentage Compositions**: Parts of whole
- **Growth Calculations**: Year-over-year changes
- **Efficiency Metrics**: Output per input ratios
