  "context": "as a result of our acquisition of third wave on july 24 , 2008 , we assumed certain operating leases , the most significant of which is related to their corporate facility in madison , wisconsin , which is effective through september 2014 . future lease payments on these operating leases were approximately $ 5.8 million as of september 27 , 2008 . additionally , we assumed several license agreements for certain patent rights . these payments will be made through 2011 and future payments under these license agreements are approximately $ 7.0 million as of september 27 , 2008 . contractual obligations . the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of september 27 , 2008: . ( 1 ) approximately $ 6.4 million of the purchase obligations relates to an exclusive distribution and service agreement in the united states under which we will sell and service a line of extremity mri systems . pursuant to the terms of this contract , we have certain minimum inventory purchase obligations for the initial term of eighteen months . thereafter the purchase obligations are subject to renegotiation in the event of any unforeseen changes in the market dynamics . ( 2 ) as a result of the merger with cytyc , we assumed on a consolidated basis certain non-cancelable supply contracts . for reasons of quality assurance , sole source availability or cost effectiveness , certain key components and raw materials are available only from a sole supplier . to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability , long-term supply contracts have been executed with these suppliers . in certain of these contracts , a minimum purchase commitment has been established .
