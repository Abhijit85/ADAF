  "context": "\"Because the Night\" is a song written by Bruce Springsteen with some of the words changed by Patti Smith that was first released in 1978 as a single off the Patti Smith Group album Easter. It rose to number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, as well as number five in the United Kingdom, and helped propel sales of Easter to mainstream success\u2014even as Smith was deciding to retire from a life of constant touring. In 1987, the song was ranked number 116 on NME magazine's list of \"The Top 150 Singles of All Time\". It remains one of the best-known songs of Smith's catalog.\n\nGet Your Phil is the sixth studio album released by Disappear Fear. This release marks the return of the harmonizing vocals of sisters: Sonia Rutstein (SONiA) and Cindy Frank (CiNDY); which have not been featured since the group's 1996 album, Seed in the Sahara. The album has been described as, \"100% made in America, folk music.\" All tracks are songs written by Phil Ochs, except for \"Because the Night\" which was penned by Patti Smith and Bruce Springsteen. The album was released on July 4, 2011. Cindy said of the release date, \"We think a new anti-war album released on Independence Day is a great idea and we hope that Phil would be proud.\" The majority of the instrumentation on the album is done by Sonia. She plays the acoustic guitar, piano and harmonica. The album was engineered and produced by Grammy nominee, John Jacob.",
