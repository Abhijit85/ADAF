  "context": "Eugen Berthold Friedrich \"Bertolt\" Brecht (/br\u025bxt/; German: [b\u0280\u025b\u00e7t]; 10 February 1898\u00a0\u2013 14 August 1956) was a German poet, playwright, and theatre director of the 20th century. He made contributions to dramaturgy and theatrical production, the latter through the tours undertaken by the Berliner Ensemble\u00a0\u2013 the post-war theatre company operated by Brecht and his wife, long-time collaborator and actress Helene Weigel.\n\nWilliam John Banville (born 8 December 1945), who writes as John Banville and sometimes as Benjamin Black, is an Irish novelist, adapter of dramas, and screenwriter. Recognised for his precise, cold, forensic prose style, Nabokovian inventiveness, and for the dark humour of his generally arch narrators, Banville is considered to be \"one of the most imaginative literary novelists writing in the English language today.\" He has been described as \"the heir to Proust, via Nabokov.\"",
