  "context": "Transparent is a 2005 documentary film written, directed, and produced by Jules Rosskam. Its title is a play on the words \u201ctrans\u201d and \u201cparent\u201d implying the invisibility of transgender parenting in society today. The documentary follows 19 female-to-male transsexuals from 14 different states who have given birth to, and in most cases, gone on to raise, their biological children and the challenges they face while transitioning.\n\nStolen Honor is a 45-minute anti-John Kerry video documentary that was released during the September 2004 election season. It features interviews with a number of American men who contend they were prisoners of war in North Vietnam and suffered increased maltreatment while prisoners as a direct result of Kerry's Fulbright Hearing testimony in April 1971.  The subtitle of the film is Wounds That Never Heal; on the production company's website the complete title is given instead as Stolen Honor: John Kerry's Record of Betrayal. Its name was based on the book Stolen Valor: How the Vietnam Generation Was Robbed of Its Heroes and Its History by B.G. Burkett and Glenna Whitley.[citation needed]",
