  "context": "The Berlin Historic District encompasses the ghost town of Berlin in Nye County, Nevada. The town was established in 1897 as part of the Union Mining District after the opening of the Berlin Mine the previous year. The town never prospered to the same extent as other boom towns like Tonopah and Goldfield, and declined following the Panic of 1907. The town was largely abandoned by 1911. The site was acquired by the state of Nevada as part of Berlin\u2013Ichthyosaur State Park in 1970.\n\nBerlin\u2013Ichthyosaur State Park is a public recreation area and historic preserve that protects undisturbed ichthyosaur fossils and the ghost town of Berlin in far northwestern Nye County, Nevada. The state park covers more than 1,100 acres (450\u00a0ha) at an elevation of 7,000 feet (2,100\u00a0m) on the western slope of central Nevada's Shoshone mountain range, 23 miles (37\u00a0km) east of Gabbs.",
