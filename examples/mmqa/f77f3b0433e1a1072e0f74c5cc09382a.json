  "context": "\"Here Comes the Sun\" is a song written by George Harrison that was first released on the Beatles' 1969 album Abbey Road. Along with \"Something\" and \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\", it is one of Harrison's best-known compositions from the Beatles era. The song was written at the country house of his friend Eric Clapton, where Harrison had chosen to play truant for the day, to avoid attending a meeting at the Beatles' Apple Corps organisation. The lyrics reflect the composer's relief at both the arrival of spring and the temporary respite he was experiencing from the band's business affairs.",
