While NBC did re-air the special twice following its initial airing, it has rarely been seen since. It was created by Bill Cosby and animator Ken Mundie (best known for the opening credit sequences of Rawhide and The Wild Wild West). It was based on Cosby's stand-up routines, which were based on his childhood. It would later inspire the long-running 1972 animated series Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids.\n\nFat Albert and the Cosby Kids is an American animated series created, produced, and hosted (in live action bookends) by comedian Bill Cosby, who also lent his voice to a number of characters, including Fat Albert himself. Filmation was the production company for the series. The show premiered in 1972 and ran until 1985 (with new episodes being produced sporadically  during that time frame).
