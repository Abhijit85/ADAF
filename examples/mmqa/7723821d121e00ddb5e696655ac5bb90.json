The family's impetus for moving there was to be closer to Dr. Milton, a neurologist hoping to treat James, who suffered an accident that has left him on life support. Upon moving in, Juliet tells Belle that James has been talking to her lately, \"using a lot of curse words.\" One night, James flatlines, but is mysteriously revived and opens his eyes.",
