  "context": "\"Love means never having to say you're sorry\" is a catchphrase based on a line from the Erich Segal novel Love Story and was popularized by its 1970 film adaptation starring Ali MacGraw and Ryan O'Neal. The line is spoken twice in the film: once in the middle of the film, by Jennifer Cavalleri (MacGraw's character), when Oliver Barrett (O'Neal) apologizes to her for his anger; and as the last line of the film, by Oliver, when his father says \"I'm sorry\" after learning of Jennifer's death. In the script the line is phrased slightly differently: \"Love means not ever having to say you're sorry.\"\n\n\"Love means never having to say you're sorry\" is a catchphrase based on a line from the Erich Segal novel Love Story and was popularized by its 1970 film adaptation starring Ali MacGraw and Ryan O'Neal.
