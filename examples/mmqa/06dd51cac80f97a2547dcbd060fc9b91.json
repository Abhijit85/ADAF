  "context": "A sphinx (Ancient Greek: \u03a3\u03c6\u03af\u03b3\u03be [sp\u02b0\u00ed\u014bks], Boeotian: \u03a6\u03af\u03be [p\u02b0\u00ed\u02d0ks], plural sphinxes or sphinges) is a mythical creature with the head of a human and the body of a lion.\n\nSphingolipids, or glycosylceramides, are a class of lipids containing a backbone of sphingoid bases, a set of aliphatic amino alcohols that includes sphingosine.  They were discovered in brain extracts in the 1870s and were named after the mythological Sphinx because of their enigmatic nature. These compounds play important roles in signal transmission and cell recognition. Sphingolipidoses, or disorders of sphingolipid metabolism, have particular impact on neural tissue. A sphingolipid with an R group consisting of a hydrogen atom only is a ceramide. Other common R groups include phosphocholine, yielding a sphingomyelin, and various sugar monomers or dimers, yielding cerebrosides and globosides, respectively. Cerebrosides and globosides are collectively known as glycosphingolipids.",
