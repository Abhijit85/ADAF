  "context": "The sperm from a mating is stored by the female and can suffice to fertilise about six eggs. The pair mate every day or two, and every second or third day the female lays one of a clutch of five to fifteen very large, thick-shelled, green eggs. The shell is around 1\u00a0mm (0.04\u00a0in) thick, but rather thinner in northern regions according to indigenous Australians. The eggs are on average 13\u00a0cm \u00d7\u00a09\u00a0cm (5.1\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a03.5\u00a0in) and weigh between 450 and 650\u00a0g (1.0 and 1.4\u00a0lb). The maternal investment in the egg is considerable, and the proportion of yolk to albumen, at about 50%, is greater than would be predicted for a precocial egg of this size. This probably relates to the long incubation period which means the developing chick must consume greater resources before hatching. The first verified occurrence of genetically identical avian twins was demonstrated in the emu. The egg surface is granulated and pale green. During the incubation period, the egg turns dark green, although if the egg never hatches, it will turn white from the bleaching effect of the sun.",
