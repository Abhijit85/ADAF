  "context": "John Adam Belushi (/b\u0259\u02c8lu\u02d0\u0283i/; January 24, 1949 \u2013 March 5, 1982) was an American comedian, actor and musician. Belushi is best known for his \"intense energy and raucous attitude\" which he displayed as one of the seven original cast members of the NBC sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live (SNL). Throughout his career, Belushi had a close personal and artistic partnership with his fellow SNL star Dan Aykroyd, whom he met while they were both working at Chicago's The Second City comedy club.\n\nIn the early years of Saturday Night Live, John Belushi portrayed an archetypal samurai \u2014 he had a dedicated concept of honor, spoke only (mock) Japanese, and wielded a katana. Sketches featuring the character showed him in different occupations that would not be expected for a samurai. He always performed his tasks perfectly, despite scaring his clients quite a few times. The character was modeled after Toshiro Mifune's character in Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo.",
