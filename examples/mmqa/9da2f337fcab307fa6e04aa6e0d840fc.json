  "context": "Although almost all penguin species are native to the Southern Hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of penguin actually live so far south. Several species live in the temperate zone; one, the Gal\u00e1pagos penguin, lives as far north as the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, but this is only made possible by the cold, rich waters of the Antarctic Humboldt Current that flows around these islands.",
