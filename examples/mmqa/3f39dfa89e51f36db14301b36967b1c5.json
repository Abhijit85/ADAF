Fitz outwardly claims that early criticism of Antony and Cleopatra is \"colored by the sexist assumptions the critics have brought with them to their reading.\":p.297 Fitz argues that previous criticisms place a heavy emphasis on Cleopatra's \"wicked and manipulative\" ways, which are further emphasised by her association with Egypt and her contrast to the \"chaste and submissive\" Roman Octavia.:p.301 Finally, Fitz emphasises the tendency of early critics to assert that Antony is the sole protagonist of the play. This claim is apparent in Brandes argument: \"when [Antony] perishes, a prey to the voluptuousness of the East, it seems as though Roman greatness and the Roman Republic expires with him.\" Yet Fitz points out that Antony dies in Act IV while Cleopatra (and therefore Egypt) is present throughout Act V until she commits suicide at the end and \"would seem to fulfill at least the formal requirements of the tragic hero.\":p.310",
