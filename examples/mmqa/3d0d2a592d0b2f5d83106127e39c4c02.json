  "context": "Manowar is an American heavy metal band from Auburn, New York. Formed in 1980, the group is known for lyrics based on fantasy (particularly sword and sorcery) and mythology  (particularly Norse mythology). The band is also known for a loud and bombastic sound. In an interview for MTV in February 2007, bassist Joey DeMaio lamented that \"these days, there's a real lack of big, epic metal that is drenched with crushing guitars and choirs and orchestras... so it's nice to be one of the few bands that's actually doing that.\" In 1984 the band was included in the Guinness Book of World Records for delivering the loudest performance, a record which they have since broken on 2 occasions. They also hold the world record for the longest heavy metal concert after playing for 5 hours and 1 minute in Bulgaria (at Kavarna Rock Fest) in 2008. They also have been known for their slogan \"Death to false metal\".\n\nMagic Circle Music was founded by Manowar bassist Joey DeMaio in 2005 named after Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen by which DeMaio is highly inspired. The purpose of the label is to give the band (Manowar) complete creative control of their operation. Furthermore, it is stated on their website that they (Manowar) saw many other bands \"fall to the perils of greed and commercialization in the music industry\". To that end DeMaio founded Magic Circle Music through which he felt he could help other developing artists avoid these traps.",
