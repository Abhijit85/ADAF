  "context": "Victoria \"Vicky\" Winters is a fictional character from the television Gothic soap opera Dark Shadows and its remakes of the same name. The role was originated by Alexandra Moltke on the ABC series from 1966 to 1968. After Moltke left to raise a family in 1968, actresses Betsy Durkin and Carolyn Groves briefly replaced her for only a handful of episodes, before Victoria was written out completely. Jaclyn Smith, who was married to Dark Shadows actor Roger Davis at the time, was offered the role when Moltke left the show, but she declined.\n\nJaclyn Ellen Smith (born October 26, 1945) is an American actress and businesswoman. She is known for her role as Kelly Garrett in the television series Charlie's Angels (1976\u201381), and was the only original female lead to remain with the series for its complete run.
