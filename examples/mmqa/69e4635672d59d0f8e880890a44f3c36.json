  "context": "North Carolina's climate varies from the Atlantic coast in the east to the Appalachian Mountain range in the west. The mountains often act as a \"shield\", blocking low temperatures and storms from the Midwest from entering the Piedmont of North Carolina. Most of the state has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfa), except in the higher elevations of the Appalachians which have a subtropical highland climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfb). For most areas in the state, the temperatures in July during the daytime are approximately 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C). In January the average temperatures range near 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C). (However, a polar vortex or \"cold blast\" can significantly bring down average temperatures, seen in the winters of 2014 and 2015.)",
