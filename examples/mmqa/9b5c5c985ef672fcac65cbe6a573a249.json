First published as a serial in The Dark Blue (1871\u201372), the story is narrated by a young woman preyed upon by a female vampire named Carmilla, later revealed to be Mircalla, Countess Karnstein (Carmilla is an anagram of Mircalla). The story is often anthologized and has been adapted many times in film and other media.\n\nJoseph Thomas Sheridan Le Fanu (/\u02c8l\u025bf\u0259nju\u02d0/; 28 August 1814\u00a0\u2013 7 February 1873) was an Irish writer of Gothic tales and mystery novels.
