The cast includes Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Robert Duvall, Randy Quaid, Cary Elwes, Caroline Williams, and Michael Rooker. The film also features appearances by real life NASCAR racers, such as Rusty Wallace, Neil Bonnett, and Harry Gant. Commentator Dr. Jerry Punch, of ESPN, has a cameo appearance, as does co-producer Don Simpson.\n\nTa Ra Rum Pum  is a 2007 Indian Hindi sports-drama film that stars Saif Ali Khan and Rani Mukerji in the lead roles. This is the second time the lead pair worked together after the success of their last film, Hum Tum (2004). It was directed by Siddharth Anand, who directed 2005's Salaam Namaste (Also starring Khan), and also wrote Hum Tum. A small amount of the plot can be compared loosely with that of Will Ferrell's Talladega Nights and Tony Scott's Days of Thunder. The film was a hit at the box office in India and was one of the highest grossing films of 2007. Ta Ra Rum Pum marks the final commercial success in a romance film of Rani Mukerji, who was the highest paid actress in Bollywood during the 2000s.",
