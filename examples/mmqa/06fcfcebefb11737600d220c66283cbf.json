  "context": "God and Other Minds is the title of a 1967 book by the American philosopher of religion Alvin Plantinga which re-kindled serious philosophical debate on the existence of God in Anglo-American philosophical circles by arguing that belief in God was like belief in other minds: although neither could be demonstrated conclusively against a determined sceptic both were fundamentally rational. Though Plantinga later modified some of his views, particularly on the soundness of the ontological argument and on the nature of epistemic rationality, he still stands by the basic theses of the book.\n\nAlvin Carl Plantinga (/\u02c8pl\u00e6nt\u026a\u014b\u0261\u0259/; born November 15, 1932) is an American analytic philosopher who works primarily in logic, justification, philosophy of religion, and epistemology. From 1963 to 1982, Plantinga taught at Calvin College before accepting an appointment as the John A. O'Brien Professor of Philosophy at the University of Notre Dame. He later returned to Calvin College to become the inaugural holder of the Jellema Chair in Philosophy.",
