He is the identical twin brother of Horace Grant, also a former NBA player.\n\nThe 1993\u201394 NBA season was the 24th season for the Portland Trail Blazers in the National Basketball Association.  In the offseason, the Blazers acquired Harvey Grant from the Washington Bullets and signed unrestricted free agent Chris Dudley. However, an ankle injury limited Dudley to just six games. The Blazers finished the season with a 47\u201335 record, fourth in the Pacific Division and seventh in the Western Conference. It was their 12th straight trip to the postseason. Clifford Robinson led the Blazers in scoring with 20.1 points per game, and was selected for the 1994 NBA All-Star Game along with Clyde Drexler.",
