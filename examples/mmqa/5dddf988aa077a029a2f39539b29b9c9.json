  "context": "Javier Garc\u00eda Portillo (born 30 March 1982 in Aranjuez, Community of Madrid) is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a forward.\n\nACF Fiorentina returned to Serie A, following a two-year absence after the bankruptcy of the previous incarnation of the club. Fiorentina returned only due to the expansion in terms of the number of top-league teams, and therefore had to significantly strengthen the squad in pre-season. Dario Dainelli, Giorgio Chiellini, Hidetoshi Nakata, Fabrizio Miccoli, Martin J\u00f8rgensen, goalkeeper Cristiano Lupatelli, Enzo Maresca, Tom\u00e1\u0161 Ujfalu\u0161i and Javier Portillo were among the highly rated players to sign up for Fiorentina, either permanently or on loan. With this squad, Fiorentina was expected to challenge for a place on the top half of the table, but slipped into the relegation battle that affected more than half of the Serie A clubs during the dramatic season. In the end, a strong finish to the season under incoming coach Dino Zoff saved La Viola from relegation, with an emotional 3\u20130 victory against Brescia confirming their survival.",
