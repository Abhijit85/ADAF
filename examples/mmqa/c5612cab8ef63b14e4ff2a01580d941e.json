  "context": "\"201\" is the sixth episode of the fourteenth season of South Park, and the 201st overall episode of the series. It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 21, 2010. The episode continued multiple storylines from the previous episode, \"200\", in which a group of angry celebrities demand South Park produce the Muslim prophet Muhammad. In \"201\", a superhero-like group of religious figures team up to save South Park from the celebrities and their monster Mecha-Streisand, while Eric Cartman learns the true identity of his father.\n\nEverybody Draw Mohammed Day (or \"Draw Mohammed Day\") was a 2010 event in support of artists threatened with violence for drawing representations of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. It stemmed from a protest against censorship of the American television show South Park episode \"201\", led by the show's distributor Comedy Central, in response to death threats that had been made against some of those responsible for two segments broadcast in April 2010. A drawing representing Mohammed was posted on the Internet on April 20, 2010 with a message suggesting that \"everybody\" create a drawing depicting Mohammad on May 20 in support of free speech.",
