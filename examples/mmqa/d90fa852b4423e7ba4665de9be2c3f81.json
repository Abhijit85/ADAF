  "context": "Interpretation of the Necessary and Proper Clause has been controversial, especially during the early years of the republic. Strict constructionists interpret the clause to mean that Congress may make a law only if the inability to do so would cripple its ability to apply one of its enumerated powers. Loose constructionists, on the other hand, believe it is largely up to Congress and not the courts to determine what means are \"necessary and proper\" to executing one of its enumerated powers. It is often known as the \"elastic clause\" because of the great amount of leeway in interpretation it allows; depending on the interpretation, it can be \"stretched\" to expand the powers of Congress, or allowed to \"contract\", limiting Congress. In practical usage, the clause has been paired with the Commerce Clause in particular to provide the constitutional basis for a wide variety of federal laws.",
