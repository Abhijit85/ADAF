This system was based on the ideas of Confucianism that spread to Japan from China. By this system, society was composed of samurai (\u4f8d shi), farming peasants (\u8fb2 n\u014d), artisans (\u5de5 k\u014d) and merchants (\u5546 sh\u014d). Samurai were placed at the top of society because they started an order and set a high moral example for others to follow.

According to Confucian philosophy, society could not survive without agriculture.:45 Third were artisans because they produced nonessential goods.\n\nThe Tokugawa government intentionally created a social order called the Four divisions of society (shin\u014dk\u014dsh\u014d), that would stabilize the country.
