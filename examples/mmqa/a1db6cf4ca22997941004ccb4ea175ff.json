Britney Spears, TLC, and NSYNC performed live from Orlando, Florida. About 6.2 million children participated in voting. Immediately following the awards was the series premiere of SpongeBob SquarePants, which remains Nickelodeon's longest running animated series.\n\nNSYNC (/\u02cc\u026an\u02c8s\u026ank/; sometimes stylized as *NSYNC or 'N Sync) was an American boy band formed in Orlando, Florida in 1995 and launched in Germany by BMG Ariola Munich. NSYNC consisted of Justin Timberlake, JC Chasez, Chris Kirkpatrick, Joey Fatone, and Lance Bass. After heavily publicized legal battles with their former manager Lou Pearlman and former record label Bertelsmann Music Group, the group's second album, No Strings Attached, sold over one million copies in one day and 2.42\u00a0million copies in one week, which was a record for over fifteen years. Among the group's singles, \"Bye Bye Bye\", \"This I Promise You\", \"Girlfriend\" and \"It's Gonna Be Me\" reached the top 10 in several national charts, with the latter being a US Billboard Hot 100 number one. In addition to a host of Grammy Award nominations, NSYNC has performed at the World Series, the Super Bowl and the Olympic Games, and sang or recorded with Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, Phil Collins, Celine Dion, Aerosmith, Nelly, Left Eye, Mary J. Blige, country music supergroup Alabama, and Gloria Estefan.",
