A liberty pole was installed nearby with a flag that could be raised above the tree to summon the townspeople to a meeting. Ebenezer Mackintosh, a shoemaker who handled much of the hands-on work of hanging effigies and leading angry mobs, became known as \"Captain General of the Liberty Tree.\" Paul Revere included the Liberty Tree in an engraving, \"A View of the Year 1765.\"",
