  "context": "The series' title music, \"Old Ned\", won its composer Ron Grainer his second successive Ivor Novello award. The series had no standard set of opening titles but the opening sequences would often feature the Steptoe's horse, Hercules. \"Steptoe and Son\" is the Steptoes' trading name, but as established in the first episode, the \"Son\" is not Harold as initially believed, but Albert. The name dates from when he and his mother\u2014Mrs. Steptoe\u2014worked the rounds. The first series has the pair as very rough looking and often dirty and wearing ragged clothes, but they quickly \"tidied up\" for later series.",
