  "context": "The Tenth Amendment is similar to an earlier provision of the Articles of Confederation: \"Each state retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence, and every power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not by this Confederation expressly delegated to the United States, in Congress assembled.\" After the Constitution was ratified, South Carolina Representative Thomas Tudor Tucker and Massachusetts Representative Elbridge Gerry separately proposed similar amendments limiting the federal government to powers \"expressly\" delegated, which would have denied implied powers. James Madison opposed the amendments, stating that \"it was impossible to confine a Government to the exercise of express powers; there must necessarily be admitted powers by implication, unless the Constitution descended to recount every minutia.\" When a vote on this version of the amendment with \"expressly delegated\" was defeated, Connecticut Representative Roger Sherman drafted the Tenth Amendment in its ratified form, omitting \"expressly.\" Sherman's language allowed for an expansive reading of the powers implied by the Necessary and Proper Clause.",
