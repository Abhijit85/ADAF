  "context": "Tobias Wilson (voiced by Rupert Degas, season 1; Hugo Harrison, season 2 onward) is a multicolored, cloud-shaped humanoid who is heavily interested in sports and possesses an overbearing self-confidence. He thinks of himself as a heavily built jock, despite actually being rather weak, and appears to be quite wealthy. He makes his debut appearance in \"The Third\", where Gumball and Darwin pay him twenty dollars to become their friend. In \"The Knights\", Tobias holds a mock medieval battle with Gumball for the affection of Penny. Despite this, he has been seen hanging out with Gumball and Darwin on several occasions, including having a starring role in one of the duo's home movies. He has an older sister, Rachel (voiced by Jessica McDonald), who considers herself of higher status than Tobias and his \"dweeb loser baby friends\".",
