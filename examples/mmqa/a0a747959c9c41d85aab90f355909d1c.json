  "context": "George Alfred Maran (July 25, 1926\u00a0\u2013 Nov 26, 2011) was an American opera, oratorio, and concert tenor.  Born near Boston, Massachusetts. Maran attended Harvard University where he and his voice came to the attention of people such as Leonard Bernstein and Paul Hindemith. He first drew international attention when he won the \u201cMozart-Medaille\u201d(Mozart Medal) from the Mozarteum International Foundation in Salzburg in 1956 on Mozart\u2019s 200th birthday. The same year, and the next forty years thereafter, he was a soloist at the Opera in Darmstadt, Germany. Even so, he continued singing all over Europe and the United States, the world premiere of A Midsummer Night's Dream (opera) with Benjamin Britten conducting as a prime example. He has sung many wide-ranging and varied genres as soloist in opera, operetta, oratorio, and on the concert stage.\n\nPaul Hindemith (English:  /\u02cc\u02c8h\u026and\u0259m\u026at/) (16 November 1895 \u2013 28 December 1963) was a prolific German composer, violist, violinist, teacher and conductor. Notable compositions include his song cycle Das Marienleben (1923), Der Schwanendreher for viola and orchestra (1935), and opera Mathis der Maler (1938). Hindemith's most popular work, both on record and in the concert hall, is likely the Symphonic Metamorphosis of Themes by Carl Maria von Weber, written in 1943.",
