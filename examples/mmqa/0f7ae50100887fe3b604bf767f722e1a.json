  "context": "Super League began in 1996, replacing the Rugby Football League Championship and switching from a winter to a summer season. Each team plays 29 games between February and September: 11 home games, 11 away games, Magic Weekend and an additional 6 'loop fixtures' decided by league positions. The top five then enter the play-off series leading to the Grand Final which determines the champions. The bottom team is relegated to the Championship.",
