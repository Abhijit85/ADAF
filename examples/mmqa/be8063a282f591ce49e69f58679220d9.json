It tells the story of a couple who, after the death of their child, retreat to a cabin in the woods where the man experiences strange visions and the woman manifests increasingly violent sexual behaviour and sadomasochism. The narrative is divided into a prologue, four chapters and an epilogue. The film was primarily a Danish production and co-produced by companies from six different European countries. It was filmed in Germany and Sweden.\n\nThe 63rd Bodil Awardss were held on 21 March 2010 in the Imperial Cinema in Copenhagen, Denmark, honouring the best national and foreign films of 2009.
