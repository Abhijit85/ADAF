Mexican General Jos\u00e9 de Urrea led a contingent of troops on the Goliad Campaign up the Texas coast, defeating all Texian troops in his path and executing most of those who surrendered. Santa Anna led a larger force to San Antonio de B\u00e9xar (or B\u00e9xar), where his troops defeated the Texian garrison in the Battle of the Alamo, killing almost all of the defenders.",
