  "context": "\"Make Your Own Kind of Music\" is a pop song written by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, first recorded in 1968 by the New York City-based trio the Will-O-Bees (Janet Blossom, Steven Porter, and Robert Merchanthouse), who regularly performed Mann/Weil compositions. After Cass Elliot had a hit in the summer of 1969 with Mann/Weil's \"It's Getting Better\", she recorded \"Make Your Own Kind of Music\" as the follow-up single, and her album Bubblegum, Lemonade, and... Something for Mama was re-released as \"Make Your Own Kind Of Music/It's Getting Better,\" the title cut having been added to the original track listing. However, Elliot's \"Make Your Own Kind of Music\" single only reached No. 36. The similar chart impact of the follow-up single, another Mann/Weil composition entitled \"New World Coming,\" which reached No. 42, signaled Elliot's challenges in maintaining a profile as a current hitmaker, as the 1960s turned into the 1970s. The Cass Elliot track is in the key of E major.",
