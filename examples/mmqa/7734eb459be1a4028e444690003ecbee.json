  "context": "Alex (born Alakay) is a male African lion. Alex is headstrong, protective and self-proclaimed leader of his friends. He is best friends with Marty the zebra (Chris Rock). He is used to the life of comfort in the zoo, but learns to adapt to the wild. He's smart, quick thinking and fast on his feet. He is a dancer by nature, often impressing others with his aerobatic feats. He does tend to be a little self-absorbed, often not seeing the problems of others above his own.",
