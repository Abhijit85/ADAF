  "context": "Spielberg acquired rights to produce a film based on The Adventures of Tintin series following Herg\u00e9's death in 1983, and re-optioned them in 2002. Filming was due to begin in October 2008 for a 2010 release, but release was delayed to 2011 after Universal opted out of producing the film with Paramount, who provided $30 million on pre-production. Sony chose to co-produce the film. The delay resulted in Thomas Sangster, who had been originally cast as Tintin, departing from the project. Producer Peter Jackson, whose company Weta Digital provided the computer animation, intends to direct a sequel. Spielberg and Jackson also hope to co-direct a third film. The world premi\u00e8re took place on 22 October 2011 in Brussels. The film was released in the United Kingdom and other European countries on 26 October 2011, and in the United States on 21 December 2011, in Digital 3D and IMAX.",
