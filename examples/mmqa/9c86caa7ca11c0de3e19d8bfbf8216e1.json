  "context": "Michael van Gerwen (Dutch pronunciation: [\u02c8m\u0251ik\u0259l v\u0251n \u02c8\u0263\u025br\u028b\u0259n]; born 25 April 1989) is a Dutch professional darts player. He is the reigning PDC World Champion and currently ranked world number one. He began playing darts at the age of 13 and had won the World Masters and thrown a televised nine-dart finish within four years, becoming the youngest player to do either. However, after this initial burst onto the darting scene, Van Gerwen struggled for consistent form until his breakthrough year in 2012. Going from world number 38 at the start of 2012 to number four at the beginning of 2013, the year included his first major PDC title at the Grand Prix and a final at the 2013 World Championship. In 2014, at the age of 24, Van Gerwen became the youngest winner of the PDC World Championship. \n\nThe 2012 Grand Slam of Darts, also known as the William Hill Grand Slam of Darts for sponsorship purposes, was the sixth staging of the tournament, organised by the Professional Darts Corporation. The event took place from 10\u201318 November 2012 at the Wolverhampton Civic Hall. Phil Taylor was the defending champion, but was beaten in the Last 16 by Michael van Gerwen, who went on to make the final, but lost 16\u201314 to Raymond van Barneveld.",
