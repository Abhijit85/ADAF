  "context": "\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is a short story by American writer Edgar Allan Poe, first published in 1843. It is relayed by an unnamed narrator who endeavors to convince the reader of the narrator\u2019s sanity while simultaneously describing a murder they committed. The victim was an old man with a filmy \"vulture-eye\", as the narrator calls it. The narrator emphasizes the careful calculation of the murder, attempting the perfect crime, complete with dismembering and hiding the body under the floorboards. Ultimately, the narrator's feelings of guilt, or a mental disturbance, result in hearing a thumping sound, which the narrator interprets as the dead man's beating heart.\n\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is a short story by American writer Edgar Allan Poe, first published in 1843.
