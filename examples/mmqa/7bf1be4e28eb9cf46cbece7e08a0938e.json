It was made with whipped chocolate, milk and coffee in equal parts, along with any amount of sugar, and possibly topped with cream. It was served warm in hot summer and cool in cold winter, usually to accompany desserts such as the Panettone or other Milanese delicacies.\n\nPanettone (pronounced /\u02ccp\u00e6n\u026a\u02c8to\u028ani/; Italian:\u00a0[panet\u02c8to\u02d0ne]) is an Italian type of sweet bread loaf originally from Milan (in Milanese dialect of the Lombard language it is called paneton, pronounced\u00a0[pane\u02c8tu\u014b] or [pane\u02c8t\u0169\u02d0]), usually prepared and enjoyed for Christmas and New Year in Western, Southern Europe and Southeastern as well as in Latin America, the Horn of Africa, and to a lesser extent in former French, Spanish and Portuguese colonies.",
