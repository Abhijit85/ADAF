  "context": "High School USA! is an American animated series produced by Friends Night and Animation Domination High-Def Studios. The series was created and written by Dino Stamatopoulos (creator of Moral Orel and Mary Shelley's Frankenhole). Nick Weidenfeld, Hend Baghdady and Stamatopoulos executive produce the series. The program holds a TV-MA rating for explicit language (L) and sexual content (S), making it the first show on Fox to be given such a rating since the short-lived 1990s show Action. However, most reruns of this show are rated TV-14 for suggestive dialogue (D), sexual content (S), offensive language (L), and/or graphic violence (V).\n\nMoral Orel is an American adult stop-motion animated television show, which originally aired on Adult Swim from December 13, 2005 to December 18, 2008. It has been described as \"Davey and Goliath... meets South Park\". However, Dino Stamatopoulos, the show's creator, is wary of the comparison with Davey and Goliath, telling the New York Times that Moral Orel grew out of a concept for a send-up of a Leave It to Beaver-style 1950s sitcom that would star Iggy Pop.",
