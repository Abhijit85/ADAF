  "context": "The B96 Pepsi SummerBash is an annual concert typically held on a Saturday in June, in the Chicago area. First held in 1992 and presented by Chicago radio station B96, the concert has been title-sponsored by Pepsi in recent years. In 2016, the event was held at Allstate Arena in the suburb of Rosemont. Previously, the event was held at Toyota Park in Bridgeview from 2006 to 2015. In 2006, the SummerBash was the first non-soccer event held at the stadium. Other venues that have played host to the event include the First Midwest Bank Amphitheater in Tinley Park, Joliet Raceway, and Maywood Park, all in the suburban Chicago area. Noted for featuring several marquee performers in a day-long series of sets, the event is considered to be one of the premier annual radio station concerts in the U.S. by many in the radio industry, along with events such as the 102.7 KIIS-FM's Jingle Ball, Wango Tango, Z100's Jingle Ball, and rock station 105.7 The Point - St. Louis' Point Fest. The success of the annual SummerBash concerts allowed the station to also begin a holiday variation of the event called the B96 Jingle Bash.\n\nAllstate Arena is a multi-purpose arena in Rosemont, Illinois, United States. It is home to the Chicago Wolves of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the Chicago Sky of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA).  It is located near the intersection of Mannheim Road and Interstate 90, adjacent to the city limits of Chicago and O'Hare International Airport. The facility opened in 1980 as Rosemont Horizon and seats 18,211 for basketball and 17,500 for ice hockey.",
