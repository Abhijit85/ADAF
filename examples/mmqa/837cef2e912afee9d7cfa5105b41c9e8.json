  "context": "Cartoon Planet was an American animated variety show that originally ran from 1995 to 1998,  and from March 30, 2012 to February 8, 2014 (in a different format) on Cartoon Network. A spin-off of the animated Space Ghost Coast to Coast talk show, the original premise was that Space Ghost had recruited his imprisoned evil nemesis Zorak and his loud and dimwitted archenemy Brak to assist him in hosting a variety show.\n\nGeorge Edward Lowe (born November 10, 1958) is an American voice actor and comedian. He is perhaps best known for his role as the voice of Space Ghost on the Cartoon Network/Adult Swim/GameTap animated series Space Ghost Coast to Coast; he also played the part for its spin-off Cartoon Planet. He continued to voice Space Ghost in several cameos in other programs for several years, even following the conclusion of the series. He has also made recurring voice appearances on Aqua Teen Hunger Force and Robot Chicken.",
