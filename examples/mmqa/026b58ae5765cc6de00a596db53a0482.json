  "context": "As hundreds of players have played for the team since it started officially registering its players in 1904, only players with 10 or more official goals are included. The national team's record goal-scorer is Thierry Henry, who scored 51 total goals in 123 competitive appearances for the team between 1997 and 2010. Henry surpassed Michel Platini, the previous all-time leading goal-scorer, on 17 October 2007 in a match against Lithuania. Henry is the only player to have reached the half-century mark in goals for the national team. Henry is followed by Platini, who scored 41 goals, David Tr\u00e9z\u00e9guet, who netted 34 goals, Olivier Giroud with 32 goals and Zinedine Zidane, with 31 goals. Henry, Tr\u00e9z\u00e9guet, and Zidane were members of the team that won the 1998 FIFA World Cup, while Platini captained France to victory at UEFA Euro 1984.",
