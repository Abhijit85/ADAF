  "context": "Randall Doo Hickey[a] (played by Ethan Suplee)[ii] \u2013 Earl's younger brother. He and Earl used to commit a bunch of crimes together, but he goes along with Earl on his list. In \"Monkeys in Space\", when he tries to get a job, Earl finds that he is unable to fulfill his list item in time until Randy helps him. In the episode \"Number One\", he breaks down and questions the entire process. His character was initially described as equally nasty and tough but after Earl started working on the list, he becomes naive, child-like, and simplistic. In \"Harassed a Reporter\" he is upset that the reporter portrayed him as mentally retarded, but when she mentions that it could be karma, he is happy that karma noticed him and considered him important.",
