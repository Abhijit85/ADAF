  "context": "Hedwig Jagiellon (Lithuanian: Jadvyga Jogailait\u0117, Polish: Jadwiga Jagiellonka; 8 April 1408, Krak\u00f3w \u2013 8 December 1431, Krak\u00f3w) was a Polish and Lithuanian princess, and a member of the Jagiellon dynasty. For most of her life she, as the only child of Wladyslaw Jagiello, was considered to be heiress of the Polish and Lithuanian thrones. After the birth of Jagiello's sons in 1424 and 1427, Hedwig had some support for her claims to the throne. She died in 1431 amidst rumors that she was poisoned by her stepmother Sophia of Halshany.\n\nAnna of Cilli or Anne of Celje (c.\u20091381 \u2013 21 May 1416) was Queen consort of Poland (1402\u20131416). She was the second wife of Jogaila (W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o), King of Poland and Supreme Duke of Lithuania (reigned 1387\u20131434). Their marriage was politically motivated to strengthen Jogaila's ties with the Piast dynasty and his claims to the Polish throne. Their marriage was rather distant and during fourteen years Anna bore only one daughter, Hedwig Jagiellon, who died without issue.",
