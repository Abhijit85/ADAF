  "context": "Masterpiece is a board game by Parker Brothers, now a brand of Hasbro.  Players participate in auctions for famous works of art. It was invented by Joseph M. Burck of Marvin Glass and Associates and originally published in 1970 by Parker Brothers, and then published again in 1976 and 1996. The game is now out-of-print.  In this game, players compete with other players to bid on potentially valuable paintings, and negotiate with other players to trade these works of art, build a portfolio, amass money, and win the game. The top value of a painting in the 1970 edition is $1 million, and $10 million in the 1996 edition; however, getting the full value for the painting requires some luck in landing on the right square on the board to sell a painting to the bank.\n\nDald\u00f8s [dal'd\u00f8s] is a running-fight board game only known from a few coastal locations in Scandinavia, where its history can be traced back to around 1800. The game is notable for its unusual four-sided dice (stick or long dice). In Denmark it is known as dald\u00f8s in Northern and Western Jutland (Mors, Thisted and Fan\u00f8), and possibly as daldos on Bornholm. In Norway it is known under the name of dald\u00f8sa from J\u00e6ren, where, unlike in Denmark, a continuous tradition of the dald\u00f8s game exists. A rather similar game called s\u00e1hkku, using virtually identical dice, is known in a number of variants from the Sea Sami in Northern Norway, Finland and Russia. Otherwise, the closest relatives of this game appear to be the t\u00e2b games from Northern Africa and South-western Asia, possibly apart from one unlabelled diagram in a codex from Southern England.",
