  "context": "Walter Ray Allen Jr. (born July 20, 1975) is an American former professional basketball player who played 18 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). After playing three seasons of college basketball for Connecticut, Allen entered the NBA in 1996 and went on to play for the Milwaukee Bucks, Seattle SuperSonics, Boston Celtics and Miami Heat. One of the most accurate three-point and free throw shooters in NBA history, he was a ten-time NBA All-Star, and won two NBA championships (2008, 2013) with the Celtics and Heat respectively. He also won an Olympic gold medal as a member of the 2000 United States men's basketball team. Allen is the NBA's all-time leader in career three-point field goals made in both the regular and postseason. He has acted in two films, one of which was a lead role in the 1998 Spike Lee film, He Got Game.\n\nThe 1999\u20132000 NBA season was the Bucks' 32nd season in the National Basketball Association. During the offseason, the Bucks acquired Danny Manning and re-acquired Dale Ellis from the Orlando Magic. With Sam Cassell playing a full season after missing most of the lockout season due to injury, the Bucks played above .500 in the first half of the season. However, they struggled in February posting a 3\u20139 record as Ellis was traded to the Charlotte Hornets. With less than a month to go, the Bucks playoff chances appeared bleak as they had a 32\u201337 record in late March. However, down the stretch, they won 10 of their final 13 games to sneak into the playoffs as the #8 seed in the Eastern Conference, finishing fifth in the Central Division with a 42\u201340 record. Ray Allen and Glenn Robinson were both selected for the 2000 NBA All-Star Game. ",
