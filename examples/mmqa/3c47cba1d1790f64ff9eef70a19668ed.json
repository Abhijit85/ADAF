  "context": "John Adams (October 30 [O.S. October 19]\u00a01735\u00a0\u2013 July 4, 1826) was an American patriot who served as the second President of the United States (1797\u20131801) and the first Vice President (1789\u201397). He was a lawyer, diplomat, statesman, political theorist, and, as a Founding Father, a leader of the movement for American independence from Great Britain. He was also a dedicated diarist and correspondent, particularly with his wife and closest advisor Abigail.\n\nJohn Marshall (September 24, 1755\u00a0\u2013 July 6, 1835) was an American politician. He was the fourth Chief Justice of the United States (1801\u20131835). His court opinions helped lay the basis for United States constitutional law and many[who?] say he made the Supreme Court of the United States a coequal branch of government along with the legislative and executive branches. Previously, Marshall had been a leader of the Federalist Party in Virginia and served in the United States House of Representatives from 1799 to 1800. He was Secretary of State under President John Adams from 1800 to 1801 and, at the age of 45, became the last of the chief justices to be born in Colonial America.",
