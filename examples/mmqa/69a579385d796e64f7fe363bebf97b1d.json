  "context": "On March 6, 2017, the Raiders revealed that Bank of America would be replacing Sheldon Adelson's portion of the funding for the new stadium in Las Vegas. On March 27, 2017, the National Football League officially approved the Raiders move from Oakland to Las Vegas in a 31\u20131 vote, ensuring them a new stadium in the process. However, even though the Raiders were approved to move to Las Vegas, the club will still play the 2017 and 2018 NFL seasons at the Oakland\u2013Alameda County Coliseum and still be known as the Oakland Raiders so as long as they play in the San Francisco Bay Area. About one thousand season ticket holders asked for and received refunds after the move to Las Vegas was announced. Their tickets were sold to other fans within hours, and the Raiders' 53,250 season tickets were all sold out by late May.",
