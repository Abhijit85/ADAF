  "context": "Post moved to Los Angeles and met FKi who introduced him to Rex Kudo who helped him produce \"White Iverson\". Post recorded the song two days after he wrote it. He thought of the name after getting braids in his hair, thinking he looked like a \"White Iverson\", a reference to the professional basketball player, Allen Iverson. Upon completion in February 2015, it was uploaded to Post's SoundCloud account. It quickly brought him attention from record labels, gaining over a million plays the month it was uploaded. He decided to sign with Republic Records.",
