  "context": "The Promociones Guti\u00e9rrez 1st Anniversary Show was a professional wrestling supercard event promoted by Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) and Promociones Gutierrez, CMLL's local promoter in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, Mexico. The event took place on July 12, 2010 at the Plaza de Toros Lauro Luis Longoria bullring and commemorated the 1st anniversary of Promociones Gutierrez. The focal point of the event was a Ruleta de la Muerte (Spanish for \"Roulette of Death\") tournament, in which five teams of Parejas Incredibles (teams of enemies) participate in an elimination match to see which team would have to face off in a Lucha de Apuestas, mask vs. mask match. The team of M\u00edstico and El Oriental lost the Ruleta de la Muerte and was forced to wrestle each other immediately after the Ruleta match. In the end M\u00edstico defeated El Oriental to unmask him.\n\nRoulette is a casino game named after the French word meaning little wheel. In the game, players may choose to place bets on either a single number, various groupings of numbers, the colors red or black, whether the number is odd or even, or if the numbers are high (19\u201336) or low (1\u201318).",
