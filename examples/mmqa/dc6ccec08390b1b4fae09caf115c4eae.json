  "context": "The Money Store is the debut studio album by the group Death Grips. It was officially released on April 24, 2012, but was leaked to YouTube on April 14 and made available on vinyl on April 21 to celebrate Record Store Day. It was announced along with a second album, which would be titled No Love Deep Web. It is the follow-up to their debut mixtape Exmilitary.\n\nAmerican band Death Grips has released six studio albums, one compilation album, three extended plays (EPs), one mixtape, seven singles, eight promotional singles, three remixes, and 42 music videos. The band was formed by MC Ride, Zach Hill, and Andy \"Flatlander\" Morin in Sacramento during the winter of 2010. In March 2011, they released their eponymous debut EP. The mixtape Exmilitary followed a month later and was praised by contemporary music critics. Death Grips signed a record deal with Epic Records in early 2012 and their debut studio album The Money Store was released in April to critical acclaim, peaking at number 130 on the Billboard 200 chart. Because Epic Records would not confirm a release date for their second studio album No Love Deep Web before 2013, Death Grips self-released the album in November 2012. As a result of this and the ensuing conflict between the band and the record label, Death Grips was dropped by Epic Records. No Love Deep Web received positive reviews and peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart.",
