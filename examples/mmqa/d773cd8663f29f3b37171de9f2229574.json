  "context": "The 2016 World Series was the 112th edition of Major League Baseball's championship series, a best-of-seven playoff between the National League (NL) champion Chicago Cubs and the American League (AL) champion Cleveland Indians, the first meeting of those franchises in postseason history. The Indians had home-field advantage because the AL had won the 2016 All-Star Game. It was also the last World Series to have home-field advantage determined by the All-Star Game results; beginning in 2017, home-field advantage is now awarded to the team with the better record.",
