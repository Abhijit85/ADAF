Although the search for evidence of life on Mars continues, many science fiction writers have imagined what extraterrestrial life on Mars might be like. Some writers also use the word Martian to describe a human colonist on Mars.\n\nHenry Olerich (1851\u20131927) was a utopian author from Nebraska.
