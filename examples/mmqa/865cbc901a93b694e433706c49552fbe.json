He was the lead singer with the 1960s rock and roll band The Troggs, whose hits included \"Wild Thing\" and \"With a Girl Like You\" (they reached number one in the US and the UK respectively). He wrote the song \"Love Is All Around\", which was featured in the films Four Weddings and a Funeral and \"Love Actually\".\n\nLove Actually is a 2003 Christmas-themed romantic comedy film written and directed by Richard Curtis. It features an ensemble cast, many of whom had worked with Curtis in previous film and television projects. The screenplay delves into different aspects of love as shown through ten separate stories involving a wide variety of individuals, many of whom are shown to be interlinked as their tales progress. Most of the film was filmed on location in London. The story begins five weeks before Christmas and is played out in a weekly countdown until the holiday, followed by an epilogue that takes place one month later.",
