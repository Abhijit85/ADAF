  "context": "A myth has grown that the scenes in the reed-filled riverbank were filmed in Dalyan, Turkey. But Katharine Hepburn's published book (p. 118) on the filming states 'We were about to head... back to Entebbe, but John (Huston) wanted to get shots of Bogie and me in the miles of high reeds before we come out into the lake...\". The reeds sequence was thus shot on location in Africa (Uganda and Congo) and London studios.",
