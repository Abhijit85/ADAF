  "context": "Arthur and the Revenge of Maltazard (French: Arthur et la vengeance de Maltazard, also known in North America as Arthur and the Invisibles 2 or simply Arthur 2) is a 2009 English-language French animated/live-action feature film co-written, co-produced and directed by Luc Besson, based on his novel of the same title and starring Freddie Highmore and Mia Farrow. EuropaCorp produced the film, which is the second in Besson's Arthur series, following Arthur and the Invisibles. The film received generally negative reviews by critics. It was a success in France but, due to its predecessor's failure at the American box office, was released direct-to-video in the United States. It performed disappointingly in the rest of the world. As a result, the film and its sequel, Arthur 3: The War of the Two Worlds, generated huge money losses for EuropaCorp.\n\nEd, Edd n Eddy is a Canadian-American animated comedy television series created by Danny Antonucci for Cartoon Network, and the sixth of the network's Cartoon Cartoons. The series revolves around three preteen boys named Ed, Edd (called \"Double D\"), and Eddy\u2014collectively known as \"the Eds\"\u2014who live in a suburban cul-de-sac in the fictional town of Peach Creek. Under the unofficial leadership of Eddy, the trio frequently invent schemes to make money from their peers to purchase their favorite confectionery, jawbreakers. Their plans usually fail, leaving them in various, often humiliating, predicaments.",
