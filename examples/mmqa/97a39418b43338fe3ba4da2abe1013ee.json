  "context": "Speedy Gonzales is an animated cartoon character in the Warner Brothers Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons. He is portrayed as \"The Fastest Mouse in all Mexico\" with his major traits being the ability to run extremely fast, speaking with an exaggerated Mexican accent and also speaking Spanish. He usually wears a yellow sombrero, white shirt and trousers (which was a common traditional outfit worn by men and boys of rural Mexican villages), and a red kerchief, similar to that of some traditional Mexican attires.[original research?] To date, there have been 46 cartoons made either starring or featuring this character.\n\nThe Frito Bandito was the cartoon mascot for Fritos corn chips from 1967 to 1971.  The Bandito was created by the Foote, Cone & Belding Agency, and animated by Tex Avery.  The character was voiced by Mel Blanc, who used an exaggerated Mexican accent not unlike another character of his, Speedy Gonzales.  The Frito Bandito spoke broken English and robbed people of their Fritos corn chips, a reference to the \"Mexican bandit\" stereotype in western movies.  He also complained that he was being pursued by the \"Frito Bureau of Investigation.\"",
