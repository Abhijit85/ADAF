  "context": "Shape Shifter is the twenty-first studio album (thirty-sixth album overall) by Santana. It was released on May 14, 2012. This album is the first from his new record label Starfaith Records, which is distributed by Sony Music Entertainment, owners of most of Santana's albums (except those recorded for Polydor Records which are owned by Universal Music Group). It is also the first album since 1992's Milagro that does not feature guest singers in any of the songs, a style that characterized Santana's albums since Supernatural. The album contains only one song with vocals (\"Eres La Luz\"). The track \"Mr. Szabo\" is a homage to the Hungarian guitarist G\u00e1bor Szab\u00f3, who released a series of 8 albums for Impulse Records between 1966 and 1967, and   one of Carlos Santana's early idols, and features a similar rhythmical and harmonic structure to \"Gypsy Queen\", a Szab\u00f3 hit from 1966 covered by Santana in 1970 as a medley with Fleetwood Mac's \"Black Magic Woman\".\n\nFleetwood Mac are  a British-American rock band, formed in London in 1967. The band have sold more than 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling bands. In 1998, selected members of Fleetwood Mac were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music.",
