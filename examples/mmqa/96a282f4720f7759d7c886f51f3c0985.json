  "context": "The Chronicles of Narnia is a series of seven fantasy novels by C. S. Lewis. It is considered a classic of children's literature and is the author's best-known work, having sold over 100 million copies in 47 languages. Written by Lewis, illustrated by Pauline Baynes, Chris Van Allsburg in 1978, and Leo and Diane Dillon in 1994, and originally published in London between 1950 and 1956, The Chronicles of Narnia has been adapted several times, complete or in part, for radio, television, the stage, and film.\n\nS\u00edtio do Picapau Amarelo (literally translated and roughly known as \"the Yellow Woodpecker Farm\" or \"the Yellow Woodpecker Ranch\") is the title given to a series of 23 fantasy novels written by Brazilian author Monteiro Lobato between 1920 and 1940. The series is considered representative of Brazilian children's literature and as the Brazilian equivalent to children's classics such as C. S. Lewis, The Chronicles of Narnia and L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz series. Lobato's single original adult fiction, a sci-fi novel entitled O Presidente Negro (\"The Black President\") set in the far future, would not achieve the same popularity of S\u00edtio. The concept was introduced in Monteiro Lobato's 1920 novel A Menina do Narizinho Arrebitado, and was later republished as the first chapter of Reina\u00e7\u00f5es de Narizinho, which is the first novel of the actual S\u00edtio series. The main setting is S\u00edtio do Picapau Amarelo, where a boy, a girl and their living and thinking toys enjoy exploring adventures in fantasy, discovery and learning.  On several occasions, they leave the ranch to explore other worlds such as Neverland, the mythological Ancient Greece, an underwater world known as the Clear Waters Kingdom, and outer space. S\u00edtio is often symbolized by the character of Em\u00edlia, Lobato's most famous creation alongside Jeca Tatu.",
