Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments mainly include: Dealer quotes for similar instruments; The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves; and Other techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine fair value for financial instruments. During the year ended 31 December 2019, there was 1 transfer between level 1 and 2 for recurring fair value measurements. For transfers in and out of level 3 measurements see the following table, which presents the changes of financial instruments in level 3 for the years ended 31 December 2019 and 2018:",
