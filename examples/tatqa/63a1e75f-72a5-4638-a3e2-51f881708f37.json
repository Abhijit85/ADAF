The Bell Canada pension plan has an investment arrangement which hedges part of its exposure to potential increases in longevity, which covers approximately $4\u00a0billion of post-employment benefit obligations. The fair value of the arrangement is included within other alternative investments. As a hedging arrangement of the pension plan, the transaction requires no cash contributions from BCE.",
