  "context": "The tax credit/(charge) for the period differs from the standard rate of corporation tax in the United Kingdom of 19.0% (2017/18: 19.0%). The reasons for this are explained below: The movements in losses recognised for the period ended 30 March 2019 is \u00a3nil (2017/18: \u00a31.1m). Corporation tax losses are not recognised where future recoverability is uncertain. The adjustments to prior periods of \u00a31.7m (2017/18: \u00a3(8.1m)) relate mainly to the adjustment of prior period losses and capital allowances which have been revised following submission of tax returns.",
