Our total Scope 1 and 2 emissions dropped by 6.14 per cent from 2018, and our emissions per $ million of revenue were down by 10.9 per cent. We have reduced our total emissions by 29 per cent since our 2014 baseline. The Group responded to the Carbon Disclosure Project in 2019, completing the Climate Change and Supply Chain questionnaires. In 2019 we achieved a Climate Change rating of B (management) (2018 C) and a Supplier Engagement rating of B (management) (2018 B). The average for our sector is C in both categories.",
