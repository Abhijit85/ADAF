  "context": "Cash Flows Fiscal Year 2019 Cash Flows Net cash provided by operations was $45.0 million for fiscal 2019 consisting of $24.2 million of net income and $47.6 million of non-cash charges, partially offset by an increase in working capital of $26.8 million. The increase in non-cash charges of $9.4 million is primarily driven by changes in the fair value of earn-out liabilities of $4.4 million and higher depreciation and amortization expense. The increase in working capital of $26.8 million is a result of organic growth and acquisitions and includes $1.8 million of earn-out liability payments classified as operating activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $44.2 million in fiscal 2019 driven by $16.1 million in capital expenditures which included implementations of our Enterprise Resource Planning system and the buildouts of our headquarters in Ridgefield, CT and distribution center in Dallas, Texas. The Company used $28.1 million in cash to fund acquisitions, the most significant of which was Bassian. Net cash provided by financing activities was $96.9 million for fiscal 2019 driven by $145.0 million of net proceeds received from the issuance of our Senior Notes, partially offset by $44.2 million to settle all borrowings outstanding on our ABL and $2.4 million of earn-out liability payments classified as financing activities. Fiscal Year 2018 Cash Flows Net cash provided by operations was $45.1 million for fiscal 2018 consisting of $20.4 million of net income and $38.2 million of non-cash charges, partially offset by a $13.5 million increase in working capital as a result of organic growth and acquisitions. Net cash used in investing activities was $33.7 million for fiscal 2018 driven by $19.8 million in capital expenditures which included implementations of our Enterprise Resource Planning system and the buildout of our distribution centers in Portland, OR, Dallas, TX and Toronto, Canada. The remaining cash used in investing activities of $13.9 million was mainly used to fund small strategic acquisitions. Net cash used in financing activities was $10.4 million for fiscal 2018 . During fiscal 2018, we entered into a new ABL which effectively doubled our borrowing capacity. We drew $47.1 million from the ABL to make an equivalent prepayment on our term loan which lowered the effective interest rates charged on our outstanding indebtedness. We also made additional principal payments of $5.2 million on our indebtedness, paid a $3.0 million earn-out related to our Fells Point acquisition, and made a $1.5 million payment for financing fees related to our new ABL.",
