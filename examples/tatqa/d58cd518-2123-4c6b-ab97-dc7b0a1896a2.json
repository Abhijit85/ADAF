  "context": "Net Loss Per Ordinary Share The Company calculates basic and diluted net loss per ordinary share by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.

The following potentially dilutive ordinary share equivalents have been excluded from the calculation of diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 as their effect would have been anti-dilutive for the periods presented (in thousands):",
