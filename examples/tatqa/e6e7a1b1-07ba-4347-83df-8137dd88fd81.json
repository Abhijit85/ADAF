The Company\u2019s material operating segments qualify for aggregation due to their customer base and similarities in economic characteristics, nature of products and services, and processes for procurement, manufacturing, and distribution. The Company operates in seven geographic regions: United States, China, Europe, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan. For geographical reporting, revenue is attributed to the geographic location in which the customers\u2019 facilities are located, while long-lived assets are attributed to the geographic locations in which the assets are located. Revenues and long-lived assets by geographic region were as follows: In fiscal year 2019, four customers accounted for approximately 15%, 14%, 14%, and 14% of total revenues, respectively.
