The potential for any share rights issued by the Group to dilute existing shareholders\u2019 ownership when the share rights are exercised are also presented. (1) Weighted average number of shares has been adjusted to remove shares held in trust by Woolworths Custodian Pty Ltd (as trustee of various employee share trusts) (2) Includes 8.0 million (2018: 3.4 million) shares deemed to be issued for no consideration in respect of employee performance rights. In 2019, the weighted average number of ordinary shares used in the calculation of EPS included the effect of the off-market share buy-back that was completed on 27 May 2019, resulting in 58.7 million ordinary shares being cancelled. Refer to Note 4.3 for further details on the share buy-back.",
