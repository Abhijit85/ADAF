The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $11.1 million, $1.4 million, and $1.4 million, respectively. The per-share weighted-average fair value of options granted during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $5.07, $4.56, and $4.28, respectively.
