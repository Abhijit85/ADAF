  "context": "Assets by Reportable Segments The following table shows assets allocated by reportable segment. Assets allocated by reportable segment include: trade receivables, net; inventory, net; property and equipment, net; goodwill; intangible assets, net and leased systems, net. (1) The assets allocated to segments as of December 31, 2018 have been revised to correct an error in the previous allocation of property and equipment. Assets allocated to Food Care were understated by $372.9 million with an offset to Product Care of $369.6 million and $3.3 million to assets not allocated. There is no impact to consolidated assets at December 31, 2018. This error did not impact the Company's annual assessment of goodwill impairment or any other impairment considerations of long-lived assets.",
