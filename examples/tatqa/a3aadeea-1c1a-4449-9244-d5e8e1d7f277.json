The change in the projected benefit obligation of our benefit plans was recognized as part of the net actuarial (gain) loss and is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a portion of which is subject to amortization over the remaining estimated life of plan participants, which was approximately 16 years as of December 31, 2019.
