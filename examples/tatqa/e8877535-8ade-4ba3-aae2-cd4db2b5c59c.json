  "context": "a. Analysis of revenue growth On a reported basis, TCS\u2019 revenue grew 19% in FY 2019, compared to 4.4% in the prior year.

In addition, there was some benefit from the movement in currency exchange rates. FY 2019 saw volatility in USD-INR, ranging from `64.90 and `74.10, and averaging at `70.07. There was also significant volatility in exchange rates of emerging markets\u2019 currencies.
