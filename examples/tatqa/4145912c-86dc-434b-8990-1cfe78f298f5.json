  "context": "Global Financing Receivables and Allowances The following table presents external Global Financing receivables excluding residual values, the allowance for credit losses and immaterial miscellaneous receivables: (1) Includes deferred initial direct costs which are eliminated in IBM\u2019s consolidated results. The percentage of Global Financing receivables reserved was 1.0 percent at December 31, 2019, compared to 0.9 percent at December 31, 2018. The decline in the allowance for credit losses was driven by write-offs of $64 million, primarily of receivables previously reserved, and net releases of $7 million as a result of lower average asset balances in client and commercial financing. See note K, \u201cFinancing Receivables,\u201d for additional information.",
