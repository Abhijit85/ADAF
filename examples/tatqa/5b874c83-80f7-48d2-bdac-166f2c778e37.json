Interest income increased due to higher interest rates. Other expense in the year ended December 31, 2018, was driven by foreign currency translation losses mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and the Euro. Other income in the year ended December 31, 2017 was driven mainly by foreign currency translation gains due to the depreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and the Euro.",
