=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of employee distribution and operational challenges in the airline industry reveals significant insights into labor allocation and cost management. 

1. American Airlines has the highest proportion of pilots relative to its total employees, with 7900 out of 60100, equating to approximately 13.1%, highlighting its focus on pilot staffing compared to other roles.
2. Wholly-owned Regional Carriers exhibit a high concentration of passenger service personnel, with 6400 out of 18200 employees, or about 35.2%, indicating a strategic emphasis on customer service operations.
3. American Airlines stands out with a significantly larger number of flight attendants (15000) compared to US Airways (7700) and Wholly-owned Regional Carriers (2100), suggesting a greater capacity for passenger service.
4. Labor costs, accounting for 22% of operating expenses in 2013, are a critical factor, with regulatory developments potentially increasing these costs and impacting operations if infrastructure needs are unmet.

Answer Echoes:
- [RATIO] American has the highest proportion of pilots relative to its total employees: 7,900 out of 60,100, which is approximately 13.1%.
- [RATIO] Wholly-owned Regional Carriers have a notably high proportion of passenger service personnel: 6,400 out of 18,200, which is approximately 35.2%.
- [ANOMALY] US Airways has the same number of administrative and other personnel as fleet service personnel: 5,500 each.
- [OUTLIER] American has significantly more flight attendants (15,000) compared to US Airways (7,700) and Wholly-owned Regional Carriers (2,100).
- [TREND] Across all categories, American consistently has the highest number of employees compared to US Airways and Wholly-owned Regional Carriers.
- [OUTLIER] Wholly-owned Regional Carriers have the lowest number of maintenance personnel (2,400) compared to American (11,300) and US Airways (3,100).
- [ANOMALY] The total number of passenger service personnel (22,900) is higher than the total number of pilots (15,400) across all groups.
- [DEFINITION] "Salaries, wages, and benefits" are major operating expenses, at 22% in 2013.
- [SCOPE] Focuses on regulatory impacts and labor costs within the airline industry.
- [SOURCE] Information from "part i, item 1a. risk factors" and employee data as of December 31, 2013.
- [NOTE] Regulatory developments could "increase operating costs" and affect operations.
- [WARNING] Potential "material adverse impact" on operations if infrastructure needs aren't met.
