=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of the airline industry highlights significant disparities in personnel distribution and the impact of regulatory and labor costs on operations.

1. American Airlines leads in pilot numbers with 7900, representing 51.3% of the total pilots, and has the largest share of flight attendants at 15000, accounting for 60.5% of the total.
2. Wholly-owned Regional Carriers exhibit an unusual pattern with more passenger service personnel (6400) than flight attendants (2100), and their passenger service personnel exceed the combined total of their pilots, flight attendants, and maintenance personnel (7900).
3. Maintenance personnel at American are notably higher at 11300, making up 67.3% of the total, compared to US Airways (3100) and Wholly-owned Regional Carriers (2400).
4. The financial report underscores that salaries, wages, and benefits constituted 22% of operating expenses in 2013, with regulatory compliance and labor costs posing potential risks to operational costs and efficiency.
