=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the sum of the value of the notes Entergy issued to NYPA with seven and eight annual installment payments?

**Calculation**:
1. **Seven Annual Installments**:
   - Entergy issued notes to NYPA with seven annual installments of approximately $108 million each.
   - Total for seven installments = 7 installments × $108 million per installment
   - Total = 7 × 108 = $756 million

2. **Eight Annual Installments**:
   - Entergy also issued notes with eight annual installments of $20 million each.
   - Total for eight installments = 8 installments × $20 million per installment
   - Total = 8 × 20 = $160 million

3. **Sum of Both Installment Plans**:
   - Sum = Total for seven installments + Total for eight installments
   - Sum = $756 million + $160 million = $916 million

**Answer**: The sum of the value of the notes Entergy issued to NYPA with seven and eight annual installment payments is $916 million.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context.
