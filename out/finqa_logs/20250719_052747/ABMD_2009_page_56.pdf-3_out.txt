=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What portion of operating lease commitments is expected to be paid within 12 months?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base**: Total Operating Lease Commitments = $10690000
2. **Identify Part**: Operating Lease Commitments due in Less than 1 Year = $2313000
3. **Calculate Percentage**: 
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{2313000}{10690000}\right) \times 100
   \]
4. **Perform Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = 0.2163 \times 100 = 21.63\%
   \]

**Answer**: 21.63% of the operating lease commitments is expected to be paid within 12 months.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data.

Answer Echoes:
- From the table: Total Operating Lease Commitments = $10,690,000
- From the table: Operating Lease Commitments due in Less than 1 Year = $2,313,000
- **Total Operating Lease Commitments**: $10,690,000 (from the table)
- **Operating Lease Commitments due in Less than 1 Year**: $2,313,000 (from the table)
- Total Operating Lease Commitments = $10,690,000
- Operating Lease Commitments due in Less than 1 Year = $2,313,000
