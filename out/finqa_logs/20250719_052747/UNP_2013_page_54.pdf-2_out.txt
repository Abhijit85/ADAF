=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In 2013, what was the percent of the total operating revenues from Mexico?

**Calculation**:
1. **Revenues from Mexico**: $2.1 billion (from text context)
2. **Total Operating Revenues**: This figure is not provided in the text or table. To calculate the percentage, we need this total revenue figure.

   Assuming you have access to the total operating revenues for 2013 from another source, you can use the following formula to calculate the percentage:

   \[
   \text{Percentage from Mexico} = \left( \frac{\text{Revenues from Mexico}}{\text{Total Operating Revenues}} \right) \times 100
   \]

   For example, if the total operating revenues were $20 billion, the calculation would be:

   \[
   \text{Percentage from Mexico} = \left( \frac{2.1}{20} \right) \times 100 = 10.5\%
   \]

**Answer**: The percentage of total operating revenues from Mexico in 2013 cannot be calculated without the total operating revenues figure. If you have this figure, you can use the formula provided to determine the percentage.

**Source**: Combined analysis using text context for revenues from Mexico and hypothetical total operating revenues for illustration.

Answer Echoes:
- **Arithmetic Type**: Percentage calculation
- **Data Requirements**: Total operating revenues for 2013 and revenues from Mexico for 2013
- **Revenues from Mexico**: The text states that revenues from Mexico amounted to $2.1 billion in 2013.
- The table data does not provide total operating revenues directly. However, the text context mentions that the table does not specify revenue figures from Mexico, indicating that the total operating revenue figure is not directly available from the table.
- To calculate the percentage of total operating revenues from Mexico, we need the formula:
- **Revenues from Mexico**: $2.1 billion (from text)
- **Total Operating Revenues**: Not directly provided in the text or table
- To calculate the percentage, the total operating revenues for 2013 are needed. This information is not provided in the text or table, so additional context or data is required to proceed with the calculation.
