=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the variation observed between the tangible and intangible assets, in millions?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Values**:
   - Tangible Assets = $14.0 million
   - Intangible Assets = $8.5 million

2. **Calculate the Variation**:
   - Variation = Tangible Assets - Intangible Assets
   - Variation = $14.0 million - $8.5 million

3. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - Variation = $5.5 million

**Answer**: The variation observed between the tangible and intangible assets is $5.5 million.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context.

- Prior investment in HPL: $1,872,000
- Acquisition-related costs: $2,831,000
- Total purchase price: $15,704,000
- **Intangible Assets**: $8.5 million
- Core developed technology: $5.1 million
- Customer relationships: $3.2 million
- Backlog: $0.2 million
- **Tangible Assets**: $14.0 million
- Tangible Assets = $14.0 million
- Intangible Assets = $8.5 million
- Variation = Tangible Assets - Intangible Assets
- Variation = $14.0 million - $8.5 million
- Variation = $5.5 million
- Tangible Assets: $14.0 million (from text context)
- Intangible Assets: $8.5 million (from text context)
- Variation = $14.0 million - $8.5 million = $5.5 million
