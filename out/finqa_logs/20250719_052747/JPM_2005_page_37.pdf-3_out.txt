=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Without the Asset & Wealth Management segment in 2015, what would total operating income have been in US$ millions?

**Calculation**: 
To determine the total operating income without the Asset & Wealth Management segment for 2015, we need the following data:
1. **Total Operating Earnings for 2015**: This figure needs to be extracted from the financial documents or tables for the year 2015.
2. **Operating Earnings for Asset & Wealth Management for 2015**: This figure also needs to be extracted from the financial documents or tables for the year 2015.

Once these figures are available, the calculation would be:
\[
\text{Adjusted Total Operating Earnings} = \text{Total Operating Earnings} - \text{Asset & Wealth Management Operating Earnings}
\]

**Answer**: Without the specific data for 2015, the exact adjusted total operating income cannot be calculated. Please provide the necessary financial figures for 2015 to proceed with the calculation.

**Source**: Combined analysis (requires table data for 2015)

Answer Echoes:
- Total Operating Earnings = $10,521 million
- Asset & Wealth Management Operating Earnings = $1,216 million
- **Total Operating Earnings for 2015**: This number would be extracted from the financial documents or tables for the year 2015.
- **Operating Earnings for Asset & Wealth Management for 2015**: This number would also be extracted from the financial documents or tables for the year 2015.
- Insert the extracted numbers into the formula to calculate the adjusted total operating earnings for 2015.
- Present the result in US$ millions with appropriate formatting.
