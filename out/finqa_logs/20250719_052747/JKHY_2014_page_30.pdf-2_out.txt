**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- JKHY stock value in 2009: 100.00
- JKHY stock value in 2010: 116.85
- Change = 116.85 - 100.00 = 16.85
- Percentage Change = (Change / 2009 Value) × 100
- Percentage Change = (16.85 / 100.00) × 100
- Percentage Change = 16.85%
- **JKHY Stock Value in 2009**: 100.00
- **JKHY Stock Value in 2010**: 116.85
- The context provides a comparison of the market performance of JKHY stock over a five-year period, assuming an initial investment of $100 on June 30, 2009, with reinvestment of dividends.
- JKHY stock value in 2009: 100.00
- JKHY stock value in 2010: 116.85
- Change = 116.85 - 100.00 = 16.85
- Percentage Change = (Change / 2009 Value) × 100
- Percentage Change = (16.85 / 100.00) × 100
- Percentage Change = 16.85%
- The calculation of the percentage change in the stock value from 2009 to 2010 is straightforward. The increase in stock value from $100.00 to $116.85 results in a change of $16.85, which translates to a 16.85% increase when expressed as a percentage of the 2009 value.
