=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: If there were a 100bp rise in rates, how much more would the impact be on earnings in 2009 vs. 2008?

**Calculation**:
1. Identify the impact on earnings for a 100bp rise in rates:
   - 2009: $(554) million
   - 2008: $672 million

2. Calculate the difference in impact between 2009 and 2008:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Impact in 2009} - \text{Impact in 2008}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = (-554) - 672
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = -554 - 672 = -1226
   \]

**Answer**: The impact on earnings in 2009 was $1226 million more negative than in 2008 with a 100bp rise in rates.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data.

Answer Echoes:
- Impact on earnings for a 100bp rise in rates in 2009: $(554) million
- Impact on earnings for a 100bp rise in rates in 2008: $672 million
- Impact on earnings for a 100bp rise in rates in 2009: $(554) million
- Impact on earnings for a 100bp rise in rates in 2008: $672 million
