=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the growth rate of maximum exposure to loss from VIEs from 2016 to 2017?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Relevant Figures**:
   - Maximum exposure to loss from VIEs in 2016: $210 million
   - Maximum exposure to loss from VIEs in 2017: $259 million

2. **Calculate the Growth Rate**:
   - Formula for growth rate: \((\text{Current Year Value} - \text{Previous Year Value}) / \text{Previous Year Value} \times 100\)

3. **Apply the Values**:
   - Growth Rate = \((259 - 210) / 210 \times 100\)

4. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - Difference = \(259 - 210 = 49\)
   - Growth Rate = \((49 / 210) \times 100\)
   - Growth Rate ≈ \(23.33\%\)

**Answer**: The growth rate of maximum exposure to loss from VIEs from 2016 to 2017 is approximately 23.33%.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Maximum exposure to loss from VIEs in 2016 (assumed to be "Guarantees"): $210 million
- Maximum exposure to loss from VIEs in 2017 (assumed to be "Guarantees"): $259 million
- Formula for growth rate: \((\text{Current Year Value} - \text{Previous Year Value}) / \text{Previous Year Value} \times 100\)
- Growth Rate = \((259 - 210) / 210 \times 100\)
- Difference = \(259 - 210 = 49\)
- Growth Rate = \((49 / 210) \times 100\)
- Growth Rate ≈ \(23.33\%\)
- Maximum exposure to loss from VIEs in 2016 (assumed to be "Guarantees"): $210 million
- Maximum exposure to loss from VIEs in 2017 (assumed to be "Guarantees"): $259 million
- The context confirms that the company deals with VIEs and provides financial support, which aligns with the assumption that "Guarantees" represent the maximum exposure to loss from VIEs.
- 2016 Maximum Exposure: $210 million
- 2017 Maximum Exposure: $259 million
- Formula for growth rate: \((\text{Current Year Value} - \text{Previous Year Value}) / \text{Previous Year Value} \times 100\)
- Growth Rate = \((259 - 210) / 210 \times 100\)
- Difference = \(259 - 210 = 49\)
- Growth Rate = \((49 / 210) \times 100\)
- Growth Rate ≈ \(23.33\%\)
- 2016 Maximum Exposure: $210 million
- 2017 Maximum Exposure: $259 million
- Growth Rate = \((259 - 210) / 210 \times 100 = 23.33\%\)
