=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What portion of the adjusted consolidated cash flow for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, is related to tower cash flow?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base**: The base is the adjusted consolidated cash flow for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005.
   - Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow = $531822 (in thousands)

2. **Identify Part**: The part related to tower cash flow is the "Four times Tower Cash Flow for the three months ended December 31, 2005".
   - Four times Tower Cash Flow = $558360 (in thousands)

3. **Calculate Percentage**: 
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Four times Tower Cash Flow}}{\text{Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow}}\right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{558360}{531822}\right) \times 100
   \]

4. **Perform Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = 1.0499 \times 100 \approx 104.99\%
   \]

**Answer**: The portion of the adjusted consolidated cash flow for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, that is related to tower cash flow is approximately 104.99%. This indicates that the tower cash flow component exceeds the adjusted consolidated cash flow, likely due to adjustments or other components in the calculation.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow = $531,822
- Four times Tower Cash Flow for the three months = $558,360
- **Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow** for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005: $531,822 (in thousands)
- **Four times Tower Cash Flow** for the three months ended December 31, 2005: $558,360 (in thousands)
- Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow = $531,822
- Four times Tower Cash Flow = $558,360
