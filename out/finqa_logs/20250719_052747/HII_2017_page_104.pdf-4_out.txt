=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the ratio of the deferred tax assets for the state income tax credit carry-forwards to the net operating loss carry-forward?

**Calculation**:
1. **Deferred Tax Asset for State Income Tax Credit Carry-forwards**: $16 million
2. **Deferred Tax Asset for Net Operating Loss Carry-forward**: $3 million

To find the ratio, divide the deferred tax asset for the state income tax credit carry-forwards by the deferred tax asset for the net operating loss carry-forward:

\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Deferred Tax Asset for State Income Tax Credit Carry-forwards}}{\text{Deferred Tax Asset for Net Operating Loss Carry-forward}} = \frac{16 \text{ million}}{3 \text{ million}}
\]

\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{16}{3} \approx 5.33
\]

**Answer**: The ratio of the deferred tax assets for the state income tax credit carry-forwards to the net operating loss carry-forward is approximately 5.33.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context.

Answer Echoes:
- From the financial context: "A deferred tax asset of approximately $16 million (net of federal benefit) has been established related to these state income tax credit carry-forwards."
- From the financial context: "A deferred tax asset of approximately $3 million (net of federal benefit) has been established for the net operating loss carry-forward."
- **Ratio Calculation**: To find the ratio of the deferred tax assets for the state income tax credit carry-forwards to the net operating loss carry-forward, we divide the deferred tax asset for the state income tax credit carry-forwards by the deferred tax asset for the net operating loss carry-forward.
