=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the change in millions for the estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in credit spreads on derivatives (including hedges) between 2017 and 2016?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Sensitivity Values**:
   - 2017 Sensitivity: $3 million
   - 2016 Sensitivity: $2 million

2. **Calculate the Change**:
   - Change = Sensitivity in 2017 - Sensitivity in 2016
   - Change = $3 million - $2 million

3. **Result**:
   - Change = $1 million

**Answer**: The change in millions for the estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in credit spreads on derivatives (including hedges) between 2017 and 2016 was $1 million.

**Source**: Text Context

Answer Echoes:
- **2017 Sensitivity**: The estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in credit spreads on derivatives (including hedges) was a gain of $3 million.
- **2016 Sensitivity**: The estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in credit spreads on derivatives (including hedges) was a gain of $2 million.
- 2017: $3 million
- 2016: $2 million
- Change = Sensitivity in 2017 - Sensitivity in 2016
- Change = $3 million - $2 million
- Change = $1 million
