=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What percent decrease for interest income occurred between 2014 and 2015?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Change in Interest Income**:
   - 2014 Interest Income: $27.4 million
   - 2015 Interest Income: $22.8 million
   - Change = 2015 Interest Income - 2014 Interest Income
   - Change = $22.8 million - $27.4 million = -$4.6 million

2. **Calculate the Percent Decrease**:
   - Percent Decrease = (Change / 2014 Interest Income) × 100
   - Percent Decrease = (-$4.6 million / $27.4 million) × 100
   - Percent Decrease = -0.1679 × 100 = -16.79%

**Answer**: The interest income decreased by 16.79% between 2014 and 2015.

**Source**: Combined analysis using text context for interest income figures.

Answer Echoes:
- 2014 Fair Market Value Change (10% Increase in Interest Rates): $(35.5)
- 2015 Fair Market Value Change (10% Increase in Interest Rates): $(33.7)
- Change = 2015 Value - 2014 Value
- Change = $(33.7) - $(35.5) = $1.8
- Percent Decrease = (Change / 2014 Value) × 100
- Percent Decrease = ($1.8 / $35.5) × 100
- Percent Decrease = 0.0507 × 100 = 5.07%
- **2014 Interest Income**: $27.4 million
- **2015 Interest Income**: $22.8 million
- Change = 2015 Interest Income - 2014 Interest Income
- Change = $22.8 million - $27.4 million = -$4.6 million
- Percent Decrease = (Change / 2014 Interest Income) × 100
- Percent Decrease = (-$4.6 million / $27.4 million) × 100
- Percent Decrease = -0.1679 × 100 = -16.79%
