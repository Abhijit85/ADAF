Answer Echoes:
- **2017 Defined Contribution Plans Expense**: $47.9 million
- **2016 Defined Contribution Plans Expense**: $42.5 million
- 2017 Expense: $47.9 million
- 2016 Expense: $42.5 million
- Change = 2017 Expense - 2016 Expense
- Change = $47.9 million - $42.5 million
- Change = $5.4 million
- 2017 Defined Contribution Plans Expense: $47.9 million
- 2016 Defined Contribution Plans Expense: $42.5 million
- Change = $47.9 million - $42.5 million = $5.4 million
