=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What are the total contingent payments relating to Impella?

**Calculation**:
1. Identify contingent payments from text:
   - FDA approval of Impella 2.5: $5583333
   - FDA approval of Impella 5.0: $5583333
   - Sale of 1000 units of Impella products: $5583334

2. Sum the contingent payments:
   - Total = $5583333 (Impella 2.5) + $5583333 (Impella 5.0) + $5583334 (1000 units sold)
   - Total = $16750000

**Answer**: $16750000

**Source**: Text context (as the table did not provide relevant data)

Answer Echoes:
- Upon FDA approval of the Impella 2.5 device: $5,583,333
- Upon FDA approval of the Impella 5.0 device: $5,583,333
- Upon the sale of 1,000 units of Impella’s products worldwide: $5,583,334
- The milestones related to sales and FDA approval of the Impella 2.5 device were achieved and paid prior to March 31, 2009.
- In April 2009, the company received FDA 510(k) clearance of its Impella 5.0 product, triggering the obligation to pay the milestone related to the Impella 5.0 device.
- In May 2009, the company paid $1.8 million of this final milestone in cash and elected to pay the remaining amount through the issuance of approximately 664,612 shares of common stock.
- Total contingent payments = $5,583,333 (Impella 2.5 approval) + $5,583,333 (Impella 5.0 approval) + $5,583,334 (1,000 units sold)
- Total contingent payments = $5,583,333 + $5,583,333 + $5,583,334 = $16,750,000
