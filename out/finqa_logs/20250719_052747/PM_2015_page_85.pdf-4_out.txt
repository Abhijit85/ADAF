=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the change in millions of trade receivables sold from 2014 to 2015?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the trade receivables sold for each year**:
   - 2015: $888 million
   - 2014: $120 million

2. **Calculate the change in trade receivables sold from 2014 to 2015**:
   \[
   \text{Change} = \text{Trade Receivables 2015} - \text{Trade Receivables 2014}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Change} = 888 \, \text{million} - 120 \, \text{million} = 768 \, \text{million}
   \]
