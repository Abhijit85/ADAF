=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the growth rate in the price of shares from the highest value during the quarter ended December 31, 2008, to the closing price on February 13, 2009?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Required Data**:
   - Highest value during Q4 2008: $37.28 (from table)
   - Closing price on February 13, 2009: $28.85 (from text context)

2. **Calculate the Change in Price**:
   - Change in price = $28.85 - $37.28 = -$8.43

3. **Calculate the Growth Rate**:
   - Growth Rate Formula: \((\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}) / \text{Old Value} \times 100\%\)
   - Growth rate = \((-8.43 / 37.28) \times 100\% = -22.61\%\)

**Answer**: The growth rate in the price of shares from the highest value during the quarter ended December 31, 2008, to the closing price on February 13, 2009, is \(-22.61\%\).

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- **Arithmetic Type**: Percentage change (growth rate)
- **Data Requirements**: Highest share price in Q4 2008, Closing share price on February 13, 2009
- **Context Needs**: Closing price on February 13, 2009, is provided in the text context
- **Highest value during the quarter ended December 31, 2008**: $37.28
- **Closing price on February 13, 2009**: $28.85
- **Growth Rate Formula**: \((\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}) / \text{Old Value} \times 100\%\)
- Highest value in Q4 2008: $37.28
- Closing price on February 13, 2009: $28.85
- Calculate the change in price: \(28.85 - 37.28 = -8.43\)
- Calculate the growth rate: \((-8.43 / 37.28) \times 100\% = -22.61\%\)
- The result is negative, indicating a decrease in the share price.
- The growth rate is presented as a percentage with two decimal places for precision.
- Highest value during Q4 2008: $37.28
- Closing price on February 13, 2009: $28.85
- Change in price: $28.85 - $37.28 = -$8.43
- Growth rate: \((-8.43 / 37.28) \times 100\% = -22.61\%\)
