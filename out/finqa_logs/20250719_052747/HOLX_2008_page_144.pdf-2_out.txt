=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What portion of the Suros acquisition price is paid in cash?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Cash Component**:
   - From the text context, it is stated that the cash paid was $139000.

2. **Calculate the Cash Portion**:
   - Total acquisition price = $248100
   - Cash paid = $139000

3. **Calculate the Percentage of Cash Payment**:
   - Cash portion percentage = (Cash paid / Total acquisition price) × 100
   - Cash portion percentage = ($139000 / $248100) × 100 ≈ 56.03%

**Answer**: Approximately 56.03% of the Suros acquisition price was paid in cash.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context and table data.

Answer Echoes:
- Net tangible assets acquired
- In-process research and development
- Developed technology and know-how
- Customer relationship
- Trade name
- Deferred income taxes
- Goodwill
- The acquisition of Suros Surgical Systems, Inc. was completed with an initial aggregate purchase price of approximately $248,100.
- The components of the purchase price included:
- 4,600 shares of Hologic common stock valued at $106,500.
- Cash paid of $139,000.
- Approximately $2,600 for acquisition-related fees and expenses.
- The table data does not explicitly mention the cash payment component, but it lists various components that make up the final purchase price, such as net tangible assets, in-process research and development, developed technology and know-how, customer relationship, trade name, deferred income taxes, and goodwill.
- From the text context, it is stated that the cash paid was $139,000.
- Total acquisition price = $248,100
- Cash paid = $139,000
- Cash portion percentage = (Cash paid / Total acquisition price) × 100
- Cash portion percentage = ($139,000 / $248,100) × 100 ≈ 56.03%
- Cash paid = $139,000 (from text context)
- Total acquisition price = $248,100 (from text context)
- Cash portion percentage = ($139,000 / $248,100) × 100 ≈ 56.03%
