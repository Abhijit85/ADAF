=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Considering the GAAP basis, what was the growth observed in the effective tax rate during 2012 and 2013?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Effective Tax Rates**:
   - Effective Tax Rate for 2013: 22.8%
   - Effective Tax Rate for 2012: 21.9%

2. **Calculate the Growth in the Effective Tax Rate**:
   - Growth in percentage points = Effective Tax Rate in 2013 - Effective Tax Rate in 2012
   - Growth = 22.8% - 21.9% = 0.9 percentage points

3. **Calculate the Growth Rate as a Percentage**:
   - Growth Rate = (Growth in percentage points / Effective Tax Rate in 2012) * 100
   - Growth Rate = (0.9 / 21.9) * 100 ≈ 4.11%

**Answer**: The growth observed in the effective tax rate from 2012 to 2013 on a GAAP basis was approximately 0.9 percentage points, which translates to a growth rate of about 4.11%.

**Source**: Combined (Text context for effective tax rates)

Answer Echoes:
- The effective tax rate for 2013 is 22.8%.
- The effective tax rate for 2012 is 21.9%.
- 2013: 22.8%
- 2012: 21.9%
- Growth in percentage points = Effective Tax Rate in 2013 - Effective Tax Rate in 2012
- Growth = 22.8% - 21.9% = 0.9 percentage points
- Growth Rate = (Growth in percentage points / Effective Tax Rate in 2012) * 100
- Growth Rate = (0.9 / 21.9) * 100 ≈ 4.11%
