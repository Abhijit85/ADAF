=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the percentage of tax and accounting fees among the total acquisition-related costs?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Base and Part**:
   - **Base**: Total acquisition-related costs = $2.8 million
   - **Part**: Tax and accounting fees = $1.6 million

2. **Calculate the Percentage**:
   - Formula: \((\text{Part} / \text{Base}) \times 100\)
   - Calculation: \((1.6 \text{ million} / 2.8 \text{ million}) \times 100 = 57.14\%\)

**Answer**: The percentage of tax and accounting fees among the total acquisition-related costs is 57.14%.

**Source**: Combined analysis using text context for specific figures.

Answer Echoes:
- **Base**: Total acquisition-related costs
- **Part**: Tax and accounting fees (not directly provided in the table)
- Acquisition-related costs: $2,831,000 (since the table is in thousands)
- From the text context, the total acquisition-related costs are $2.8 million.
- The text context specifies that tax and accounting fees amount to $1.6 million.
- **Base**: Total acquisition-related costs = $2.8 million
- **Part**: Tax and accounting fees = $1.6 million
- Formula: \((\text{Part} / \text{Base}) \times 100\)
- Calculation: \((1.6 \text{ million} / 2.8 \text{ million}) \times 100 = 57.14\%\)
- Total acquisition-related costs = $2.8 million
- Tax and accounting fees = $1.6 million
- Percentage of tax and accounting fees = \((1.6 / 2.8) \times 100 = 57.14\%\)
