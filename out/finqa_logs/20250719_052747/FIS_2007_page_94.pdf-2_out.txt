=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What portion of the future minimum operating lease payments is due in the next 12 months?

**Calculation**:
1. Identify the payment due in the next 12 months from the table:
   - 2008 Payment: $83382
2. Identify the total future minimum operating lease payments from the table:
   - Total Payments: $249038
3. Calculate the portion due in the next 12 months:
   \[
   \text{Portion due in next 12 months} = \frac{\text{2008 Payment}}{\text{Total Payments}} \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Portion due in next 12 months} = \frac{83382}{249038} \times 100 \approx 33.49\%
   \]

**Answer**: 33.49% of the future minimum operating lease payments is due in the next 12 months.

**Source**: Table data.

Answer Echoes:
- **2008 Payment**: $83,382
- **2008 Payment**: $83,382
- **Total Future Minimum Operating Lease Payments**: $249,038
- No additional context from the text is needed for this specific calculation.
- 2008 Payment: $83,382
- Total Payments: $249,038
- Calculate the percentage of the 2008 payment relative to the total payments.
