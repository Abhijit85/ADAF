=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What are the total sales reported in 2012, in billion?

**Calculation**:
1. From the text context, we know that the RD&E investments in 2012 were $1.2 billion, which represented 14% of net sales.
2. Let the total sales in 2012 be \( X \).
3. The relationship given is:
   \[
   0.14 \times X = 1.2 \text{ billion}
   \]
4. Solving for \( X \):
   \[
   X = \frac{1.2}{0.14} \text{ billion}
   \]
   \[
   X = 8.5714 \text{ billion}
   \]

**Answer**: The total sales reported in 2012 were approximately $8.57 billion.

**Source**: Text context analysis.
