=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the increase in Class A common stock issued and outstanding between the years, in thousands?

**Calculation**:
1. Identify the values from the table:
   - Class A common stock issued and outstanding in 2017: 339235 (in thousands)
   - Class A common stock issued and outstanding in 2016: 338240 (in thousands)

2. Calculate the difference:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 339235 - 338240 = 995
   \]

**Answer**: 995 (in thousands)

**Source**: Table data

The calculation is straightforward, involving a simple subtraction to determine the increase in Class A common stock issued and outstanding between 2016 and 2017. The result is verified for accuracy and presented in thousands, consistent with the data format.

Answer Echoes:
- Class A common stock issued and outstanding in 2017: 339,235 (in thousands)
- Class A common stock issued and outstanding in 2016: 338,240 (in thousands)
- The result is positive, indicating an increase.
- The increase is expressed in thousands.
- **Arithmetic Type**: Difference
- **Data Requirements**: Class A common stock issued and outstanding for 2016 and 2017
- **Context Needs**: None specifically needed beyond the table data
- **Calculation Steps**: Simple subtraction to find the difference
- **Exact Numbers**:
- Class A common stock issued and outstanding in 2017: 339,235 (in thousands)
- Class A common stock issued and outstanding in 2016: 338,240 (in thousands)
- **Calculate the Difference**:
- 2017: 339,235 (in thousands)
- 2016: 338,240 (in thousands)
- \( 339,235 - 338,240 = 995 \)
