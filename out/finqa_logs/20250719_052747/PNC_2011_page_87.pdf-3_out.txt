=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: For 2012, what percent of the home equity lines of credit interest only product was due to home equity lines of credit with balloon payments?

**Calculation**:
1. **Base**: Total home equity lines of credit interest only product for 2012 = $904 million.
2. **Part**: Home equity lines of credit with balloon payments scheduled to end in 2012 = $306 million (assumed to be part of the interest only product based on context).
3. **Percentage Calculation**: 
   - Percentage = (Part / Base) * 100
   - Percentage = ($306 million / $904 million) * 100
   - Percentage ≈ 33.85%

**Answer**: Approximately 33.85% of the home equity lines of credit interest only product for 2012 was due to home equity lines of credit with balloon payments.

**Source**: Combined analysis using both table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- **Base**: The total home equity lines of credit interest only product for 2012, which is $904 million.
- **Part**: The portion of the interest only product that was due to home equity lines of credit with balloon payments. However, this specific part is not provided in the table.
- **Base**: The total home equity lines of credit interest only product for 2012 is $904 million.
- **Part**: The portion of the interest only product that was due to home equity lines of credit with balloon payments is not directly provided in the table.
- The context mentions that there is approximately $306 million of home equity lines of credit with balloon payments scheduled to end in 2012. However, it does not specify if this entire amount is part of the interest only product.
- From the context, we have $306 million of home equity lines of credit with balloon payments scheduled to end in 2012. We will assume this amount is part of the interest only product unless specified otherwise.
- Percentage of the interest only product due to balloon payments = (Part / Base) * 100
- Percentage = ($306 million / $904 million) * 100
- Percentage = (306 / 904) * 100 ≈ 33.85%
- Base: $904 million (total interest only product for 2012)
- Part: $306 million (assumed portion due to balloon payments)
- Percentage = (306 / 904) * 100 ≈ 33.85%
