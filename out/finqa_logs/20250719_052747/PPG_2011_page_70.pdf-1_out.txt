=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Assuming the same trend as in 2011, what would total stock-based compensation cost be for 2012?

**Calculation**:
1. **Data Extraction**: 
   - Stock-based compensation costs:
     - 2009: $34 million
     - 2010: $52 million
     - 2011: $36 million

2. **Calculate Year-over-Year Changes**:
   - From 2009 to 2010: $52 million - $34 million = $18 million increase
   - From 2010 to 2011: $36 million - $52 million = $16 million decrease

3. **Determine Average Change**: 
   - The average change over the two periods is: ($18 million increase - $16 million decrease) / 2 = $1 million increase on average per year.

4. **Project 2012 Cost**:
   - Assuming the same average trend continues, we add the average change to the 2011 cost: $36 million + $1 million = $37 million.

**Answer**: The projected total stock-based compensation cost for 2012, assuming the same trend as in 2011, would be $37 million.

Answer Echoes:
- 2009: $34 million
- 2010: $52 million
- 2011: $36 million
- From 2009 to 2010: $52 million - $34 million = $18 million increase
- From 2010 to 2011: $36 million - $52 million = $16 million decrease
- The average change over the two periods is: ($18 million increase - $16 million decrease) / 2 = $1 million increase on average per year.
- Assuming the same average trend continues, we add the average change to the 2011 cost: $36 million + $1 million = $37 million.
