=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the percent change in annual long-term debt maturities (excluding lease obligations) and annual cash sinking fund requirements for debt outstanding from 2005 to 2004?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base and Part**:
   - Base (2004 value): $925005
   - Part (2005 value): $540372

2. **Calculate the Change**:
   - Change = Part (2005) - Base (2004)
   - Change = $540372 - $925005 = -$384633

3. **Calculate the Percent Change**:
   - Percent Change = (Change / Base) × 100
   - Percent Change = (-$384633 / $925005) × 100

4. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - Percent Change = -0.4157 × 100
   - Percent Change = -41.57%

**Answer**: The percent change in annual long-term debt maturities and annual cash sinking fund requirements for debt outstanding from 2005 to 2004 is \(-41.57\%\).

**Source**: Table data (as no additional context from text was required for this calculation).

Answer Echoes:
- **Base (2004 value)**: $925,005
- **Part (2005 value)**: $540,372
- Change = Part (2005) - Base (2004)
- Change = $540,372 - $925,005 = -$384,633
- Percent Change = (Change / Base) × 100
- Percent Change = (-$384,633 / $925,005) × 100
- Percent Change = -0.4157 × 100
- Percent Change = -41.57%
- **2004 Value (Base)**: $925,005 (in thousands)
- **2005 Value (Part)**: $540,372 (in thousands)
- No additional context is required for this specific calculation as the table data provides the necessary values.
- Base (2004 value): $925,005
- Part (2005 value): $540,372
- Change = Part (2005) - Base (2004)
- Change = $540,372 - $925,005 = -$384,633
- Percent Change = (Change / Base) × 100
- Percent Change = (-$384,633 / $925,005) × 100
- Percent Change = -0.4157 × 100
- Percent Change = -41.57%
