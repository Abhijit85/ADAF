=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In millions, what is the total impact on the change in net revenue from the reserve equalization, the purchased power capacity, and the transmission revenue?

**Calculation**:
1. Extract values from the table:
   - Reserve equalization: $14.3 million
   - Purchased power capacity: $12.4 million
   - Transmission revenue: $7.0 million

2. Calculate the total impact:
   - Total impact = Reserve equalization + Purchased power capacity + Transmission revenue
   - Total impact = $14.3 million + $12.4 million + $7.0 million

3. Perform the addition:
   - Total impact = $14.3 + $12.4 + $7.0
   - Total impact = $33.7 million

**Answer**: $33.7 million

**Source**: Table data was used to extract the specific numerical values for reserve equalization, purchased power capacity, and transmission revenue. The text context provided additional understanding but did not alter the numerical calculation.

Answer Echoes:
- Reserve equalization: $14.3 million
- Purchased power capacity: $12.4 million
- Transmission revenue: $7.0 million
- Total impact = Reserve equalization + Purchased power capacity + Transmission revenue
- Total impact = $14.3 million + $12.4 million + $7.0 million
- Total impact = $14.3 + $12.4 + $7.0
- Total impact = $33.7 million
- **Arithmetic Type**: Sum
- **Data Requirements**: Specific amounts for reserve equalization, purchased power capacity, and transmission revenue
- **Context Needs**: Understanding of how these components affect net revenue
- **Calculation Steps**: Sum the provided values
- **Reserve Equalization**: $14.3 million
- **Purchased Power Capacity**: $12.4 million
- **Transmission Revenue**: $7.0 million
- The text provides context on why these components impact net revenue, such as changes in agreements and rates, but does not alter the numerical values needed for calculation.
- **Combined Operations**: Sum the extracted values to determine the total impact on net revenue.
- Reserve Equalization: $14.3 million
- Purchased Power Capacity: $12.4 million
- Transmission Revenue: $7.0 million
- Total impact = Reserve Equalization + Purchased Power Capacity + Transmission Revenue
- Total impact = $14.3 million + $12.4 million + $7.0 million
- Total impact = $14.3 + $12.4 + $7.0
- Total impact = $33.7 million
