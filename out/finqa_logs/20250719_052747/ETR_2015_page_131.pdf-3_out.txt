=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the percent change in annual long-term debt maturities from 2018 to 2019?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base**: The base year is 2018, with an amount of $822690 (in thousands).
2. **Identify Part**: The part for comparison is 2019, with an amount of $768588 (in thousands).
3. **Calculate the Change**: 
   - Change = 2019 amount - 2018 amount
   - Change = $768588 - $822690 = -$54102 (in thousands)
4. **Calculate the Percent Change**:
   - Percent Change = (Change / 2018 amount) × 100
   - Percent Change = (-$54102 / $822690) × 100
   - Percent Change ≈ -6.58%

**Answer**: The percent change in annual long-term debt maturities from 2018 to 2019 is approximately -6.58%. This indicates a decrease of approximately 6.58% in annual long-term debt maturities from 2018 to 2019.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Change = 2019 amount - 2018 amount
- Change = $768,588 - $822,690 = -$54,102 (in thousands)
- Percent Change = (Change / 2018 amount) × 100
- Percent Change = (-$54,102 / $822,690) × 100
- Percent Change ≈ -6.58%
- **2018 Long-term Debt Maturities**: $822,690 (in thousands)
- **2019 Long-term Debt Maturities**: $768,588 (in thousands)
- Change = 2019 amount - 2018 amount
- Change = $768,588 - $822,690 = -$54,102 (in thousands)
- Percent Change = (Change / 2018 amount) × 100
- Percent Change = (-$54,102 / $822,690) × 100
- Percent Change ≈ -6.58%
