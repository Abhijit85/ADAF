- The reserve for losses under the commercial mortgage loan recourse obligations was $47 million as of December 31, 2011.
- The reserve for losses under the commercial mortgage loan recourse obligations was $54 million as of December 31, 2010.
- We have two specific figures for the reserve for losses: $47 million for 2011 and $54 million for 2010.
- Since the question asks for the total reserve for losses, we need to consider the most recent figure available, which is $47 million as of December 31, 2011.
- Reserve for losses as of December 31, 2011: $47 million
- Reserve for losses as of December 31, 2010: $54 million
- Use the most recent reserve figure: $47 million
