=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What were the remaining Mondovi net assets acquired following the sale of certain excess assets from the deal, in thousands?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Original Net Assets Acquired**: 
   - Original Net Assets Acquired = $1042661 (in thousands)

2. **Determine the Total Assets Acquired**:
   - Total Assets Acquired = $1848575 (in thousands)

3. **Calculate the Excess Assets Sold**:
   - Excess Assets Sold = Total Assets Acquired - Net Assets Acquired
   - Excess Assets Sold = $1848575 - $1042661
   - Excess Assets Sold = $805914 (in thousands)

4. **Determine the Remaining Net Assets**:
   - Since the net assets acquired already reflect the sale of excess assets, the remaining net assets are the net assets acquired.

**Answer**: The remaining Mondovi net assets acquired following the sale of certain excess assets from the deal are $1042661 (in thousands), or $1042.661K when expressed in thousands.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- From the table, the original net assets acquired are given as $1,042,661.
- Total assets acquired are listed as $1,848,575.
- To find the excess assets sold, we need to determine the difference between the total assets acquired and the net assets acquired. This will give us the value of the assets that were sold off to reach the net assets figure.
- Excess Assets Sold = Total Assets Acquired - Net Assets Acquired
- Excess Assets Sold = $1,848,575 - $1,042,661
- Remaining Net Assets = Net Assets Acquired - Excess Assets Sold
- However, since we are only asked for the remaining net assets after the sale of excess assets, we can directly consider the net assets acquired as the remaining figure after the sale.
- Excess Assets Sold = $1,848,575 - $1,042,661 = $805,914
- From the table data, the original net assets acquired are $1,042,661 (in thousands).
- Total assets acquired are listed as $1,848,575 (in thousands).
- The excess assets sold are calculated by finding the difference between the total assets acquired and the net assets acquired.
- Excess Assets Sold = Total Assets Acquired - Net Assets Acquired
- Excess Assets Sold = $1,848,575 - $1,042,661
- Excess Assets Sold = $805,914 (in thousands)
- Since the question asks for the remaining net assets after the sale of certain excess assets, and the net assets acquired already reflect this sale, the remaining net assets are the net assets acquired.
- Original Net Assets Acquired: $1,042,661 (in thousands)
- Total Assets Acquired: $1,848,575 (in thousands)
- Excess Assets Sold = $1,848,575 - $1,042,661 = $805,914 (in thousands)
