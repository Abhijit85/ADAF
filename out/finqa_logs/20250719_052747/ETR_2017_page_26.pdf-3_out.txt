=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the net change in net revenue during 2016?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the 2015 Net Revenue**: $1666 million
2. **Identify the 2016 Net Revenue**: $1542 million
3. **Calculate the Net Change**: 
   - Net Change = $1542 million - $1666 million
   - Net Change = -$124 million

**Answer**: The net change in net revenue during 2016 is a decrease of $124 million.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context. The table provided the exact figures for 2015 and 2016 net revenues, while the text context explained factors contributing to the decrease, such as lower realized wholesale energy prices and lower capacity prices.

Answer Echoes:
- From the table, the 2015 net revenue is $1,666 million.
- From the table, the 2016 net revenue is $1,542 million.
- The net change in net revenue is calculated by subtracting the 2016 net revenue from the 2015 net revenue.
- **Calculation**: $1,542 million - $1,666 million = -$124 million
- The result is negative, indicating a decrease in net revenue.
- **Arithmetic Type**: Difference
- **Data Requirements**: 2015 and 2016 net revenue figures
- **Context Needs**: Explanation of factors affecting revenue change
- **2015 Net Revenue**: $1,666 million
- **2016 Net Revenue**: $1,542 million
- The text provides context for the decrease in net revenue, mentioning factors such as lower realized wholesale energy prices, lower capacity prices, and other operational changes.
- **Calculation**: Subtract the 2016 net revenue from the 2015 net revenue to find the net change.
- Net Change = $1,542 million - $1,666 million = -$124 million
- 2015 Net Revenue: $1,666 million
- 2016 Net Revenue: $1,542 million
- Net Change = $1,542 million - $1,666 million = -$124 million
