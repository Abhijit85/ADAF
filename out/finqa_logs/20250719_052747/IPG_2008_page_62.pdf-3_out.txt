=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the change in the balance of liability for the restructuring 2003 program from 2006 to 2008, in millions?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Liability at December 31, 2006** for the 2003 Program:
   - From the table: $12.6 million

2. **Identify the Liability at December 31, 2008** for the 2003 Program:
   - From the table: $5.7 million

3. **Calculate the Change in Liability**:
   - Change = Liability at December 31, 2008 - Liability at December 31, 2006
   - Change = $5.7 million - $12.6 million

4. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - Change = $5.7 million - $12.6 million = -$6.9 million

**Answer**: The change in the balance of liability for the restructuring 2003 program from 2006 to 2008 is a decrease of $6.9 million.

**Source**: Table data (most reliable for exact numbers)

Answer Echoes:
- From the table: $12.6 million
- From the table: $5.7 million
- Change = Liability at December 31, 2008 - Liability at December 31, 2006
- Change = $5.7 million - $12.6 million
- Change = $5.7 million - $12.6 million = -$6.9 million
- **From Table**:
- Liability at December 31, 2006 for the 2003 Program: $12.6 million
- Liability at December 31, 2008 for the 2003 Program: $5.7 million
- Change = Liability at December 31, 2008 - Liability at December 31, 2006
- Change = $5.7 million - $12.6 million
- Change = $5.7 million - $12.6 million = -$6.9 million
