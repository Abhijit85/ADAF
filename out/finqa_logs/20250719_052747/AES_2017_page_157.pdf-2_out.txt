=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: As of December 31, 2017, assuming an average price per share of $12.12, what would be the cost in millions to repurchase all the remaining shares in the program?

**Calculation**:
1. **Determine the Number of Shares that Can Be Repurchased**:
   - Remaining Funds for Repurchase: $246 million
   - Average Price per Share: $12.12
   - Formula: Number of Shares = Remaining Funds / Average Price per Share
   - Calculation: Number of Shares = $246 million / $12.12 per share ≈ 20296694 shares

2. **Calculate the Total Cost to Repurchase All Remaining Shares**:
   - Since the remaining funds are exactly what is available for repurchasing shares, the total cost to repurchase these shares is the same as the remaining funds.
   - Total Cost = $246 million

**Answer**: The cost to repurchase all the remaining shares in the program as of December 31, 2017, would be $246 million.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context.

Answer Echoes:
- **Remaining Funds for Repurchase**: $246 million
- **Average Price per Share**: $12.12
- Given the remaining funds of $246 million and an average price per share of $12.12, we can calculate the number of shares that can be repurchased.
- Formula: Number of Shares = Remaining Funds / Average Price per Share
- Calculation: Number of Shares = $246 million / $12.12 per share
- Number of Shares = 246,000,000 / 12.12 ≈ 20,296,694 shares
- Since the remaining funds are exactly what is available for repurchasing shares, the total cost to repurchase these shares is the same as the remaining funds.
- Total Cost = $246 million
- Remaining Funds for Repurchase: $246 million
- Average Price per Share: $12.12
- Number of Shares = $246 million / $12.12 ≈ 20,296,694 shares
- Total Cost = $246 million
