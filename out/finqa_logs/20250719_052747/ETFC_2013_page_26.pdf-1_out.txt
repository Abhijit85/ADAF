=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: At December 31, 2013, what was the percent of square feet of our office in Alpharetta, Georgia not leased?

**Calculation**: 
To calculate the percentage of square feet not leased, we need to know both the total square footage and the amount that was leased. The table provides the total square footage for the Alpharetta location as 254000 square feet. However, neither the table nor the text provides information on how much of this space was leased. Without this critical piece of data, we cannot perform the calculation.

**Answer**: Additional context required. We need the specific amount of square footage that was leased at the Alpharetta office to calculate the percentage of space that was not leased. Without this information, the calculation cannot be completed.

**Source**: Combined analysis (table and text) - both sources lack the necessary leased square footage data.

Answer Echoes:
- Total square footage for the Alpharetta location: 254,000 square feet.
- The text does not provide explicit information about how much of the Alpharetta office space was leased or not leased.
- We need to know the amount of square footage that was actually leased to calculate the percentage that was not leased.
- The table only provides the total square footage (254,000 square feet) but does not specify how much of this space was leased.
- The text context does not provide additional information about the leased portion of the Alpharetta office.
- Without knowing the leased portion, we cannot calculate the percentage of space that was not leased.
- Since we lack the necessary data on the leased portion, we cannot validate or calculate the percentage of unleased space.
