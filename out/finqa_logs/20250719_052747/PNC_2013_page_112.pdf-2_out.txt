=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In these equity investment balances, what is the percent of unfunded commitments at December 31, 2012?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Relevant Data**:
   - Unfunded Commitments at December 31, 2012: $685 million (from text context)
   - Total Equity Investment Balances for relevant categories (tax credit and private equity investments): $4.8 billion (from text context)

2. **Calculate the Percentage of Unfunded Commitments**:
   - Percentage of unfunded commitments = (Unfunded Commitments / Total Equity Investment Balances) × 100
   - Percentage of unfunded commitments = ($685 million / $4800 million) × 100

3. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - Percentage of unfunded commitments = (685 / 4800) × 100 ≈ 14.27%

**Answer**: The percent of unfunded commitments at December 31, 2012, is approximately 14.27%.

**Source**: Combined analysis using text context for unfunded commitments and relevant total equity investment balances.

Answer Echoes:
- **Total Equity Investment Balances at December 31, 2012**: $10,877 million
- **Unfunded Commitments at December 31, 2012**: $685 million
- **Total Equity Investment Balances at December 31, 2012**: $3.0 billion (for tax credit investments) + $1.8 billion (for private equity investments) = $4.8 billion
- **Total Equity Investment Balances at December 31, 2012**: $10,877 million
- The text context provides a total equity investment balance for specific categories (tax credit and private equity investments) which sums to $4.8 billion.
- The table data provides a broader total equity investment balance of $10,877 million.
- Use the total equity investment balance from the text context that includes the categories where unfunded commitments are specified.
- Percentage of unfunded commitments = (Unfunded Commitments / Total Equity Investment Balances) × 100
- Percentage of unfunded commitments = ($685 million / $4,800 million) × 100
- Percentage of unfunded commitments = (685 / 4800) × 100 ≈ 14.27%
