=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the percent of the impairment charges to the net revenue in 2013?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Impairment Charges**: From the text context, we know the impairment charges for 2013 were $240 million.
2. **Identify Net Revenue**: The net revenue for 2013 is not directly provided in the table or text. However, if we assume additional context or data provides the net revenue for 2013, we can proceed with the calculation.
3. **Calculate Percentage**: 
   \[
   \text{Percentage of Impairment Charges} = \left( \frac{\text{Impairment Charges}}{\text{Net Revenue}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Assuming the net revenue for 2013 is provided as $X million, the calculation would be:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of Impairment Charges} = \left( \frac{240}{X} \right) \times 100
   \]

**Answer**: Without the specific net revenue figure for 2013, the percentage of impairment charges to net revenue cannot be calculated. Additional information on the net revenue for 2013 is necessary to determine this percentage.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context and assumed additional data for net revenue.

Answer Echoes:
- **Impairment Charges**: The text states that "restructuring and asset impairment charges of $240 million for 2013."
- **Revenue Change**: The text mentions that "revenue for 2013 was down 1% from 2012," but does not provide the exact revenue figures for 2013.
- The table data does not explicitly provide the net revenue for 2013. Therefore, we cannot directly extract this information from the table.
