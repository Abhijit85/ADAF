=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: As part of the employee stock purchase plan, what was the percent of the decline in issuance under this plan from 2016 to 2017?

**Calculation**:
1. **Extract Issuance Data**:
   - 2016 Issuance: 130085 shares
   - 2017 Issuance: 113941 shares

2. **Calculate the Change in Issuance**:
   \[
   \text{Change in Issuance} = \text{Issuance in 2017} - \text{Issuance in 2016} = 113941 - 130085 = -16144 \text{ shares}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Percentage Decline**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Decline} = \left(\frac{\text{Change in Issuance}}{\text{Issuance in 2016}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{-16144}{130085}\right) \times 100
   \]

4. **Perform the Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Decline} = \left(\frac{-16144}{130085}\right) \times 100 \approx -12.41\%
   \]

**Answer**: The issuance under the employee stock purchase plan declined by approximately 12.41% from 2016 to 2017.

**Source**: Combined analysis using text context for issuance data.

Answer Echoes:
- 2016: 8.4 million shares
- 2017: 9.6 million shares
- **2016 Issuance**: 130,085 shares
- **2017 Issuance**: 113,941 shares
