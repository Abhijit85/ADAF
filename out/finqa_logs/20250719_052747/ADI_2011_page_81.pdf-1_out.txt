=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What portion of the total investment is allocated to mutual funds in 2011?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base**: Total Deferred Compensation Plan investments in 2011 = $26410
2. **Identify Part**: Amount allocated to mutual funds in 2011 = $9223
3. **Calculate Percentage**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Mutual funds}}{\text{Total investments}}\right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{9223}{26410}\right) \times 100
   \]
4. **Perform the Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = 0.3491 \times 100 = 34.91\%
   \]

**Answer**: 34.91% of the total investment is allocated to mutual funds in 2011.

**Source**: Table data was used for the calculation, as it provided the exact figures needed for determining the percentage allocation.

Answer Echoes:
- From the table: Total Deferred Compensation Plan investments in 2011 = $26,410
- From the table: Mutual funds in 2011 = $9,223
- Total Deferred Compensation Plan investments in 2011: $26,410
- Amount allocated to mutual funds in 2011: $9,223
- No additional context from the text is needed for this specific calculation.
- Total investments in 2011: $26,410
- Mutual funds in 2011: $9,223
- Calculate the percentage of total investments allocated to mutual funds: \((9,223 / 26,410) \times 100 = 34.91\%\)
