=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the total of U.S. dollar notes issued in 2014, in millions?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify U.S. Dollar Notes Issued in 2014**:
   - $500 issued in November 2014
   - $750 issued in November 2014
   - $750 issued in November 2014

2. **Sum the Face Values**:
   - $500 + $750 + $750 = $2000

3. **Convert to Millions**:
   - $2000 / 1000 = $2 million

**Answer**: $2 million

**Source**: Combined analysis from table and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- From the table, the U.S. dollar notes issued in 2014 are:
- $500 issued in November 2014
- $750 issued in November 2014
- $750 issued in November 2014
- Add the face values of these notes:
- $500 + $750 + $750 = $2,000
- Since the question asks for the total in millions, convert $2,000 to millions:
- $2,000 / 1,000 = $2 million
- $500 issued in November 2014
- $750 issued in November 2014
- $750 issued in November 2014
- Add the face values of these notes:
- $500 + $750 + $750 = $2,000
- Since the question asks for the total in millions, convert $2,000 to millions:
- $2,000 / 1,000 = $2 million
