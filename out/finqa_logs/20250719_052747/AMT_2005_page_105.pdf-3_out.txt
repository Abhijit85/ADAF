=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the percentage of the anticipated approximate tax refund in 2003 based on the NOL of $90.0 million?

**Calculation**:
1. **Initial Anticipated Refund Percentage**:
   - The company initially anticipated receiving $90.0 million from a $380.0 million NOL carryback.
   - Calculate the initial anticipated refund percentage:
   \[
   \frac{90.0 \, \text{million}}{380.0 \, \text{million}} \times 100 = 23.68\%
   \]

2. **Revised Anticipated Refund Percentage**:
   - The revised anticipated refund was $65.0 million.
   - Calculate the revised refund percentage:
   \[
   \frac{65.0 \, \text{million}}{380.0 \, \text{million}} \times 100 = 17.11\%
   \]

**Answer**: The initial anticipated percentage of the tax refund in 2003 based on the NOL of $90.0 million was approximately **23.68%**. However, the revised anticipated refund percentage was approximately **17.11%**.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context.

Answer Echoes:
- The company initially anticipated receiving approximately $90.0 million as a tax refund from the carryback of $380.0 million of net operating losses generated prior to 2003.
- The company revised its estimate and anticipated receiving a refund of approximately $65.0 million.
- The company expected to receive $90.0 million from a $380.0 million NOL carryback.
- Calculate the initial anticipated refund percentage: \((90.0 \, \text{million} / 380.0 \, \text{million}) \times 100\).
- The revised anticipated refund was $65.0 million.
- Calculate the revised refund percentage: \((65.0 \, \text{million} / 380.0 \, \text{million}) \times 100\).
