=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Accrued interest represented how much of the ending balance in uncertain tax benefits as of December 31, 2014?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Required Data**:
   - Ending balance of uncertain tax benefits for 2014: $2.2 billion
   - Accrued interest for 2014: $258 million

2. **Convert Units for Consistency**:
   - Convert $2.2 billion to $2200 million

3. **Calculate Composition Percentage**:
   - Formula: (Accrued Interest / Ending Balance of Uncertain Tax Benefits) × 100
   - Calculation: ($258 million / $2200 million) × 100 = 11.73%

**Answer**: Accrued interest represented approximately 11.73% of the ending balance in uncertain tax benefits as of December 31, 2014.

**Source**: Combined analysis using text context for data extraction.

Answer Echoes:
- **Arithmetic Type**: Composition percentage
- **Data Requirements**: Ending balance of uncertain tax benefits, accrued interest amount
- **Context Needs**: Additional information from text for accrued interest
- **Calculation Steps**: Determine the percentage of accrued interest in the ending balance
- **Ending Balance of Uncertain Tax Benefits (2014)**: $2.2 billion
- **Accrued Interest (2014)**: $258 million
- **Formula**: (Accrued Interest / Ending Balance of Uncertain Tax Benefits) × 100
- **Calculation**: ($258 million / $2.2 billion) × 100
- Ending balance of uncertain tax benefits for 2014: $2.2 billion
- Accrued interest for 2014: $258 million
- Extracted the necessary values from the provided text context.
- Convert $2.2 billion to $2,200 million for consistency in units.
- Calculate the percentage: ($258 million / $2,200 million) × 100 = 11.73%
- The calculation is consistent with the provided data and context.
- Present the result with appropriate precision.
- Ending Balance of Uncertain Tax Benefits (2014): $2.2 billion
- Accrued Interest (2014): $258 million
- ($258 million / $2,200 million) × 100 = 11.73%
