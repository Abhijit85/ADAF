=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the percent of the total contractual obligations for future payments for total debt in 2005?

**Calculation**: 
Given the lack of specific numerical data for 2005 in both the table and the text, we cannot perform a direct calculation. However, if the data were available, the calculation would involve the following steps:

1. **Identify Required Data**: 
   - Total contractual obligations for 2005
   - Total debt for 2005

2. **Perform Calculations**:
   - Calculate the percentage: \((\text{Total Debt for 2005} / \text{Total Contractual Obligations for 2005}) \times 100\)

**Answer**: Unable to calculate due to the absence of specific financial figures for total contractual obligations and total debt for the year 2005.

**Source**: Combined analysis of table and text context, with a conclusion that additional data is required for calculation.

Answer Echoes:
- **Base**: Total contractual obligations for future payments in 2005.
- **Part**: Total debt for future payments in 2005.
- **Arithmetic Type**: Percentage calculation
- **Data Requirements**: Total contractual obligations for 2005, total debt for 2005
- **Context Needs**: Any additional information on 2005 obligations and debt
- The table does not provide data for 2005, only for future years starting from 2006.
- The text mentions contractual obligations related to purchase commitments and debt but does not specify amounts for 2005.
- It also discusses the company's strategic plans and accounting policies but does not provide specific financial figures for 2005.
- Total contractual obligations for 2005
- Total debt for 2005
- Calculate the percentage: \((\text{Total Debt for 2005} / \text{Total Contractual Obligations for 2005}) \times 100\)
