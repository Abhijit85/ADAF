=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What percentage of total market risk for positions, accounted for at fair value, that are not included in VaR is comprised of equity in 2016?

**Calculation**: 
Given the information provided, we are unable to perform a direct calculation because the necessary data on market risk for equity positions not included in VaR for 2016 is not available in the table or text context. Specifically, we need:
1. The total market risk for positions not included in VaR.
2. The portion of this market risk attributed to equity in 2016.

Without these specific figures, we cannot calculate the percentage of total market risk comprised of equity.

**Answer**: Unable to calculate the percentage without additional numerical data on market risk for equity positions not included in VaR for 2016.

**Source**: Combined analysis of table and text context, which both lack the necessary specific data.

Answer Echoes:
- **Arithmetic Type**: Composition Percentage
- **Data Requirements**: Total market risk for positions not included in VaR and the portion attributed to equity in 2016.
- **Context Needs**: Information on market risk for equity positions not included in VaR for 2016.
