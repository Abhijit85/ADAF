=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What percentage of the total purchase price is represented by goodwill?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Goodwill**: From the text context, goodwill is explicitly stated as $3.4 million.
2. **Identify Total Purchase Price**: From the table data, the total purchase price is given as $15.704 million.
3. **Calculate Percentage of Goodwill**:
   - Formula: (Goodwill / Total Purchase Price) × 100
   - Calculation: ($3.4 million / $15.704 million) × 100
   - Perform the Calculation: ($3.4 / $15.704) × 100 = 21.64%

**Answer**: 21.64% of the total purchase price is represented by goodwill.

**Source**: Combined analysis (using both table data and text context)

Answer Echoes:
- Cash paid + Prior investment in HPL + Acquisition-related costs
- $11,001 + $1,872 + $2,831 = $15,704 thousand
- Total purchase price - Identifiable assets
- $15,704 - $15,704 = $0 thousand
- (Goodwill / Total purchase price) × 100
- (0 / 15,704) × 100 = 0%
- **Goodwill**: $3.4 million
- **Total Purchase Price**: $15,704 thousand (or $15.704 million)
- From the text, goodwill is explicitly stated as $3.4 million.
- From the table data, the total purchase price is given as $15.704 million.
- Formula: (Goodwill / Total Purchase Price) × 100
- Calculation: ($3.4 million / $15.704 million) × 100
- ($3.4 / $15.704) × 100 = 21.64%
- Goodwill: $3.4 million (from text)
- Total Purchase Price: $15.704 million (from table)
- (3.4 / 15.704) × 100 = 21.64%
