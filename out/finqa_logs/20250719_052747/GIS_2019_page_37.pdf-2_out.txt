=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In 2019, what was the percent of the total future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations associated with long-term debt that was due in 2020?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Base**: The total future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations associated with long-term debt is $13093.0 million.
2. **Identify the Part**: The portion of the long-term debt that is due in 2020 is $1396.3 million.
3. **Calculate the Percentage**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1396.3}{13093.0} \right) \times 100
   \]
4. **Perform the Calculation**:
   \[
   \frac{1396.3}{13093.0} \approx 0.1066
   \]
   \[
   0.1066 \times 100 = 10.66\%
   \]

**Answer**: 10.66%

**Source**: Table data (as the necessary information was extracted from the table, and no additional context from the text was required for this specific calculation).

Answer Echoes:
- **Total Long-term Debt**: $13,093.0 million
- **Long-term Debt Due in 2020**: $1,396.3 million
- **Total Long-term Debt**: $13,093.0 million
- **Long-term Debt Due in 2020**: $1,396.3 million
- No additional context from the text is required for this specific calculation as the necessary data is already extracted from the table.
- The base is the total future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations associated with long-term debt, which is $13,093.0 million.
- The part we are interested in is the portion of the long-term debt that is due in 2020, which is $1,396.3 million.
- Use the formula for percentage:
