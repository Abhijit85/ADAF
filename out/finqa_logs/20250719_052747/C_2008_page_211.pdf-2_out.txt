=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In 2008, what was the carrying amount reported on the consolidated balance sheet to aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of fair value of the trading assets?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Components**:
   - **Carrying Amount (2008, Trading Assets)**: $16254 million
   - **Aggregate Unpaid Principal Balance in Excess of Fair Value (2008, Trading Assets)**: $6501 million

2. **Calculate Ratio**:
   - Ratio = Carrying Amount / Aggregate Unpaid Principal Balance in Excess of Fair Value
   - Ratio = $16254 / $6501

3. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - Ratio = 2.500769

4. **Format Result**:
   - The ratio is approximately 2.50 when rounded to two decimal places.

**Answer**: The ratio of the carrying amount reported on the consolidated balance sheet to the aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of fair value for trading assets in 2008 is approximately 2.50.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data.

Answer Echoes:
- **Carrying Amount (2008, Trading Assets)**: $16,254 million
- **Aggregate Unpaid Principal Balance in Excess of Fair Value (2008, Trading Assets)**: $6,501 million
- Carrying Amount: $16,254 million
- Aggregate Unpaid Principal Balance in Excess of Fair Value: $6,501 million
- Ratio = Carrying Amount / Aggregate Unpaid Principal Balance in Excess of Fair Value
- Ratio = $16,254 / $6,501
- Ratio = 2.500769
- The ratio is approximately 2.50 (rounded to two decimal places).
- **Carrying Amount (2008, Trading Assets)**: $16,254 million
- **Aggregate Unpaid Principal Balance in Excess of Fair Value (2008, Trading Assets)**: $6,501 million
- We need the carrying amount and the aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of fair value for trading assets in 2008.
- Carrying Amount: $16,254 million
- Aggregate Unpaid Principal Balance in Excess of Fair Value: $6,501 million
- Calculate the ratio of the carrying amount to the aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of fair value.
- Ratio = Carrying Amount / Aggregate Unpaid Principal Balance in Excess of Fair Value
- Ratio = $16,254 / $6,501
- Ratio = 2.500769
- The ratio is approximately 2.50 when rounded to two decimal places.
- Carrying Amount: $16,254 million
- Aggregate Unpaid Principal Balance in Excess of Fair Value: $6,501 million
- Ratio = $16,254 / $6,501 = 2.500769
- The ratio of the carrying amount reported on the consolidated balance sheet to the aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of fair value for trading assets in 2008 is approximately 2.50.
