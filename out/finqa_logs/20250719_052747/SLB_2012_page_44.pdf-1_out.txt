=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: As of December 31, 2012, what was the outstanding amount of share repurchase authorized in billions?

**Calculation**:
1. **Total Authorized Amount**: $8 billion (as approved by the Schlumberger board of directors on April 17, 2008).
2. **Total Amount Spent on Repurchases as of December 31, 2012**: $7.12 billion.
3. **Outstanding Amount Calculation**:
   - Outstanding amount = Total authorized amount - Total amount spent
   - Outstanding amount = $8 billion - $7.12 billion
   - Outstanding amount = $0.88 billion

**Answer**: As of December 31, 2012, the outstanding amount of share repurchase authorized was $0.88 billion.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context (for total authorized amount and total spent).

Answer Echoes:
- **Arithmetic Type**: Difference
- **Data Requirements**: Total authorized amount for share repurchases and total amount spent on repurchases up to December 31, 2012.
- **Context Needs**: Total authorized amount for the share repurchase program.
- **Total Authorized Amount**: The text states that the Schlumberger board of directors approved an $8 billion share repurchase program on April 17, 2008.
- **Total Amount Spent**: As of December 31, 2012, Schlumberger had repurchased $7.12 billion of shares under this program.
- **Outstanding Amount**: Calculate the difference between the total authorized amount and the total amount spent on repurchases.
- Total authorized amount for share repurchases: $8 billion.
- Total amount spent on repurchases as of December 31, 2012: $7.12 billion.
- Outstanding amount = Total authorized amount - Total amount spent
- Outstanding amount = $8 billion - $7.12 billion
