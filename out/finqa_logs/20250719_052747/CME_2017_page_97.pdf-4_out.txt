=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: How many total votes can the Class B-3 provide in 2017?

**Calculation**: 
To determine the total votes that Class B-3 can provide in 2017, we need two key pieces of information:
1. The voting rights per share for Class B-3.
2. The number of Class B-3 shares outstanding in 2017.

From the text context, we know that each share of Class B-3 common stock has one vote. However, the number of Class B-3 shares outstanding in 2017 is not provided in the table or text context. Without this information, we cannot calculate the total votes.

If the number of Class B-3 shares outstanding were provided, the calculation would be:
\[
\text{Total Votes from Class B-3} = \text{Number of Class B-3 Shares} \times 1 \text{ vote per share}
\]

**Answer**: Additional context required. The number of Class B-3 shares outstanding in 2017 is needed to calculate the total votes. Without this information, the calculation cannot be completed.

**Source**: Combined analysis (text for voting rights, table for share count which is missing).

Answer Echoes:
- **Voting Rights per Share for Class B-3**: The text specifies that each share of Class B-3 common stock has one vote on matters relating to core rights.
- The table does not provide the number of Class B-3 shares outstanding in 2017, which is necessary to calculate the total votes.
- To calculate the total votes that Class B-3 can provide in 2017, we need the number of Class B-3 shares outstanding in that year. This information is not provided in the given table or text context.
- If the number of Class B-3 shares outstanding were known, the calculation would be straightforward:
- **Additional Context Required**: The number of Class B-3 shares outstanding in 2017 is needed to calculate the total votes. Without this information, the calculation cannot be completed.
