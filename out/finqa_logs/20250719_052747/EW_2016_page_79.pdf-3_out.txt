=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the current ratio?

**Calculation**: 
1. Identify Current Assets: $28.1 million
2. Identify Current Liabilities: $32.9 million
3. Use the formula for the current ratio:
   \[
   \text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
   \]
4. Substitute the values:
   \[
   \text{Current Ratio} = \frac{28.1}{32.9}
   \]
5. Perform the division:
   \[
   \text{Current Ratio} = 0.8541
   \]

**Answer**: The current ratio is 0.8541.

**Source**: Table data (Current Assets and Current Liabilities)

Answer Echoes:
- **Arithmetic Type**: Ratio
- **Data Requirements**: Current assets and current liabilities
- **Context Needs**: Understanding of what the current ratio represents
- No additional context is needed from the text for this calculation.
- **Current Ratio**: A measure of a company's ability to cover its short-term obligations with its short-term assets.
- Current Assets = $28.1 million
- Current Liabilities = $32.9 million
- These values are directly extracted from the table data provided.
- Use the formula for the current ratio:
- Substituting the values:
- Perform the division:
- The result of 0.8541 indicates that the company has $0.8541 in current assets for every $1 of current liabilities, which is a reasonable measure of liquidity.
- Present the result with appropriate precision.
- Current Assets = $28.1 million
- Current Liabilities = $32.9 million
- \(\frac{28.1}{32.9} = 0.8541\)
- The current ratio is 0.8541.
