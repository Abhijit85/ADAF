=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the difference in operating profit margins as adjusted between 2016 and 2017?

**Calculation**:
1. Identify the operating profit margins as adjusted for each year:
   - 2016: 15.1%
   - 2017: 15.7%
2. Calculate the difference:
   - Difference = Operating profit margin (2017) - Operating profit margin (2016)
   - Difference = 15.7% - 15.1%
   - Difference = 0.6%

**Answer**: 0.6%

**Source**: Table data was used to extract the operating profit margins for 2016 and 2017, ensuring the accuracy of the numerical values. The calculation was straightforward, involving a simple subtraction to find the difference in percentages.

Answer Echoes:
- Operating profit margin as adjusted for 2016: 15.1%
- Operating profit margin as adjusted for 2017: 15.7%
- Difference = Operating profit margin (2017) - Operating profit margin (2016)
- Difference = 15.7% - 15.1%
- Difference = 0.6%
- The difference in operating profit margins as adjusted between 2016 and 2017 is 0.6%.
- Operating profit margin as adjusted for 2016: 15.1%
- Operating profit margin as adjusted for 2017: 15.7%
- Difference = Operating profit margin (2017) - Operating profit margin (2016)
- Difference = 15.7% - 15.1%
- Difference = 0.6%
- The difference in operating profit margins as adjusted between 2016 and 2017 is 0.6%.
