=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: By what percentage can CME increase their current line of credit?

**Calculation**:
1. **Determine the Increase in Line of Credit**:
   - Current line of credit: $5.0 billion
   - New line of credit amount: $7.0 billion
   - Increase in line of credit = New amount - Current amount = $7.0 billion - $5.0 billion = $2.0 billion

2. **Calculate the Percentage Increase**:
   - Percentage increase = (Increase / Current amount) * 100
   - Percentage increase = ($2.0 billion / $5.0 billion) * 100 = 40%

**Answer**: CME can increase their current line of credit by 40%.

**Source**: Combined analysis using text context for current and potential line of credit amounts.

Answer Echoes:
- Designated corporate contributions for futures and options: $100.0 million
- Guaranty fund contributions: $2,899.5 million
- Assessment powers: $7,973.6 million
- Minimum Total Assets Available for Default: $10,973.1 million
- Current line of credit: $5.0 billion
- Option to increase the line of credit to: $7.0 billion
- New line of credit amount: $7.0 billion
- Current line of credit amount: $5.0 billion
- Increase in line of credit = New amount - Current amount = $7.0 billion - $5.0 billion = $2.0 billion
- Percentage increase = (Increase / Current amount) * 100
- Percentage increase = ($2.0 billion / $5.0 billion) * 100 = 40%
