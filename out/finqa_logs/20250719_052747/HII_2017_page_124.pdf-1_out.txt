=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What portion of the equity compensation plan approved by security holders is to be issued upon the exercise of options, warrants, and rights?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Base**: The total number of securities available for issuance under the equity compensation plan approved by security holders is 4087587.
2. **Identify the Part**: The number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants, and rights is 448859.
3. **Calculate the Percentage**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Base}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{448859}{4087587}\right) \times 100
   \]
4. **Perform the Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{448859}{4087587}\right) \times 100 \approx 10.98\%
   \]

**Answer**: 10.98% of the equity compensation plan approved by security holders is to be issued upon the exercise of options, warrants, and rights.

**Source**: Table data was used for this calculation, as it provided the necessary numerical values for the total securities available and those to be issued.

Answer Echoes:
- **Total number of securities available for issuance under the equity compensation plan approved by security holders**: 4,087,587
- **Number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants, and rights**: 448,859
- No additional context is needed from the text as the table provides all necessary data for this calculation.
- Total securities available: 4,087,587
- Securities to be issued: 448,859
- Percentage = (448,859 / 4,087,587) × 100 ≈ 10.98%
