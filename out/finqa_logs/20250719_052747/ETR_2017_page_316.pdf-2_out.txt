=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What percent increase in net income was experienced between 2015 and 2016?

**Calculation**:
To calculate the percentage increase in net income from 2015 to 2016, we need the net income figures for both years. The text context provides the information that net income increased by $92.9 million from 2015 to 2016. However, the exact net income for 2015 is not provided.

Let's denote:
- \( NI_{2015} \) as the net income for 2015
- \( NI_{2016} = NI_{2015} + 92.9 \) million

The formula for percentage increase is:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{NI_{2016} - NI_{2015}}{NI_{2015}} \right) \times 100\% \]

Substituting the known increase:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{92.9}{NI_{2015}} \right) \times 100\% \]

**Answer**: To determine the exact percentage increase, we need the net income for 2015 (\( NI_{2015} \)). Without this information, the percentage increase cannot be calculated.

**Source**: Text context (additional data required for completion)

Answer Echoes:
- Net income increased by $92.9 million from 2015 to 2016.
