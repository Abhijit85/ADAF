=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the growth rate in total shipment volume from 2011 to 2012?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Base (Previous Year Value)**:
   - Total shipment volume for 2011: 734.6 million

2. **Identify the Current Year Value**:
   - Total shipment volume for 2012: 763.3 million

3. **Calculate the Growth**:
   - Growth = Current Year Value - Previous Year Value
   - Growth = 763.3 million - 734.6 million = 28.7 million

4. **Calculate the Growth Rate**:
   - Growth Rate = (Growth / Previous Year Value) × 100
   - Growth Rate = (28.7 million / 734.6 million) × 100

5. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - Growth Rate = 0.03907 × 100
   - Growth Rate ≈ 3.91%

**Answer**: The growth rate in total shipment volume from 2011 to 2012 is approximately 3.91%.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Total shipment volume for 2011: 734.6 million
- Total shipment volume for 2012: 763.3 million
- Growth = Current Year Value - Previous Year Value
- Growth = 763.3 - 734.6 = 28.7 million
- Growth Rate = (Growth / Previous Year Value) × 100
- Growth Rate = (28.7 / 734.6) × 100
- Growth Rate = 0.03907 × 100
- Growth Rate ≈ 3.91%
- From the table data provided:
- **2011 Total Shipment Volume**: 734.6 million
- **2012 Total Shipment Volume**: 763.3 million
- Total shipment volume for 2011: 734.6 million
- Total shipment volume for 2012: 763.3 million
- Growth = Current Year Value - Previous Year Value
- Growth = 763.3 million - 734.6 million = 28.7 million
- Growth Rate = (Growth / Previous Year Value) × 100
- Growth Rate = (28.7 million / 734.6 million) × 100
- Growth Rate = 0.03907 × 100
- Growth Rate ≈ 3.91%
