=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the percentage change in the weighted average discount rate for postretirement plans from 2017 to 2018?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Values**:
   - Discount rate for postretirement plans in 2017: 3.79%
   - Discount rate for postretirement plans in 2018: 3.97%

2. **Calculate the Change**:
   - Change = 2018 rate - 2017 rate
   - Change = 3.97% - 3.79% = 0.18%

3. **Calculate the Percentage Change**:
   - Percentage Change = (Change / 2017 rate) × 100
   - Percentage Change = (0.18% / 3.79%) × 100

4. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - Percentage Change = (0.18 / 3.79) × 100 ≈ 4.75%

**Answer**: The percentage change in the weighted average discount rate for postretirement plans from 2017 to 2018 is approximately 4.75%.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Discount rate for postretirement plans in 2017: 3.79%
- Discount rate for postretirement plans in 2018: 3.97%
- Change = 2018 rate - 2017 rate
- Change = 3.97% - 3.79% = 0.18%
- Percentage Change = (Change / 2017 rate) × 100
- Percentage Change = (0.18% / 3.79%) × 100
- Percentage Change = (0.18 / 3.79) × 100 ≈ 4.75%
- **Discount rate for postretirement plans in 2017**: 3.79%
- **Discount rate for postretirement plans in 2018**: 3.97%
- Change = 2018 rate - 2017 rate
- Change = 3.97% - 3.79% = 0.18%
- Percentage Change = (Change / 2017 rate) × 100
- Percentage Change = (0.18% / 3.79%) × 100
- Percentage Change = (0.18 / 3.79) × 100 ≈ 4.75%
