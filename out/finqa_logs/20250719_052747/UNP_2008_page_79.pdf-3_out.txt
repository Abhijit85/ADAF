=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the percentage difference in sold receivables from 2007 to 2008?

**Calculation**:
1. **Extract Data**:
   - 2007 sold receivables: $600 million
   - 2008 sold receivables: $584 million

2. **Calculate the Difference**:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Value in 2008} - \text{Value in 2007} = 584 \, \text{million} - 600 \, \text{million} = -16 \, \text{million}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Percentage Difference**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Difference} = \left( \frac{\text{Difference}}{\text{Value in 2007}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{-16}{600} \right) \times 100
   \]

4. **Perform the Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Difference} = \left( -0.0267 \right) \times 100 = -2.67\%
   \]

**Answer**: The percentage difference in sold receivables from 2007 to 2008 is \(-2.67\%\).

**Source**: Combined analysis using text context for data extraction.

Answer Echoes:
