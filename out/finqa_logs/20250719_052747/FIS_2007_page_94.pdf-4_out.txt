=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What percentage of total future minimum operating lease payments for leases with remaining terms greater than one year are due in 2010?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base and Part**:
   - **Base**: Total future minimum operating lease payments for leases with remaining terms greater than one year (2010 onwards) = $102596
   - **Part**: Payments due in 2010 = $35269

2. **Calculate Percentage**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Base}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{35269}{102596}\right) \times 100
   \]

3. **Perform Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{35269}{102596}\right) \times 100 \approx 34.38\%
   \]

**Answer**: 34.38%

**Source**: Table data (payments due in 2010 and total future minimum operating lease payments for leases with remaining terms greater than one year).

Answer Echoes:
- **Base**: Total future minimum operating lease payments for leases with remaining terms greater than one year.
- **Part**: Payments due in 2010.
- 2008: 83,382
- 2009: 63,060
- 2010: 35,269
- 2011: 21,598
- 2012: 14,860
- Thereafter: 30,869
- Total: $249,038
- Payments from 2010 onwards = 35,269 (2010) + 21,598 (2011) + 14,860 (2012) + 30,869 (Thereafter)
- Total for relevant years = 35,269 + 21,598 + 14,860 + 30,869 = 102,596
- **Part**: Payments due in 2010 = 35,269
- **Base**: Total payments from 2010 onwards = 102,596
- Payments due in 2010: $35,269
- Total future minimum operating lease payments for leases with remaining terms greater than one year (2010 onwards): $102,596
- No additional context from the text is needed for this specific calculation as the table data provides all necessary figures.
- **Base**: Total future minimum operating lease payments for leases with remaining terms greater than one year = $102,596
- **Part**: Payments due in 2010 = $35,269
