=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In 2014, what percentage of the total amortization amount was from intangibles?

**Calculation**:
1. **Amortization from Intangibles for 2014**: $36 million (as provided in the text context).
2. **Total Amortization Amount for 2014**: This information is not provided in the table or text. Without this, we cannot proceed with the calculation.

**Answer**: Unable to calculate the percentage of the total amortization amount from intangibles for 2014 due to missing data on the total amortization amount for that year.

**Source**: Text context (for amortization from intangibles); additional data required for total amortization amount.

Answer Echoes:
- **Total Amortization Amount for 2014**: This includes all amortization expenses, not just those from intangibles.
- **Amortization from Intangibles for 2014**: This is specifically the amortization expense related to intangible assets.
- **Amortization from Intangibles for 2014**: The text states that the amortization expense for intangibles was approximately $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.
