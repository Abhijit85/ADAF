=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the ratio of the acquisition-related costs recognized in 2015 to 2014?

**Calculation**:
1. **Extract Data from Text Context**:
   - 2015 Acquisition-related Costs:
     - Endomondo: $0.6 million
     - MyFitnessPal: $5.7 million
     - Total for 2015: $0.6 million + $5.7 million = $6.3 million
   - 2014 Acquisition-related Costs:
     - Endomondo: $0.8 million

2. **Calculate the Ratio**:
   \[
   \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{2015 Acquisition-related Costs}}{\text{2014 Acquisition-related Costs}} = \frac{6.3}{0.8}
   \]

3. **Perform the Division**:
   \[
   \text{Ratio} = 7.875
   \]

**Answer**: The ratio of the acquisition-related costs recognized in 2015 to 2014 is 7.875.

**Source**: Combined analysis using text context for data extraction.

Answer Echoes:
- **2015 Acquisition-related Costs**: Not provided in the table.
- **2014 Acquisition-related Costs**: Not provided in the table.
- **2015 Acquisition-related Costs**:
- Endomondo: $0.6 million
- MyFitnessPal: $5.7 million
- Total for 2015: $0.6 million + $5.7 million = $6.3 million
- **2014 Acquisition-related Costs**:
- Endomondo: $0.8 million
- 2015: $6.3 million
- 2014: $0.8 million
- 2015 Acquisition-related Costs: $6.3 million (from Endomondo and MyFitnessPal)
- 2014 Acquisition-related Costs: $0.8 million (from Endomondo)
- Ratio = \( \frac{6.3}{0.8} = 7.875 \)
