=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In 2002, what was the ratio of the annual cash sinking fund requirements for debt outstanding that was due in 2004 to 2005?

**Calculation**:
1. **Extract Required Data**:
   - 2004 Requirement: $925005
   - 2005 Requirement: $540372

2. **Perform the Division**:
   \[
   \text{Ratio} = \frac{925005}{540372} \approx 1.711
   \]

**Answer**: 1.711

**Source**: Table data

This calculation shows that the annual cash sinking fund requirement for debt outstanding due in 2004 was approximately 1.711 times that of the requirement due in 2005.

Answer Echoes:
- **2004 Requirement**: $925,005
- **2005 Requirement**: $540,372
- From the table, we have:
- 2004: $925,005
- 2005: $540,372
- The ratio of the 2004 requirement to the 2005 requirement is calculated as follows:
- Calculate the division:
- **Arithmetic Type**: Ratio
- **Data Requirements**: Annual cash sinking fund requirements for 2004 and 2005
- **Context Needs**: None beyond the table data
- **Calculation Steps**: Simple division to find the ratio
- **2004 Requirement**: $925,005
- **2005 Requirement**: $540,372
- Calculate the ratio of the 2004 requirement to the 2005 requirement using the formula:
- 2004 Requirement: $925,005
- 2005 Requirement: $540,372
- The calculation is straightforward and the result seems reasonable given the numbers.
- Present the result with appropriate precision.
- 2004 Requirement: $925,005
- 2005 Requirement: $540,372
- \(\frac{925,005}{540,372} \approx 1.711\)
