=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Purchase commitments (in thousands) totaled what for 2010 and 2011?

**Calculation**:
1. Extract values from the table:
   - 2010 Purchase Commitments: $6951 (in thousands)
   - 2011 Purchase Commitments: $5942 (in thousands)

2. Perform the sum calculation:
   - Total for 2010 and 2011 = 6951 + 5942

3. Calculate the sum:
   - 6951 + 5942 = 12893

**Answer**: $12893 (in thousands)

**Source**: Table data was used for the exact numerical values, and the text context was reviewed to ensure no additional numerical data was provided for 2010 and 2011. The calculation was verified for mathematical accuracy and completeness.

Answer Echoes:
- 2010 Purchase Commitments: $6,951 (in thousands)
- 2011 Purchase Commitments: $5,942 (in thousands)
- Total for 2010 and 2011 = 6,951 + 5,942
- 6,951 + 5,942 = 12,893
- 2010 Purchase Commitments: $6,951 (in thousands)
- 2011 Purchase Commitments: $5,942 (in thousands)
- The text context provides background on purchase commitments but does not specify additional numerical data for 2010 and 2011 beyond what is in the table.
- Add the purchase commitments for 2010 and 2011.
- Calculation: \( 6,951 + 5,942 = 12,893 \)
- 2010 Purchase Commitments: $6,951 (in thousands)
- 2011 Purchase Commitments: $5,942 (in thousands)
- \( 6,951 + 5,942 = 12,893 \)
