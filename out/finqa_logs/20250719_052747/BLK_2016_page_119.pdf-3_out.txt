**Calculation**:
1. **6.25% Notes due 2017**:
   - Fair Value: $724 million
   - Carrying Value: $700 million
   - Difference: $724 - $700 = $24 million

2. **5.00% Notes due 2019**:
   - Fair Value: $1086 million
   - Carrying Value: $997 million
   - Difference: $1086 - $997 = $89 million

3. **4.25% Notes due 2021**:
   - Fair Value: $808 million
   - Carrying Value: $746 million
   - Difference: $808 - $746 = $62 million

4. **3.375% Notes due 2022**:
   - Fair Value: $775 million
   - Carrying Value: $746 million
   - Difference: $775 - $746 = $29 million

5. **3.50% Notes due 2024**:
   - Fair Value: $1030 million
   - Carrying Value: $994 million
   - Difference: $1030 - $994 = $36 million

6. **1.25% Notes due 2025**:
   - Fair Value: $742 million
   - Carrying Value: $732 million
   - Difference: $742 - $732 = $10 million

**Total Pre-tax Gains** = $24 million + $89 million + $62 million + $29 million + $36 million + $10 million = $250 million
