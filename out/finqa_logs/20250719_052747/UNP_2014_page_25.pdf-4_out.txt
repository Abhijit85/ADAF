=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the percentage change in fuel surcharge program freight revenue from 2013 to 2014?

**Calculation**:
1. **Extract Data from Text Context**:
   - Fuel surcharge revenue in 2013: $2.6 billion
   - Fuel surcharge revenue in 2014: $2.8 billion

2. **Calculate the Change in Revenue**:
   \[
   \text{Change in Revenue} = \text{Fuel Surcharge Revenue in 2014} - \text{Fuel Surcharge Revenue in 2013}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Change in Revenue} = \$2.8 \text{ billion} - \$2.6 \text{ billion} = \$0.2 \text{ billion}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Percentage Change**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{\text{Change in Revenue}}{\text{Fuel Surcharge Revenue in 2013}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{0.2}{2.6} \right) \times 100 \approx 7.69\%
   \]

**Answer**: The percentage change in fuel surcharge program freight revenue from 2013 to 2014 was approximately 7.69%.
