=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the average industry segment operating profits from 2003 to 2005?

**Calculation**:
1. Extract the industry segment operating profits for each year:
   - 2003: $1734 million
   - 2004: $2040 million
   - 2005: $1923 million

2. Calculate the total operating profits over the three years:
   \[
   \text{Total Operating Profits} = 1734 + 2040 + 1923 = 5697 \text{ million}
   \]

3. Calculate the average operating profits:
   \[
   \text{Average Operating Profits} = \frac{\text{Total Operating Profits}}{\text{Number of Years}} = \frac{5697}{3} = 1899 \text{ million}
   \]

**Answer**: The average industry segment operating profits from 2003 to 2005 was $1899 million.

**Source**: Table data (most reliable for exact numbers)

Answer Echoes:
- 2003: $1,734 million
- 2004: $2,040 million
- 2005: $1,923 million
- **Industry Segment Operating Profits**:
- 2003: $1,734 million
- 2004: $2,040 million
- 2005: $1,923 million
- The text provides additional context about the factors affecting operating profits, such as higher costs and sales volume impacts, but does not provide additional numerical data needed for this calculation.
- Extracted industry segment operating profits for 2003, 2004, and 2005 from the table.
- Summed the operating profits for the three years and divided by the number of years to find the average.
