=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the average effective tax rate for the three-year period?

**Calculation**:
1. Extract the effective tax rates from the table:
   - 2005: 26%
   - 2004: 28%
   - 2003: 26%

2. Sum the effective tax rates:
   \[
   26\% + 28\% + 26\% = 80\%
   \]

3. Calculate the average effective tax rate by dividing the total by the number of years:
   \[
   \text{Average Effective Tax Rate} = \frac{80\%}{3} = 26.67\%
   \]

**Answer**: The average effective tax rate for the three-year period (2003, 2004, and 2005) is 26.67%.

**Source**: Table data was used for the effective tax rates, and the calculation was verified for mathematical accuracy.

Answer Echoes:
- 2005: 26%
- 2004: 28%
- 2003: 26%
- Effective Tax Rates:
- 2005: 26%
- 2004: 28%
- 2003: 26%
- The text provides additional context on tax adjustments and benefits but does not alter the effective tax rates provided in the table.
- \(26\% + 28\% + 26\% = 80\%\)
- \(\text{Average Effective Tax Rate} = \frac{80\%}{3}\)
- \(\text{Average Effective Tax Rate} = 26.67\%\)
- Extracted effective tax rates from the table: 26% (2005), 28% (2004), 26% (2003).
- Summed the effective tax rates for the three years and divided by the number of years to find the average.
- The average effective tax rate for the three-year period (2003, 2004, and 2005) is 26.67%.
