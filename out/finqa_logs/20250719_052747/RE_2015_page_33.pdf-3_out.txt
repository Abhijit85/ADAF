=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the total value of fixed maturities and cash as of December 31, 2015, in billions?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Total Cash and Invested Assets**:
   - Total cash and invested assets = $17.7 billion

2. **Determine the Percentage of Fixed Maturities and Cash**:
   - Percentage of fixed maturities and cash = 87.4%

3. **Calculate the Total Value of Fixed Maturities and Cash**:
   - Total value of fixed maturities and cash = Total cash and invested assets × Percentage of fixed maturities and cash
   - Total value of fixed maturities and cash = $17.7 billion × 0.874

4. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - Total value of fixed maturities and cash = $17.7 billion × 0.874 = $15.4698 billion

**Answer**: The total value of fixed maturities and cash as of December 31, 2015, is approximately $15.47 billion.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context and table data.

Answer Echoes:
- The company's cash and invested assets totaled $17.7 billion at December 31, 2015.
- Fixed maturities and cash constitute 87.4% of the total cash and invested assets.
- The table does not provide explicit values for fixed maturities or cash, but it confirms the total cash and invested assets value.
- Total cash and invested assets = $17.7 billion
- Percentage of fixed maturities and cash = 87.4%
- Total value of fixed maturities and cash = Total cash and invested assets × Percentage of fixed maturities and cash
- Total value of fixed maturities and cash = $17.7 billion × 87.4%
- Total value of fixed maturities and cash = $17.7 billion × 0.874
- Total value of fixed maturities and cash = $15.4698 billion
- Total cash and invested assets = $17.7 billion
- Percentage of fixed maturities and cash = 87.4%
- Total value of fixed maturities and cash = $17.7 billion × 0.874 = $15.4698 billion
