=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Did the share of securities rated AAA/Aaa increase between 2008 and 2009?

**Calculation**:
1. Extract the relevant data from the table:
   - AAA/Aaa percentage for December 31, 2009: 14%
   - AAA/Aaa percentage for December 31, 2008: 19%
2. Calculate the difference between the two percentages:
   - Difference = 14% (2009) - 19% (2008) = -5%

**Answer**: The share of securities rated AAA/Aaa decreased by 5% from 2008 to 2009.

**Source**: Table data was used for the exact percentages, and the text context provided additional understanding of the importance of these ratings.

Answer Echoes:
- AAA/Aaa percentage for December 31, 2009: 14%
- AAA/Aaa percentage for December 31, 2008: 19%
- Compare the two percentages to see if there was an increase or decrease.
- Difference = 14% (2009) - 19% (2008) = -5%
- **Arithmetic Type**: Comparison of percentages
- **Data Requirements**: AAA/Aaa percentages for 2008 and 2009
- **Context Needs**: Understanding of what the percentages represent
- **Calculation Steps**: Determine the difference between the two percentages
- **Exact Numbers**:
- AAA/Aaa percentage for December 31, 2009: 14%
- AAA/Aaa percentage for December 31, 2008: 19%
- **Additional Context**: The text provides background on how securities are rated and the importance of these ratings but does not directly affect the percentage comparison.
- **Change Percentages**: Calculate the difference between the two percentages to determine if there was an increase or decrease.
- 2009: 14%
- 2008: 19%
- Difference = 14% (2009) - 19% (2008) = -5%
- 2009 AAA/Aaa percentage: 14%
- 2008 AAA/Aaa percentage: 19%
- Difference = 14% - 19% = -5%
