=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the ratio of the 2016 hedged gallons to 2017?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Components**: We need to calculate the ratio of hedged gallons in 2016 to those in 2017.
2. **Extract Numbers**: From the table, we have:
   - 2016 Hedged Gallons: 27000000
   - 2017 Hedged Gallons: 12000000
3. **Calculate Ratio**:
   - Ratio = 2016 Hedged Gallons / 2017 Hedged Gallons
   - Ratio = 27000000 / 12000000
4. **Simplify the Ratio**:
   - Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 3000000.
   - Ratio = (27000000 ÷ 3000000) / (12000000 ÷ 3000000)
   - Ratio = 9 / 4

**Answer**: The ratio of 2016 hedged gallons to 2017 hedged gallons is 9:4.

**Source**: Table data.

Answer Echoes:
- We need to find the ratio of hedged gallons in 2016 to those in 2017.
- 2016 Hedged Gallons: 27,000,000
- 2017 Hedged Gallons: 12,000,000
- Ratio = 2016 Hedged Gallons / 2017 Hedged Gallons
- Ratio = 27,000,000 / 12,000,000
- Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 3,000,000.
- Ratio = (27,000,000 ÷ 3,000,000) / (12,000,000 ÷ 3,000,000)
- Ratio = 9 / 4
- The ratio of 2016 hedged gallons to 2017 hedged gallons is 9:4.
- Ratio = 2016 Hedged Gallons / 2017 Hedged Gallons
- Ratio = 27,000,000 / 12,000,000
- Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 3,000,000.
- Ratio = (27,000,000 ÷ 3,000,000) / (12,000,000 ÷ 3,000,000)
- Ratio = 9 / 4
