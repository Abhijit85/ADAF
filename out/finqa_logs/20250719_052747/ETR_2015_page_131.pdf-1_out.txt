=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the percent change in annual long-term debt maturities from 2016 to 2017?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base**: The base year is 2016 with an amount of $204079 (in thousands).
2. **Identify Part**: The year 2017 with an amount of $766451 (in thousands).
3. **Calculate the Change**: 
   - Change = 2017 amount - 2016 amount
   - Change = $766451 - $204079 = $562372 (in thousands)
4. **Calculate the Percentage Change**:
   - Percentage Change = (Change / Base) × 100
   - Percentage Change = ($562372 / $204079) × 100
   - Percentage Change ≈ 275.56%

**Answer**: The percent change in annual long-term debt maturities from 2016 to 2017 is approximately 275.56%.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Change = 2017 amount - 2016 amount
- Change = $766,451 - $204,079 = $562,372 (in thousands)
- Percentage Change = (Change / Base) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($562,372 / $204,079) × 100
- Percentage Change ≈ 275.56%
- **2016 Amount**: $204,079 (in thousands)
- **2017 Amount**: $766,451 (in thousands)
- Change = 2017 amount - 2016 amount
- Change = $766,451 - $204,079 = $562,372 (in thousands)
- Percentage Change = (Change / Base) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($562,372 / $204,079) × 100
- Percentage Change ≈ 275.56%
