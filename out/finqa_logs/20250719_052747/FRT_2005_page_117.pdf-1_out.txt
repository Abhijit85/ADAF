=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the growth of the additions in comparison with the growth of the deductions during 2003 and 2004?

**Calculation**:

1. **Additions Growth Calculation**:
   - **Additions in 2003**: $68125000
   - **Additions in 2004**: $82551000
   - **Growth in Additions**:
     \[
     \text{Growth in Additions} = \frac{82551000 - 68125000}{68125000} \times 100
     \]
     \[
     = \frac{14426000}{68125000} \times 100 \approx 21.17\%
     \]

2. **Deductions Growth Calculation**:
   - **Deductions in 2003**: $4645000
   - **Deductions in 2004**: $1390000
   - **Growth in Deductions**:
     \[
     \text{Growth in Deductions} = \frac{1390000 - 4645000}{4645000} \times 100
     \]
     \[
     = \frac{-3255000}{4645000} \times 100 \approx -70.06\%
     \]

**Answer**: The growth of the additions was 21.17%, while the deductions decreased by 70.06% from 2003 to 2004.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data.

Answer Echoes:
- **Additions Growth**: 21.17%
- **Deductions Growth**: -70.06%
- **Arithmetic Type**: Percentage growth comparison
- **Data Requirements**: Additions and deductions for 2003 and 2004
- **Context Needs**: Understanding of the financial context and reporting period
- **Additions in 2003**: $68,125,000
- **Additions in 2004**: $82,551,000
- **Deductions in 2003**: $4,645,000
- **Deductions in 2004**: $1,390,000
- **Additions Growth**: 21.17%
- **Deductions Growth**: -70.06%
