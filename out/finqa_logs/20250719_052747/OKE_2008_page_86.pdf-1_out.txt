=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the total net change in net fair value of derivatives outstanding between 2007 and 2008 in thousands?

**Calculation**:
1. **Initial Net Fair Value at December 31, 2007**: $25171 (thousands of dollars)
2. **Net Fair Value at December 31, 2008**: $258800 (thousands of dollars)

To find the total net change, we calculate the difference between the net fair value at the end of 2008 and the net fair value at the end of 2007:

\[
\text{Net Change} = \text{Net Fair Value at December 31, 2008} - \text{Net Fair Value at December 31, 2007}
\]

\[
\text{Net Change} = 258800 - 25171 = 233629 \text{ (thousands of dollars)}
\]

**Answer**: The total net change in net fair value of derivatives outstanding between 2007 and 2008 is $233629 thousand.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- **Initial Net Fair Value at December 31, 2007**: $25,171 (thousands of dollars)
- **Net Fair Value at December 31, 2008**: $258,800 (thousands of dollars)
