=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: For fiscal 2018, what percentage of the total change in the valuation allowance was due to settlements with taxing authorities?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Total Change in Valuation Allowance**:
   - Beginning balance (2018): $172945
   - Ending balance (2018): $196152
   - Total Change = Ending balance - Beginning balance = $196152 - $172945 = $23207

2. **Identify Part Due to Settlements with Taxing Authorities**:
   - Settlements with taxing authorities (2018): $0

3. **Calculate Percentage**:
   - Percentage = (Part due to settlements / Total Change) × 100
   - Percentage = (0 / 23207) × 100 = 0%

**Answer**: 0%

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- **Beginning balance (2018)**: $172,945
- **Ending balance (2018)**: $196,152
- **Settlements with taxing authorities (2018)**: $0 (indicated by '—')
- **Beginning balance (2018)**: $172,945
- **Ending balance (2018)**: $196,152
- **Settlements with taxing authorities (2018)**: $0
- The text confirms that there were no settlements with taxing authorities contributing to the change in the valuation allowance for fiscal 2018.
- Since the amount due to settlements with taxing authorities is $0, the percentage is calculated as:
- Total change in valuation allowance: $23,207
- Amount due to settlements: $0
- Total Change = $23,207
- Percentage due to settlements = \( \frac{0}{23,207} \times 100 = 0\% \)
