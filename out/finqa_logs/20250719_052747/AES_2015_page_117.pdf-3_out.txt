=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What were average proportional recoverable environmental capital expenditures for the years December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, in millions?

**Calculation**:
1. **Extract Data from Text Context**:
   - 2015: $205 million
   - 2014: $163 million
   - 2013: $110 million

2. **Sum the Recoverable Expenditures**:
   \[
   \text{Total Recoverable Expenditures} = 205 + 163 + 110 = 478 \text{ million}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Average**:
   \[
   \text{Average Recoverable Expenditures} = \frac{478}{3} = 159.33 \text{ million}
   \]

**Answer**: The average proportional recoverable environmental capital expenditures for the years ending December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, were $159.33 million.

**Source**: Text Context
