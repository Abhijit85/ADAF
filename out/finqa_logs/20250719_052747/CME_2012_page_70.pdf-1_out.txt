=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the percent of available potential to increase the multi-currency line of credit?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Current and Potential Line of Credit**:
   - Current line of credit: $5.0 billion
   - Potential line of credit: $7.0 billion

2. **Calculate the Increase in Line of Credit**:
   - Increase = Potential line of credit - Current line of credit
   - Increase = $7.0 billion - $5.0 billion = $2.0 billion

3. **Calculate the Percentage Increase**:
   - Percentage Increase = (Increase / Current line of credit) × 100
   - Percentage Increase = ($2.0 billion / $5.0 billion) × 100
   - Percentage Increase = 0.4 × 100
   - Percentage Increase = 40%

**Answer**: The percent of available potential to increase the multi-currency line of credit is 40%.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context and table data.

Answer Echoes:
- Current multi-currency line of credit: $5.0 billion
- Potential increase option: Up to $7.0 billion
- The table does not provide specific information about the line of credit, but it lists other financial safeguard components.
- Current line of credit: $5.0 billion
- Potential line of credit: $7.0 billion
- Increase = Potential line of credit - Current line of credit
- Increase = $7.0 billion - $5.0 billion = $2.0 billion
- Percentage Increase = (Increase / Current line of credit) × 100
- Percentage Increase = ($2.0 billion / $5.0 billion) × 100
- Percentage Increase = 0.4 × 100
- Percentage Increase = 40%
- Current line of credit: $5.0 billion
- Potential line of credit: $7.0 billion
- Increase in line of credit: $2.0 billion
- Percentage increase: 40%
