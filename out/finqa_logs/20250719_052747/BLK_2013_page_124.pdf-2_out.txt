=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the carrying value of notes due by 2017?

**Calculation**: 
To find the carrying value of notes due by 2017, we need to sum the carrying values of the notes that are due by that year. From the table data, the relevant notes and their carrying values are:

- **3.50% Notes due 2014**: Carrying Value = $1000 million
- **1.375% Notes due 2015**: Carrying Value = $750 million
- **6.25% Notes due 2017**: Carrying Value = $698 million

Adding these values together gives:

\[
1000 + 750 + 698 = 2448
\]

**Answer**: $2448 million

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data.

Answer Echoes:
- **3.50% Notes due 2014**: Carrying Value = $1,000 million
- **1.375% Notes due 2015**: Carrying Value = $750 million
- **6.25% Notes due 2017**: Carrying Value = $698 million
- **3.50% Notes due 2014**: Carrying Value = $1,000 million
- **1.375% Notes due 2015**: Carrying Value = $750 million
- **6.25% Notes due 2017**: Carrying Value = $698 million
