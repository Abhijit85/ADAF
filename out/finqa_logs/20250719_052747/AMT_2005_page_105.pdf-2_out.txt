=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the total value of net operating loss carryforwards?

**Calculation**:
1. **Extract Data from Text Context**:
   - Federal net operating loss carryforwards: Approximately $2.2 billion
   - State net operating loss carryforwards: Approximately $2.4 billion

2. **Extract Data from Table**:
   - Federal: $2157503 (in thousands) = $2157503000
   - State: $2418012 (in thousands) = $2418012000

3. **Convert Table Values to Billions**:
   - Federal: $2157503000 = $2.157 billion
   - State: $2418012000 = $2.418 billion

4. **Summation**:
   - Total net operating loss carryforwards = Federal + State
   - Total = $2.157 billion + $2.418 billion
   - Total = $4.575 billion

**Answer**: The total value of net operating loss carryforwards is approximately $4.58 billion.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- The text mentions that at December 31, 2005, the company had net federal and state operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income of approximately $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively.
- The table provides a breakdown of financial data categorized by years and separated into "Federal" and "State" columns. The total values at the bottom of the table are:
- Federal: $2,157,503 (in thousands)
- State: $2,418,012 (in thousands)
- Federal: $2,157,503,000 (since the table values are in thousands)
- State: $2,418,012,000
- The text context provides approximate values of $2.2 billion for federal and $2.4 billion for state net operating loss carryforwards, which align closely with the table values when converted to billions.
- Total net operating loss carryforwards = Federal + State
- Total = $2,157,503,000 + $2,418,012,000
- Total = $4,575,515,000
- From text: Federal = $2.2 billion, State = $2.4 billion
- From table: Federal = $2,157,503,000, State = $2,418,012,000
- Convert table values to billions
- Sum federal and state values
