=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the percent of the increase in non-utility nuclear earnings in 2002?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Increase in Earnings**:
   - Earnings in 2001: $128 million
   - Earnings in 2002: $201 million
   - Increase in earnings = $201 million - $128 million = $73 million

2. **Calculate the Percent Increase**:
   - Percent Increase = (Increase in earnings / Earnings in 2001) * 100
   - Percent Increase = ($73 million / $128 million) * 100
   - Percent Increase = 0.5703125 * 100 = 57.03%

**Answer**: The percent increase in non-utility nuclear earnings in 2002 was 57.03%.

**Source**: Text context (earnings figures for 2001 and 2002)

Answer Echoes:
- Net MW in operation at December 31 for 2000, 2001, and 2002.
- Generation in GWh for the years 2000, 2001, and 2002.
- Capacity factor for the years 2000, 2001, and 2002.
- Earnings in 2001 for non-utility nuclear: $128 million
- Earnings in 2002 for non-utility nuclear: $201 million
- Increase in earnings = Earnings in 2002 - Earnings in 2001
- Increase in earnings = $201 million - $128 million = $73 million
- Percent Increase = (Increase in earnings / Earnings in 2001) * 100
- Percent Increase = ($73 million / $128 million) * 100
- Percent Increase = 0.5703125 * 100 = 57.03%
- Increase = $201 million - $128 million = $73 million
- Percent Increase = ($73 million / $128 million) * 100 = 57.03%
