=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the total possible purchase price for Impella, including potential contingent payments, in millions?

**Calculation**:
1. **Initial Purchase Price**: $45.1 million
   - Composed of $42.2 million in common stock, $1.6 million in cash, and $1.3 million in transaction costs.
2. **Potential Contingent Payments**: Up to $11.2 million based on milestone achievements related to FDA approvals.

To find the total possible purchase price, we add the initial purchase price and the maximum potential contingent payments:

\[ \text{Total Possible Purchase Price} = \text{Initial Purchase Price} + \text{Potential Contingent Payments} \]

\[ \text{Total Possible Purchase Price} = 45.1 \, \text{million} + 11.2 \, \text{million} \]

\[ \text{Total Possible Purchase Price} = 56.3 \, \text{million} \]

**Answer**: The total possible purchase price for Impella, including potential contingent payments, is $56.3 million.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context, as the table did not provide relevant data.

Answer Echoes:
- The aggregate purchase price for Impella, excluding contingent payments, was approximately $45.1 million. This includes:
- $42.2 million in common stock
- $1.6 million in cash
- $1.3 million in transaction costs
- There is a potential for additional contingent payments up to $11.2 million based on milestone achievements related to FDA approvals.
