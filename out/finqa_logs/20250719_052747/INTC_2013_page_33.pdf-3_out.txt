=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the percentage change in diluted earnings per common share between December 29, 2012, and December 28, 2013?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Values**:
   - Diluted earnings per common share on December 29, 2012: $2.13
   - Diluted earnings per common share on December 28, 2013: $1.89

2. **Calculate the Change**:
   \[
   \text{Change in diluted earnings per share} = \$1.89 - \$2.13 = -\$0.24
   \]

3. **Calculate the Percentage Change**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage change} = \left(\frac{\text{Change}}{\text{Original value}}\right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage change} = \left(\frac{-\$0.24}{\$2.13}\right) \times 100 \approx -11.27\%
   \]

**Answer**: The percentage change in diluted earnings per common share from December 29, 2012, to December 28, 2013, is approximately \(-11.27\%\).

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Diluted earnings per common share on December 29, 2012: $2.13
- Diluted earnings per common share on December 28, 2013: $1.89
- Change in diluted earnings per share = $1.89 - $2.13 = -$0.24
- Percentage change = (Change / Original value) × 100
- Percentage change = (-$0.24 / $2.13) × 100
- Percentage change = (-0.24 / 2.13) × 100 ≈ -11.27%
- Diluted earnings per common share on December 29, 2012: $2.13
- Diluted earnings per common share on December 28, 2013: $1.89
