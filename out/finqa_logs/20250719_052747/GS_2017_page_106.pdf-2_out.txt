=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What percentage of total market risk for positions, accounted for at fair value, that are not included in VaR is comprised of equity in 2017?

**Calculation**:
1. **Extract Data**:
   - Equity in 2017: $2096 million
   - Total market risk in 2017: $3702 million

2. **Calculate Percentage**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Equity}}{\text{Total}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{2096}{3702}\right) \times 100
   \]

3. **Perform Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{2096}{3702}\right) \times 100 \approx 56.63\%
   \]

**Answer**: In 2017, 56.63% of the total market risk for positions, accounted for at fair value and not included in VaR, was comprised of equity.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data.

Answer Echoes:
- **Base**: Total market risk for positions in 2017, which is the "Total" value from the table.
- **Part**: The portion of the total market risk comprised of "Equity" in 2017.
- **Equity in 2017**: $2,096 million
- **Total in 2017**: $3,702 million
- **Equity in 2017**: $2,096 million
- **Total in 2017**: $3,702 million
- Equity in 2017: $2,096 million
- Total in 2017: $3,702 million
- Percentage = \((2,096 / 3,702) \times 100 = 56.63\%\)
