=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What were capital expenditures associated with the retail segment since its inception, exclusive of the amount incurred during 2003, in millions?

**Calculation**:
1. **Total Capital Expenditures through 2003**: $290 million (from text context).
2. **Capital Expenditures during 2003**: $92 million (from text context).
3. **Capital Expenditures before 2003**: Subtract the expenditures during 2003 from the total expenditures through 2003.

   \[
   \text{Capital Expenditures before 2003} = 290 \, \text{million} - 92 \, \text{million} = 198 \, \text{million}
   \]

**Answer**: $198 million.

**Source**: Text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Total capital expenditures associated with the retail segment since its inception through the end of fiscal 2003: $290 million.
- Capital expenditures incurred during 2003: $92 million.
