=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Recognized net gains of $107 million in 2009 on the valuation and sale of commercial mortgage loans held for sale, net of hedges, were what percent of residential mortgages at fair value?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Base**: The base is the residential mortgages at fair value, which is $1012 million.
2. **Identify the Part**: The part is the recognized net gains of $107 million.
3. **Calculate the Percentage**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Base}}\right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{107}{1012}\right) \times 100
   \]
4. **Perform the Calculation**:
   \[
   \frac{107}{1012} \approx 0.1057
   \]
   \[
   0.1057 \times 100 \approx 10.57\%
   \]

**Answer**: The recognized net gains of $107 million in 2009 on the valuation and sale of commercial mortgage loans held for sale, net of hedges, represent approximately **10.57%** of the residential mortgages at fair value.
