=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the net equity in the assets acquired?

**Calculation**:
1. **Extract Values**:
   - Total assets acquired = $2378 million
   - Total liabilities acquired = $144 million

2. **Apply the Accounting Equation**:
   \[
   \text{Equity} = \text{Assets} - \text{Liabilities}
   \]

3. **Calculate Equity**:
   \[
   \text{Equity} = 2378 - 144 = 2234
   \]

**Answer**: The net equity in the assets acquired is $2234 million.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- **Total assets acquired**: $2,378
- **Total liabilities acquired**: $(144)$
- Total assets acquired = $2,378
- Total liabilities acquired = $144 (note: liabilities are typically shown as negative in financial statements, but for calculation purposes, we use the absolute value)
