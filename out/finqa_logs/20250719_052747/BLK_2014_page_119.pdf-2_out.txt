=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the fair value of all notes due by 2019?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Relevant Notes**: 
   - 1.375% Notes due 2015
   - 6.25% Notes due 2017
   - 5.00% Notes due 2019

2. **Extract Fair Values**:
   - Fair value of 1.375% Notes due 2015: $753 million
   - Fair value of 6.25% Notes due 2017: $785 million
   - Fair value of 5.00% Notes due 2019: $1134 million

3. **Calculate Total Fair Value**:
   \[
   \text{Total Fair Value} = 753 + 785 + 1134 = 2672
   \]

**Answer**: The fair value of all notes due by 2019 is $2672 million.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- 1.375% Notes due 2015
- 6.25% Notes due 2017
- 5.00% Notes due 2019
- Fair value of 1.375% Notes due 2015: $753 million
- Fair value of 6.25% Notes due 2017: $785 million
- Fair value of 5.00% Notes due 2019: $1,134 million
- Total Fair Value = $753 million + $785 million + $1,134 million
- From the financial context, we need to consider notes that are due by 2019. These are:
- 1.375% Notes due 2015
- 6.25% Notes due 2017
- 5.00% Notes due 2019
- Fair value of 1.375% Notes due 2015: $753 million
- Fair value of 6.25% Notes due 2017: $785 million
- Fair value of 5.00% Notes due 2019: $1,134 million
- Sum the fair values of the notes identified:
