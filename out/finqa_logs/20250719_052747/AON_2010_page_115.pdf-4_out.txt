=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the percentage increase in total stock-based compensation expense from 2009 to 2010?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base**: The base value is the total stock-based compensation expense for 2009, which is $209 million.
2. **Identify Part**: The part value is the total stock-based compensation expense for 2010, which is $221 million.
3. **Calculate the Increase**: 
   - Increase = 2010 Value - 2009 Value = $221 million - $209 million = $12 million
4. **Calculate the Percentage Increase**: 
   - Percentage Increase = (Increase / 2009 Value) × 100
   - Percentage Increase = ($12 million / $209 million) × 100 ≈ 5.74%

**Answer**: The percentage increase in total stock-based compensation expense from 2009 to 2010 is approximately 5.74%.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- 2009 Total Stock-Based Compensation Expense = $209
- 2010 Total Stock-Based Compensation Expense = $221
- Increase = 2010 Value - 2009 Value = $221 - $209 = $12
- Percentage Increase = (Increase / 2009 Value) × 100
- Percentage Increase = ($12 / $209) × 100 ≈ 5.74%
- Increase = 2010 Value - 2009 Value = $221 million - $209 million = $12 million
- Percentage Increase = (Increase / 2009 Value) × 100
- Percentage Increase = ($12 million / $209 million) × 100 ≈ 5.74%
