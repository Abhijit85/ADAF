=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the net effect of the one-percentage point increase and decrease on total service and interest cost components?

**Calculation**:
1. Identify the values from the table:
   - Effect of a one-percentage-point increase: $7367
   - Effect of a one-percentage-point decrease: $(5974)

2. Calculate the net effect:
   - Net Effect = Increase Effect + Decrease Effect
   - Net Effect = $7367 + (-$5974)
   - Net Effect = $7367 - $5974
   - Net Effect = $1393

**Answer**: The net effect of the one-percentage-point increase and decrease on total service and interest cost components is $1393.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Effect of a one-percentage-point increase: $7,367
- Effect of a one-percentage-point decrease: $(5,974)
- Net Effect = Increase Effect + Decrease Effect
- Net Effect = $7,367 + (-$5,974)
- Net Effect = $7,367 - $5,974
- Net Effect = $1,393
- **Arithmetic Type**: Difference
- **Data Requirements**: Effect of a one-percentage-point increase and decrease
- **Context Needs**: Understanding of how these effects influence the total service and interest cost components
- **Exact Numbers**:
- Effect of a one-percentage-point increase: $7,367
- Effect of a one-percentage-point decrease: $(5,974)
- **Additional Context**: The effects are related to changes in health care cost trend rates and their impact on service and interest cost components.
- **Combined Operations**: Calculate the net effect by summing the increase and decrease effects.
- Increase Effect: $7,367
- Decrease Effect: $(5,974)
- Values are directly provided in the table data.
- Net Effect = Increase Effect + Decrease Effect
- Net Effect = $7,367 + (-$5,974)
- Net Effect = $7,367 - $5,974
- Net Effect = $1,393
- The calculation is straightforward and checks out mathematically.
- The net effect is presented in dollars.
- Increase Effect: $7,367
- Decrease Effect: $(5,974)
- Net Effect = $7,367 - $5,974 = $1,393
