=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the cumulative lease payments to the employee who became an officer of the company following his business acquisition from 2008 to 2010?

**Calculation**:
1. Lease payment for 2008: $0.9 million
2. Lease payment for 2009: $0.9 million
3. Lease payment for 2010: $1.0 million

Cumulative lease payments = $0.9 million + $0.9 million + $1.0 million

\[ \text{Cumulative Lease Payments} = 0.9 + 0.9 + 1.0 = 2.8 \text{ million dollars} \]

**Answer**: The cumulative lease payments to the employee who became an officer from 2008 to 2010 were $2.8 million.

**Source**: Text context (as the table did not provide data for 2008 to 2010).

Answer Echoes:
- **2008**: $0.9 million
- **2009**: $0.9 million
- **2010**: $1.0 million
