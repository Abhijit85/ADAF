=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the change in the warranty reserve from 2017 to 2018?

**Calculation**: 
1. Identify the ending balances from the table:
   - Balance as of December 31, 2017: $23151
   - Balance as of December 31, 2018: $23262

2. Calculate the change in the warranty reserve:
   - Change = Balance at the end of 2018 - Balance at the end of 2017
   - Change = $23262 - $23151

3. Perform the calculation:
   - Change = $23262 - $23151 = $111

**Answer**: The change in the warranty reserve from 2017 to 2018 is $111.

**Source**: Table data was used for the exact numbers, and the text context provided additional understanding of how warranty reserves are calculated and recorded.

Answer Echoes:
- Balance as of December 31, 2017: $23,151
- Balance as of December 31, 2018: $23,262
- Change in warranty reserve = Balance at the end of 2018 - Balance at the end of 2017
- Change = $23,262 - $23,151
- Change = $23,262 - $23,151 = $111
- **Arithmetic Type**: Difference
- **Data Requirements**: Ending balances of warranty reserve for 2017 and 2018
- **Context Needs**: Understanding of warranty reserve calculation
- **Calculation Steps**: Subtract the 2017 balance from the 2018 balance
- **Exact Numbers**:
- Balance as of December 31, 2017: $23,151
- Balance as of December 31, 2018: $23,262
- **Additional Context**: The warranty reserve is calculated using historical claim information and is recorded within other accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities.
- **Perform the Calculation**:
- Change in warranty reserve = Balance at the end of 2018 - Balance at the end of 2017
- Change = $23,262 - $23,151
- 2017 Ending Balance: $23,151
- 2018 Ending Balance: $23,262
- Change = $23,262 - $23,151 = $111
