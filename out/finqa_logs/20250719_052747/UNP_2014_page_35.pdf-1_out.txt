=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What would 2014 capital expenditures have been without the early buyout of the operating lease of the headquarters, in millions?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Known Capital Expenditures**:
   - Early buyout of headquarters lease: $261 million
   - Early buyout of locomotives and freight cars: $99 million

2. **Assumption**:
   - Assume that the total capital expenditures for 2014 include the $261 million for the headquarters lease buyout.

3. **Calculate Adjusted Capital Expenditures**:
   - Adjusted capital expenditures = Total capital expenditures - $261 million

**Answer**: Without the specific total capital expenditures figure for 2014, we cannot provide an exact numerical result. However, the adjusted capital expenditures would be the total capital expenditures minus $261 million.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context (early buyout costs) and logical assumptions.

Answer Echoes:
- The early buyout of the long-term operating lease of the headquarters building cost approximately $261 million.
- Capital investments in 2014 also included $99 million for the early buyout of locomotives and freight cars.
- The table does not provide explicit values for total capital expenditures in 2014, nor does it break down the components of capital expenditures.
- Early buyout of headquarters lease: $261 million
- Early buyout of locomotives and freight cars: $99 million
- Since the total capital expenditures for 2014 are not directly provided, we need to infer the total by considering the known components.
- To find the capital expenditures without the early buyout of the headquarters lease, subtract the $261 million from the total capital expenditures.
- Assume that the total capital expenditures include the $261 million for the headquarters lease buyout. Without explicit total capital expenditure data, this assumption is necessary for calculation.
- Early buyout of headquarters lease: $261 million
- Early buyout of locomotives and freight cars: $99 million
- Total capital expenditures (assumed to include the $261 million): Unknown
- Adjusted capital expenditures = Total capital expenditures - $261 million
- The total capital expenditures for 2014 are not explicitly provided. To accurately calculate the adjusted capital expenditures, the total capital expenditures figure is needed.
