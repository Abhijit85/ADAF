=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: For the sale of the 19 percent outside-operated interest in the Corrib natural gas development offshore Ireland, what is the total expected proceeds in millions?

**Calculation**:
1. **Initial Payment**: $100 million
2. **Additional Fixed Proceeds**: $135 million

To calculate the total expected proceeds, we sum the initial payment and the additional fixed proceeds:

\[ \text{Total Expected Proceeds} = \text{Initial Payment} + \text{Additional Fixed Proceeds} \]
\[ \text{Total Expected Proceeds} = 100 + 135 = 235 \]

**Answer**: The total expected proceeds from the sale of the 19 percent outside-operated interest in the Corrib natural gas development offshore Ireland is $235 million.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Initial payment of $100 million and additional fixed proceeds of $135 million were identified from the text context.
- Total expected proceeds = $100 million (initial payment) + $135 million (additional fixed proceeds) = $235 million.
