=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What were total tax benefits realized for deductions during 2007 and 2006 in excess of the stock-based compensation expense for options exercised and other stock-based awards vested in millions?

**Calculation**:
1. Identify the tax benefits realized for each year:
   - 2007: $30 million
   - 2006: $36 million

2. Sum the tax benefits realized for both years:
   - Total tax benefits for 2007 and 2006 = $30 million (2007) + $36 million (2006)

**Answer**: The total tax benefits realized for deductions during 2007 and 2006 in excess of the stock-based compensation expense for options exercised and other stock-based awards vested were $66 million.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context.

Answer Echoes:
- The table does not provide information on the stock-based compensation expense or the tax benefits realized from deductions.
- We need data on the actual stock-based compensation expense and the tax benefits realized to perform the calculation.
- **Stock-Based Compensation Expense**: The expense recorded for stock options and awards.
- **Tax Benefits Realized**: The tax savings from deductions related to stock options and awards.
- Without the specific values for stock-based compensation expense and tax benefits realized, we cannot calculate the total tax benefits in excess of the stock-based compensation expense.
- **Stock-based compensation expense**:
- 2007: $80 million
- 2006: $83 million
- **Tax benefits realized for deductions in excess of stock-based compensation expense**:
- 2007: $30 million
- 2006: $36 million
- 2007: $30 million
- 2006: $36 million
- Total tax benefits for 2007 and 2006 = $30 million (2007) + $36 million (2006)
- Tax benefits realized in excess of stock-based compensation expense were $30 million in 2007 and $36 million in 2006.
- Total tax benefits realized = $30 million + $36 million = $66 million
