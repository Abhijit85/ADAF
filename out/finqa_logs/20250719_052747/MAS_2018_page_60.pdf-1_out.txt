=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What are the total current assets of Kichler included in the acquisition price with the revised version?

**Calculation**:
To determine the total current assets of Kichler included in the acquisition price with the revised version, we need to sum the values of receivables, inventories, and prepaid expenses and other from the revised financial data.

1. **Receivables**: $100 million
2. **Inventories**: $166 million
3. **Prepaid expenses and other**: $5 million

\[ \text{Total Current Assets} = \text{Receivables} + \text{Inventories} + \text{Prepaid expenses and other} \]

\[ \text{Total Current Assets} = 100 + 166 + 5 \]

\[ \text{Total Current Assets} = 271 \]

**Answer**: $271 million

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.
