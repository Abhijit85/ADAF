=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: If current development costs increased in 2008 as much as in 2007, what would the 2008 total be, in millions?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Development Costs for 2006 and 2007**:
   - Development costs in 2007: $1654 million
   - Development costs in 2006: $1251 million

2. **Calculate the Increase from 2006 to 2007**:
   - Increase = Development costs in 2007 - Development costs in 2006
   - Increase = $1654 million - $1251 million = $403 million

3. **Apply the Same Increase to 2008**:
   - Assuming the development costs increase by the same amount in 2008 as they did in 2007:
   - Development costs in 2008 = Development costs in 2007 + Increase
   - Development costs in 2008 = $1654 million + $403 million = $2057 million

**Answer**: $2057 million

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- **Development costs in 2007**: $1,654 million
- **Development costs in 2006**: $1,251 million
- **Increase from 2006 to 2007**: $1,654 million - $1,251 million = $403 million
- **Development costs in 2008**: $1,654 million + $403 million = $2,057 million
- From the table data, we have:
- **Development costs in 2007**: $1,654 million
- **Development costs in 2006**: $1,251 million
- Increase = Development costs in 2007 - Development costs in 2006
- Increase = $1,654 million - $1,251 million = $403 million
- Assuming the development costs increase by the same amount in 2008 as they did in 2007:
- Development costs in 2008 = Development costs in 2007 + Increase
- Development costs in 2008 = $1,654 million + $403 million = $2,057 million
