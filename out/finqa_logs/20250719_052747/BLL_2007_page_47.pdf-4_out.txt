=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the number of shares outstanding based on the cash dividends paid during 2006, in millions?

**Calculation**:
1. **Extract Data from Text**:
   - Total Cash Dividends Paid in 2006: $41 million
   - Dividend per Share in 2006: 40 cents per share

2. **Convert Dividend per Share to Dollars**:
   - 40 cents per share = $0.40 per share

3. **Calculate Number of Shares Outstanding**:
   \[
   \text{Number of Shares Outstanding} = \frac{\text{Total Cash Dividends Paid}}{\text{Dividend per Share}} = \frac{41000000}{0.40} = 102500000 \text{ shares}
   \]

**Answer**: 102.5 million shares outstanding based on the cash dividends paid during 2006.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context.

Answer Echoes:
- **Total Cash Dividends Paid in 2006**: $41 million
- **Dividend per Share in 2006**: 40 cents per share
- 40 cents per share = $0.40 per share
- Total Cash Dividends Paid: $41 million
- Dividend per Share: $0.40
- Convert 40 cents to dollars: $0.40
- Calculate shares: $41,000,000 / $0.40 = 102,500,000 shares
