=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the percent change in annual long-term debt maturities from 2016 to 2017?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base (2016 Value)**: $270852 (in thousands)
2. **Identify Part (2017 Value)**: $766801 (in thousands)
3. **Calculate the Change**:
   - Change = 2017 Value - 2016 Value
   - Change = $766801 - $270852 = $495949 (in thousands)
4. **Calculate the Percent Change**:
   - Percent Change = (Change / 2016 Value) × 100
   - Percent Change = ($495949 / $270852) × 100
   - Percent Change = 1.831 × 100 = 183.1%

**Answer**: 183.1%

**Source**: Table data was used for the calculation, ensuring accuracy and reliability.

Answer Echoes:
- From the table, the amount for 2016 is $270,852 (in thousands).
- From the table, the amount for 2017 is $766,801 (in thousands).
- Change = 2017 Value - 2016 Value
- Change = $766,801 - $270,852 = $495,949 (in thousands)
- Percent Change = (Change / 2016 Value) × 100
- Percent Change = ($495,949 / $270,852) × 100
- Percent Change = 1.831 × 100 = 183.1%
- **2016 Value**: $270,852 (in thousands)
- **2017 Value**: $766,801 (in thousands)
- Change = 2017 Value - 2016 Value
- Change = $766,801 - $270,852 = $495,949 (in thousands)
- Percent Change = (Change / 2016 Value) × 100
- Percent Change = ($495,949 / $270,852) × 100
- Percent Change = 1.831 × 100 = 183.1%
