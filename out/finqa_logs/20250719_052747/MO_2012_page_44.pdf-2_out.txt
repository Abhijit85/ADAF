=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What are the cost reduction initiatives as a percentage of the operating companies' income increase?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base and Part**:
   - **Base**: The increase in operating companies' income ($119 million).
   - **Part**: The cost reduction initiatives ($198 million).

2. **Percentage Calculation**:
   - Use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Cost Reduction Initiatives}}{\text{Operating Income Increase}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Substitute the values:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{198}{119} \right) \times 100
     \]

3. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - \(\frac{198}{119} \approx 1.6639\)
   - Multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage:
     \[
     1.6639 \times 100 \approx 166.39\%
     \]

**Answer**: The cost reduction initiatives represent approximately 166.39% of the operating companies' income increase.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context.

Answer Echoes:
- **Base**: The increase in operating companies' income.
- **Part**: The cost reduction initiatives.
- The table does not provide any information about operating income or cost reduction initiatives. It only includes shipment volumes for different products.
- Since we do not have the necessary financial data (operating income increase and cost reduction amounts), we cannot perform the percentage calculation.
- The text states that the operating companies' income increased by $119 million.
- The cost reduction initiatives contributed $198 million in savings.
- **Base**: The increase in operating companies' income ($119 million).
- **Part**: The cost reduction initiatives ($198 million).
- To find the percentage of the income increase attributed to cost reduction initiatives, use the formula:
- Substitute the values:
- \(\frac{198}{119} \approx 1.6639\)
- Multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage:
