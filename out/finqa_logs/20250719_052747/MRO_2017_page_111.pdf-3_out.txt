=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What would end of year proven reserves be without the increase for extensions, discoveries, and other additions, in mmboe?

**Calculation**:
1. **Start with the Beginning of Year Reserves**: 552 mmboe
2. **Add Revisions of Previous Estimates**: 552 mmboe + 5 mmboe = 557 mmboe
3. **Add Purchases of Reserves in Place**: 557 mmboe + 15 mmboe = 572 mmboe
4. **Subtract Transfers to Proved Developed**: 572 mmboe - 83 mmboe = 489 mmboe
5. **Exclude Extensions, Discoveries, and Other Additions**: Since we are asked to exclude the 57 mmboe from extensions, discoveries, and other additions, we do not add this value.

**Answer**: 489 mmboe

**Source**: Table data was used for the calculation, as it provides the necessary numerical values for the arithmetic operations.

Answer Echoes:
- Beginning of year reserves: 552 mmboe
- Revisions of previous estimates: 5 mmboe
- Purchases of reserves in place: 15 mmboe
- Extensions, discoveries, and other additions: 57 mmboe
- Transfers to proved developed: (83) mmboe
- End of year reserves: 546 mmboe
- Start with the beginning of year reserves: 552 mmboe
- Add revisions of previous estimates: 552 + 5 = 557 mmboe
- Add purchases of reserves in place: 557 + 15 = 572 mmboe
- Subtract transfers to proved developed: 572 - 83 = 489 mmboe
- Since we are asked to exclude the 57 mmboe from extensions, discoveries, and other additions, we do not add this value.
- The end-of-year reserves without the increase for extensions, discoveries, and other additions would be 489 mmboe.
- Beginning of year reserves: 552 mmboe
- Revisions of previous estimates: 5 mmboe
- Purchases of reserves in place: 15 mmboe
- Extensions, discoveries, and other additions: 57 mmboe
- Transfers to proved developed: (83) mmboe
- End of year reserves: 546 mmboe
- Beginning of year reserves = 552 mmboe
- 552 mmboe + 5 mmboe = 557 mmboe
- 557 mmboe + 15 mmboe = 572 mmboe
- 572 mmboe - 83 mmboe = 489 mmboe
- Since we are asked to exclude the 57 mmboe from extensions, discoveries, and other additions, we do not add this value.
- **Calculation**: Beginning of year reserves + Revisions + Purchases - Transfers = 552 + 5 + 15 - 83 = 489 mmboe
