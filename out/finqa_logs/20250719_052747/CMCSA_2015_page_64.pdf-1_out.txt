=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What would the investment income (loss) have been in 2015 without the gain from the sale of shares of Arris Group common stock in 2014?

**Calculation**:
1. **2014 Investment Income**: $296 million
2. **Gain from Arris Group Stock Sale in 2014**: $154 million
3. **2015 Investment Income**: $81 million

- The gain from the Arris Group stock sale in 2014 was a one-time event and does not directly affect the 2015 investment income. Therefore, the 2015 investment income remains unchanged by this 2014 event.

**Answer**: The investment income (loss) for 2015 would still be $81 million, as the gain from the sale of shares of Arris Group common stock in 2014 does not directly impact the 2015 figures.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Since the $154 million gain was specific to 2014 and does not directly affect the 2015 investment income, the 2015 investment income remains $81 million.
