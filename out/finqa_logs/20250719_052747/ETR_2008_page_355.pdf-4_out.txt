=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the percent change in gas customers between 2007 and 2008?

**Calculation**:
1. **Extract Data from Text Context**:
   - Number of gas customers as of December 31, 2007: 86000
   - Number of gas customers as of December 31, 2008: 93000

2. **Determine the Change in Number of Gas Customers**:
   \[
   \text{Change in gas customers} = \text{Gas customers in 2008} - \text{Gas customers in 2007} = 93000 - 86000 = 7000
   \]

3. **Calculate the Percent Change**:
   \[
   \text{Percent change} = \left( \frac{\text{Change in gas customers}}{\text{Gas customers in 2007}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percent change} = \left( \frac{7000}{86000} \right) \times 100 \approx 8.14\%
   \]

**Answer**: The percent change in gas customers between 2007 and 2008 is approximately 8.14%.

**Source**: Combined analysis using text context for customer numbers.

Answer Echoes:
- 2007 net revenue: $231.0 million
- 2008 net revenue: $252.7 million
- Number of gas customers as of December 31, 2007: 86,000
- Number of gas customers as of December 31, 2008: 93,000
- 2007 gas customers: 86,000
- 2008 gas customers: 93,000
- Change in gas customers = 7,000
- Percent change = \( \frac{7,000}{86,000} \times 100 \approx 8.14\% \)
