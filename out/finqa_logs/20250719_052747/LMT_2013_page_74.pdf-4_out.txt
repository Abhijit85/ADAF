=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the change in the weighted average common shares outstanding for diluted computations from 2012 to 2013, in millions?

**Calculation**:
1. Identify the values from the table:
   - Weighted average common shares outstanding for diluted computations in 2013: 326.5 million
   - Weighted average common shares outstanding for diluted computations in 2012: 328.4 million

2. Calculate the difference:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 326.5 - 328.4 = -1.9
   \]

3. The result is negative, indicating a decrease.

**Answer**: The change in the weighted average common shares outstanding for diluted computations from 2012 to 2013 was a decrease of 1.9 million shares.

**Source**: Table data.

Answer Echoes:
- Weighted average common shares outstanding for diluted computations in 2013: 326.5 million
- Weighted average common shares outstanding for diluted computations in 2012: 328.4 million
- **Arithmetic Type**: Difference
- **Data Requirements**: Weighted average common shares outstanding for diluted computations in 2012 and 2013
- **Context Needs**: None beyond the table data
- **Calculation Steps**: Simple subtraction to find the difference
- **Exact Numbers**:
- Weighted average common shares outstanding for diluted computations in 2013: 326.5 million
- Weighted average common shares outstanding for diluted computations in 2012: 328.4 million
- 2013: 326.5 million shares
- 2012: 328.4 million shares
- 2013: 326.5 million shares
- 2012: 328.4 million shares
- Difference = 326.5 million - 328.4 million = -1.9 million
