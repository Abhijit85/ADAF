=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the percent of the debt maturities outstanding at December 31, 2013, that was unsecured debt?

**Calculation**:
1. **Data Extraction**:
   - Total Debt Outstanding: $4.3 billion
   - Unsecured Debt: $3.1 billion

2. **Percentage Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of Unsecured Debt} = \left( \frac{\text{Unsecured Debt}}{\text{Total Debt}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage of Unsecured Debt} = \left( \frac{3.1 \text{ billion}}{4.3 \text{ billion}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage of Unsecured Debt} \approx 72.09\%
   \]

**Answer**: Approximately 72.09% of the debt maturities outstanding at December 31, 2013, was unsecured debt.
