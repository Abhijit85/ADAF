=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What are the annual other sinking fund requirements as a percentage of annual long-term debt maturities (excluding lease obligations) and annual cash sinking fund requirements for debt outstanding in 2007?

**Calculation**:
1. **Annual Other Sinking Fund Requirements**: $30.2 million (as provided in the text context).
2. **Annual Long-term Debt Maturities (Excluding Lease Obligations)**: Not provided in the table or text.
3. **Annual Cash Sinking Fund Requirements**: Not provided in the table or text.

Since the specific figures for annual long-term debt maturities (excluding lease obligations) and annual cash sinking fund requirements for 2007 are not available, we cannot perform the calculation to determine the percentage of annual other sinking fund requirements relative to these figures.

**Answer**: Unable to calculate the percentage due to missing data on annual long-term debt maturities (excluding lease obligations) and annual cash sinking fund requirements for 2007.

**Source**: Combined analysis of table and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Annual other sinking fund requirements for 2007.
- Annual long-term debt maturities for 2007 (excluding lease obligations).
- Annual cash sinking fund requirements for 2007.
- The table provides total financial figures for each year but does not specify the breakdown of these figures into the required components.
- The table lacks specific data on long-term debt maturities, lease obligations, and sinking fund requirements.
- Without these specific figures, we cannot perform the calculation directly from the table.
- **Annual Other Sinking Fund Requirements**: $30.2 million annually (as mentioned in the financial context).
- The table does not provide specific figures for annual long-term debt maturities or annual cash sinking fund requirements for 2007.
- Annual long-term debt maturities (excluding lease obligations) for 2007.
- Annual cash sinking fund requirements for 2007.
