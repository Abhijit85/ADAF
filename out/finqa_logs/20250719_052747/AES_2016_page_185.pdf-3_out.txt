=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: As of December 31, 2015, what was the maximum premium on the DP&L preferred stock?

**Calculation**:
1. **Determine Redemption Value**: 
   - From the text, the redemption value of the DP&L preferred stock was adjusted to $23 million in September 2016.

2. **Book Value**:
   - From the table, the DP&L preferred stock for 2015 was valued at $18 million.

3. **Calculate Premium**:
   - Premium = Redemption Value - Book Value
   - Premium = $23 million - $18 million = $5 million

**Answer**: The maximum premium on the DP&L preferred stock as of December 31, 2015, was $5 million.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- DP&L preferred stock for 2015: $18
- Total redeemable stock of subsidiaries for 2015: $538
- **DP&L preferred stock for 2015**: $18 million
- **Total redeemable stock of subsidiaries for 2015**: $538 million
- The DP&L preferred stock was redeemable at per-share redemption prices between $101 and $103 per share, plus cumulative preferred dividends.
- In September 2016, the company recorded an adjustment of $5 million to retained earnings to adjust the preferred shares to their redemption value of $23 million.
- The text mentions that the redemption value of the DP&L preferred stock was adjusted to $23 million in September 2016. This suggests that the redemption value was higher than the book value of $18 million at the end of 2015.
- The premium is the difference between the redemption value and the book value.
- Premium = Redemption Value - Book Value
- Premium = $23 million - $18 million = $5 million
- DP&L preferred stock for 2015: $18 million (from table)
- Redemption value adjusted to $23 million (from text)
- Premium = $23 million - $18 million = $5 million
