=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the percentage change in revenues from 2016 to 2017 for transactions with related parties?

**Calculation**:
Given the lack of explicit data on "transactions with related parties," we assume "Revenue—Non-Regulated" is the closest available category for this calculation. Here are the steps:

1. **Identify Revenue Figures**:
   - Revenue for 2016: $1100 million
   - Revenue for 2017: $1297 million

2. **Calculate the Change in Revenue**:
   \[
   \text{Change in Revenue} = \text{Revenue in 2017} - \text{Revenue in 2016} = 1297 - 1100 = 197 \text{ million}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Percentage Change**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Change} = \left(\frac{\text{Change in Revenue}}{\text{Revenue in 2016}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{197}{1100}\right) \times 100
   \]

4. **Perform the Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Change} = \left(\frac{197}{1100}\right) \times 100 \approx 17.91\%
   \]

**Answer**: 17.91%

**Source**: Combined analysis using table data for "Revenue—Non-Regulated" as a proxy for "transactions with related parties" due to lack of specific data.

Answer Echoes:
- Revenue for 2016: $1,100
- Revenue for 2017: $1,297
- **Revenue for 2016 (Non-Regulated)**: $1,100 million
- **Revenue for 2017 (Non-Regulated)**: $1,297 million
