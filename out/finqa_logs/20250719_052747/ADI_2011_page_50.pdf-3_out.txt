=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What would the amount accrued because of interest on the term loan facility after October 29, 2011?

**Calculation**:
1. **Determine the Total Interest Rate**:
   - LIBOR Rate: 0.36%
   - Spread: 1.25%
   - Total Interest Rate = LIBOR + Spread = 0.36% + 1.25% = 1.61%

2. **Calculate Annual Interest Expense**:
   - Principal Amount = $145 million
   - Annual Interest Rate = 1.61%
   - Annual Interest Expense = Principal Amount × Annual Interest Rate
   - Annual Interest Expense = $145000000 × 0.0161 = $2334500

**Answer**: The amount accrued because of interest on the term loan facility after October 29, 2011, is $2334500 annually.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context.

Answer Echoes:
- **Principal Amount of Term Loan Facility**: $145 million
- **Interest Rate on Term Loan Facility**: LIBOR + 1.25%
- **LIBOR Rate as of October 29, 2011**: 0.36% (since the total rate is 1.61% and the spread is 1.25%)
- LIBOR Rate: 0.36%
- Spread: 1.25%
- Total Interest Rate = LIBOR + Spread = 0.36% + 1.25% = 1.61%
- Principal Amount = $145 million
- Annual Interest Rate = 1.61%
- Annual Interest Expense = Principal Amount × Annual Interest Rate
- Annual Interest Expense = $145,000,000 × 0.0161 = $2,334,500
- Principal Amount: $145 million
- Interest Rate: 1.61% (LIBOR + 1.25%)
- Total Interest Rate = 1.61%
- Annual Interest Expense = $145,000,000 × 0.0161 = $2,334,500
