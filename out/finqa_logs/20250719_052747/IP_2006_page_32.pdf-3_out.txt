Answer Echoes:
- 2005 Sales: $2,245 million
- 2006 Sales: $2,455 million
- Difference = 2006 Sales - 2005 Sales
- Difference = $2,455 million - $2,245 million = $210 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2005 Sales) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($210 million / $2,245 million) × 100
- Percentage Change = (210 / 2,245) × 100 ≈ 9.35%
- Shorewood net sales in 2006: $670 million
- Shorewood net sales in 2005: $691 million
- 2005 Sales: $691 million
- 2006 Sales: $670 million
- Difference = 2005 Sales - 2006 Sales
- Difference = $691 million - $670 million = $21 million
- Percentage Reduction = (Difference / 2005 Sales) × 100
- Percentage Reduction = ($21 million / $691 million) × 100
- Percentage Reduction = (21 / 691) × 100 ≈ 3.04%
- Difference = $691 million - $670 million = $21 million
- Percentage Reduction = (21 / 691) × 100 ≈ 3.04%
