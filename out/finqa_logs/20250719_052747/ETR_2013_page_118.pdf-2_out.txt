=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What amount of long-term debt is due in the next 36 months for Entergy Corporation as of December 31, 2013, in millions?

**Calculation**: 
1. **Identify Required Data**: We need the amounts of long-term debt maturing in 2014, 2015, and 2016 to cover the next 36 months from December 31, 2013.
2. **Extract from Table**: The table data provided does not contain specific amounts for these years.
3. **Supplement from Text**: The text does not provide explicit amounts for these years either.
4. **Assumptions**: In the absence of specific data, we assume typical financial reporting would list debt maturities for each year. However, without actual figures, we cannot perform a precise calculation.
5. **Perform Calculations**: Assuming hypothetical values for illustration (as actual values are not provided):
   - Debt due in 2014: $X million
   - Debt due in 2015: $Y million
   - Debt due in 2016: $Z million
   - Total debt due in next 36 months = $X + $Y + $Z million

**Answer**: Additional context is required to provide an accurate answer. Specific debt maturity amounts for 2014, 2015, and 2016 are needed to calculate the total long-term debt due in the next 36 months from December 31, 2013.

**Source**: Combined analysis of table and text, but specific data is missing.

Answer Echoes:
- The text mentions various obligations and notes, including those related to nuclear waste disposal and purchases of power plants. However, specific amounts of long-term debt due in the next 36 months are not directly provided in the text.
- The table data is noted to contain amounts for the years 2014 to 2018, but it does not directly relate to the question asked about the debt due in the next 36 months from December 31, 2013.
- Debt due in 2014: $X million
- Debt due in 2015: $Y million
- Debt due in 2016: $Z million
- Total debt due in next 36 months = $X + $Y + $Z million
- Specific amounts of long-term debt maturing in 2014, 2015, and 2016 are needed to provide an accurate answer. This information might be found in detailed financial statements or notes not provided here.
