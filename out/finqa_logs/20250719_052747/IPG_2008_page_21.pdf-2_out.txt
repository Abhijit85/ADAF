=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the total cash outflow for the repurchase of shares in the last three months of 2008?

**Calculation**:
1. **October Cash Outflow**:
   - Total Number of Shares Purchased: 29704
   - Average Price Paid per Share: $5.99
   - Cash Outflow for October = 29704 shares × $5.99/share = $177947.96

2. **November Cash Outflow**:
   - Total Number of Shares Purchased: 4468
   - Average Price Paid per Share: $3.24
   - Cash Outflow for November = 4468 shares × $3.24/share = $14482.32

3. **December Cash Outflow**:
   - Total Number of Shares Purchased: 12850
   - Average Price Paid per Share: $3.98
   - Cash Outflow for December = 12850 shares × $3.98/share = $51173.00

4. **Total Cash Outflow for the Quarter**:
   - Total Cash Outflow = October Cash Outflow + November Cash Outflow + December Cash Outflow
   - Total Cash Outflow = $177947.96 + $14482.32 + $51173.00 = $243603.28

**Answer**: The total cash outflow for the repurchase of shares in the last three months of 2008 is $243603.28.

- Average Price Paid per Share: $3.98
- Cash Outflow for December = 12,850 shares × $3.98/share = $51,173.00
- Total Cash Outflow = October Cash Outflow + November Cash Outflow + December Cash Outflow
- Total Cash Outflow = $177,947.96 + $14,482.32 + $51,173.00 = $243,603.28
- October Cash Outflow:
- Total Number of Shares Purchased: 29,704
