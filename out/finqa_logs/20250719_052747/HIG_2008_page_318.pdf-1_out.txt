=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In 2008, what was the percent of the total GAAP stockholders' equity and aggregate statutory capital associated with life operations?

**Calculation**:
1. **Extract Data**:
   - GAAP Stockholders' Equity (2008): $9.3 billion
   - Aggregate Statutory Capital and Surplus (2008): $13.8 billion
   - Life Operations Surplus (2008): $6047 million

2. **Convert Units**:
   - Life Operations Surplus: $6047 million = $6.047 billion

3. **Calculate Total GAAP and Statutory Capital**:
   - Total = GAAP Stockholders' Equity + Aggregate Statutory Capital
   - Total = $9.3 billion + $13.8 billion = $23.1 billion

4. **Calculate Percentage**:
   - Percentage = (Life Operations Surplus / Total GAAP and Statutory Capital) × 100
   - Percentage = ($6.047 billion / $23.1 billion) × 100
   - Percentage ≈ 0.2617 × 100
   - Percentage ≈ 26.17%

**Answer**: 26.17% of the total GAAP stockholders' equity and aggregate statutory capital was associated with life operations in 2008.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Total for 2008 = $13,777 million
- Life Operations for 2008 = $6,047 million
- Calculation: \((6,047 / 13,777) \times 100\)
- \((6,047 / 13,777) \approx 0.439\)
- \(0.439 \times 100 = 43.9\%\)
- From the text: The company's stockholders' equity, as prepared using U.S. GAAP, was $9.3 billion as of December 31, 2008.
- From the text: The company's estimated aggregate statutory capital and surplus, as prepared in accordance with the NAIC accounting practices, was $13.8 billion as of December 31, 2008.
- From the table data: Life Operations for 2008 = $6,047 million.
- Total = GAAP Stockholders' Equity + Aggregate Statutory Capital
- Total = $9.3 billion + $13.8 billion = $23.1 billion
- Percentage = (Life Operations Surplus / Total GAAP and Statutory Capital) × 100
- Percentage = ($6,047 million / $23,100 million) × 100
- Convert $6,047 million to billion: $6.047 billion
- Percentage = ($6.047 billion / $23.1 billion) × 100
- Percentage ≈ 0.2617 × 100
- Percentage ≈ 26.17%
- GAAP Stockholders' Equity: $9.3 billion
- Aggregate Statutory Capital: $13.8 billion
- Life Operations Surplus: $6,047 million
- Total GAAP and Statutory Capital = $23.1 billion
- Percentage = ($6.047 billion / $23.1 billion) × 100 ≈ 26.17%
