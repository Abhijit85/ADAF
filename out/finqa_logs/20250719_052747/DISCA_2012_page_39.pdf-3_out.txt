=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What were 2012 total consolidated revenues in millions?

**Calculation**:
1. From the text context, we know:
   - International networks generated revenues of $1637 million, representing 37% of the total consolidated revenues.
   - Education generated revenues of $105 million, representing 2% of the total consolidated revenues.

2. Calculate total consolidated revenues using the international networks data:
   \[
   \text{Total Consolidated Revenues} \times 0.37 = 1637
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Consolidated Revenues} = \frac{1637}{0.37} \approx 4424.32
   \]

3. Validate using the education segment data:
   \[
   \text{Total Consolidated Revenues} \times 0.02 = 105
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Consolidated Revenues} = \frac{105}{0.02} = 5250
   \]

4. Reconciliation:
   - The calculation using the international networks data is more likely to be accurate due to its larger share of the total revenues.

**Answer**: The 2012 total consolidated revenues were approximately $4424 million.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context.

Answer Echoes:
- The text states: "international networks generated revenues of $1637 million during 2012, which represented 37% of our total consolidated revenues."
- It also mentions: "education generated revenues of $105 million during 2012, which represented 2% of our total consolidated revenues."
- We know that international networks' revenue ($1637 million) represents 37% of the total consolidated revenues.
- Using the formula for percentage, we can set up the equation:
- Solving for Total Consolidated Revenues:
- Education's revenue ($105 million) represents 2% of the total consolidated revenues.
- Using the percentage formula again:
- Solving for Total Consolidated Revenues:
- International Networks Revenue: $1637 million (37% of total)
- Education Revenue: $105 million (2% of total)
- Total Consolidated Revenues = $1637 million / 0.37 = $4424.32 million
