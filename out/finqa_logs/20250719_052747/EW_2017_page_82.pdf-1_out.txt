=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What percentage of the total purchase price net of cash acquired is goodwill?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base**: The base is the "Total purchase price, net of cash acquired," which is $182.2 million.
2. **Identify Part**: The part we are interested in is "Goodwill," which is $142.1 million.
3. **Calculate Percentage**: 
   \[
   \text{Percentage of Goodwill} = \left(\frac{\text{Goodwill}}{\text{Total purchase price, net of cash acquired}}\right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage of Goodwill} = \left(\frac{142.1}{182.2}\right) \times 100
   \]
4. **Perform Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of Goodwill} = 0.7809 \times 100 = 78.09\%
   \]

**Answer**: 78.09%

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context. The table provided the exact numerical values needed for the calculation, while the text context confirmed the nature of the acquisition and the role of goodwill.

Answer Echoes:
- **Total purchase price, net of cash acquired**: $182.2 million
- **Goodwill**: $142.1 million
- The text context provides additional background on the acquisition and the nature of goodwill, but the specific numbers needed for the calculation are directly from the table data.
- Total purchase price, net of cash acquired: $182.2 million
- Goodwill: $142.1 million
- Calculate the percentage of goodwill as a part of the total purchase price net of cash acquired.
