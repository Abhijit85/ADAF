=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In millions, what was the change in the estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected between December 2017 and December 2016?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Values**:
   - December 2017 Sensitivity: $35 million
   - December 2016 Sensitivity: $25 million

2. **Calculate the Change**:
   - Change = 2017 Sensitivity - 2016 Sensitivity
   - Change = $35 million - $25 million

3. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - Change = $10 million

**Answer**: The change in the estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected between December 2017 and December 2016 was $10 million.

**Source**: Text Context (as the table did not provide the necessary data)

Answer Echoes:
- **December 2017 Sensitivity**: The estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in our own credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected was a gain of $35 million.
- **December 2016 Sensitivity**: The estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in our own credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected was a gain of $25 million.
- 2017 Sensitivity: $35 million
- 2016 Sensitivity: $25 million
- Change = 2017 Sensitivity - 2016 Sensitivity
- Change = $35 million - $25 million
- Change = $10 million
- December 2017 Sensitivity: $35 million
- December 2016 Sensitivity: $25 million
- Change = $35 million - $25 million = $10 million
