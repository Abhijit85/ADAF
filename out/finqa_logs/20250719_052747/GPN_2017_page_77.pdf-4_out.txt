=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: How much money can the company deduct on the income tax in the future after this acquisition?

**Calculation**:
1. **Deferred Income Tax Assets (Liabilities)**: The table indicates a deferred income tax liability of \( (9788) \). This means the company will owe this amount in taxes in the future, rather than being able to deduct it.
2. **Goodwill**: The text states that the goodwill of $203.8 million is not deductible for income tax purposes.
3. **Amortization of Intangible Assets**: While the text provides amortization periods for customer-related intangible assets, acquired technology, and trade name, it does not specify any tax deduction values related to these assets.

**Answer**: The company cannot deduct any money on the income tax in the future from this acquisition based on the deferred tax liability of \( 9788 \) and the non-deductible nature of the goodwill.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- The table lists "Deferred income tax assets (liabilities)" as \( (9,788) \).
- The parentheses around \( 9,788 \) indicate that this is a liability, not an asset. In accounting, a deferred tax liability means that the company will owe this amount in taxes in the future, rather than being able to deduct it.
- Since the deferred income tax is a liability, it does not represent an amount that can be deducted from future taxes. Instead, it indicates an amount that will need to be paid in the future.
- **Deferred Income Tax Assets (Liabilities)**: \( (9,788) \)
- **Goodwill**: $203.8 million
- **Amortization Periods**:
- Customer-related intangible assets: 15 years
- Acquired technology: 15 years
- Trade name: 5 years
- **Goodwill Deductibility**: Not deductible for income tax purposes
- The deferred income tax value of \( (9,788) \) indicates a liability, meaning this amount will be owed in taxes in the future, not deducted.
- Goodwill of $203.8 million is not deductible for income tax purposes, so it does not contribute to future tax deductions.
- The amortization of customer-related intangible assets, acquired technology, and trade name could potentially affect tax calculations, but specific tax deduction values are not provided in the context.
- Based on the provided data, there is no indication of any deductible amount from the acquisition for future income taxes. The deferred tax liability of \( 9,788 \) suggests an obligation rather than a deduction.
- Deferred income tax liability: \( (9,788) \)
- Goodwill: $203.8 million (not deductible)
- Deferred tax liability indicates future tax payment, not deduction.
- Goodwill is not deductible.
