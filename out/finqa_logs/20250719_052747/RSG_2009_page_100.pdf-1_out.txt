=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In 2009, what was the change in the allowance for doubtful accounts?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Values**:
   - Balance at the beginning of 2009: $65.7 million
   - Balance at the end of 2009: $55.2 million

2. **Calculate the Change**:
   - Change = Balance at end of year - Balance at beginning of year
   - Change = $55.2 million - $65.7 million

3. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - Change = -$10.5 million

4. **Interpret the Result**:
   - The negative sign indicates a decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts.

**Answer**: The change in the allowance for doubtful accounts in 2009 was a decrease of $10.5 million.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Balance at the beginning of 2009: $65.7 million
- Balance at the end of 2009: $55.2 million
- Change = Balance at end of year - Balance at beginning of year
- Change = $55.2 million - $65.7 million
- Change = -$10.5 million
- The result is negative, indicating a decrease.
- From the table data provided, we have the following values:
- **Balance at the beginning of 2009**: $65.7 million
- **Balance at the end of 2009**: $55.2 million
- To find the change in the allowance for doubtful accounts, we subtract the balance at the beginning of the year from the balance at the end of the year.
- Change = Balance at end of year - Balance at beginning of year
- Change = $55.2 million - $65.7 million
- Change = -$10.5 million
- The negative sign indicates a decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts.
