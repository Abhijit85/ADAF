=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the percent of the purchase obligations in 2006 set aside for the contract for the purchase of pulpwood, logs, and wood chips?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base and Part**:
   - **Base**: Total purchase obligations in 2006 = $3264 million.
   - **Part**: Amount set aside for the contract for the purchase of pulpwood, logs, and wood chips = $2400 million.

2. **Calculate Percentage**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Base}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{2400}{3264}\right) \times 100
   \]

3. **Perform Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{2400}{3264}\right) \times 100 \approx 73.53\%
   \]

**Answer**: Approximately 73.53% of the purchase obligations in 2006 were set aside for the contract for the purchase of pulpwood, logs, and wood chips.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data (total purchase obligations) and text context (amount for pulpwood, logs, and wood chips).

Answer Echoes:
- **Base**: The total purchase obligations in 2006.
- **Part**: The portion of the purchase obligations in 2006 set aside for the contract for the purchase of pulpwood, logs, and wood chips.
- Total purchase obligations in 2006 = $3,264 million.
- Total purchase obligations in 2006 = $3,264 million.
- The text states: "The 2006 amount includes $2.4 billion for contracts made in the ordinary course of business to purchase pulpwood, logs, and wood chips."
- **Base**: Total purchase obligations in 2006 = $3,264 million.
- **Part**: Amount set aside for the contract for the purchase of pulpwood, logs, and wood chips = $2,400 million.
- Total purchase obligations in 2006 = $3,264 million (from table).
- Amount for pulpwood, logs, and wood chips = $2,400 million (from text).
- \((2,400 / 3,264) \times 100 = 73.53\%\)
