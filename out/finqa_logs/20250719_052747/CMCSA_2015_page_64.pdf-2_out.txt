=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What would the investment income (loss) have been in 2014 without the gain from the sale of the investment in Clearwire Corporation in 2013?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the 2014 Investment Income**: 
   - Investment income (loss), net for 2014 is $296 million.

2. **Determine the Impact of Clearwire Sale**:
   - The gain from the Clearwire sale in 2013 was $443 million.

3. **Calculate the 2014 Investment Income Without Clearwire Gain**:
   - Adjusted 2014 Investment Income = 2014 Investment Income - Clearwire Gain
   - Adjusted 2014 Investment Income = $296 million - $443 million

4. **Perform Calculation**:
   - Adjusted 2014 Investment Income = $296 million - $443 million = -$147 million

**Answer**: The investment income (loss) in 2014 would have been -$147 million without the gain from the sale of the investment in Clearwire Corporation in 2013.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- From the table, the investment income (loss), net for 2013 is $576 million.
- The problem implies that the 2013 investment income includes a gain from the sale of the investment in Clearwire Corporation. However, the exact amount of this gain is not provided in the table or the question.
- The investment income (loss), net for 2014 is $296 million.
- Without knowing the specific gain from Clearwire in 2013, we cannot directly adjust the 2014 figure.
- **Arithmetic Type**: Difference
- **Data Requirements**: Investment income (loss) for 2014, gain from Clearwire sale in 2013
- **Context Needs**: Impact of Clearwire sale on 2013 investment income
- The text states that the change in investment income (loss), net in 2014 was primarily due to a $443 million gain related to the sale of our investment in Clearwire Corporation in 2013.
- The investment income (loss), net for 2014 is $296 million.
- Investment income (loss), net for 2014 is $296 million.
- The gain from the Clearwire sale in 2013 was $443 million.
- Since the 2014 investment income was impacted by the Clearwire gain from 2013, we need to adjust the 2014 figure by removing this gain.
- Adjusted 2014 Investment Income = 2014 Investment Income - Clearwire Gain
- Adjusted 2014 Investment Income = $296 million - $443 million
- Adjusted 2014 Investment Income = $296 million - $443 million = -$147 million
- The result is reasonable given that the 2014 investment income was significantly impacted by the previous year's gain.
- 2014 Investment Income: $296 million
- Clearwire Gain in 2013: $443 million
- Adjusted 2014 Investment Income = $296 million - $443 million = -$147 million
