=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the average revenue from discontinued operations in 2013 and 2011, in millions?

**Calculation**:
1. Identify the revenue figures for the years 2013 and 2011 from the text context:
   - Revenue from discontinued operations in 2013: $503 million
   - Revenue from discontinued operations in 2011: $974 million

2. Calculate the total revenue for both years:
   - Total revenue = $503 million (2013) + $974 million (2011) = $1477 million

3. Calculate the average revenue over the two years:
   - Average revenue = Total revenue ÷ Number of years
   - Average revenue = $1477 million ÷ 2 = $738.5 million

**Answer**: The average revenue from discontinued operations in 2013 and 2011 is $738.5 million.

**Source**: Text context (revenue figures for 2013 and 2011).

Answer Echoes:
- The table provides figures for current and noncurrent assets, as well as current and long-term liabilities from discontinued operations, along with net assets for 2013.
- There is no direct mention of revenue figures for discontinued operations in 2013 or 2011.
- Revenue from discontinued operations in 2013: $503 million
- Revenue from discontinued operations in 2011: $974 million
- Add the revenues for 2013 and 2011: $503 million (2013) + $974 million (2011) = $1,477 million
- Divide by the number of years (2) to find the average: $1,477 million ÷ 2 = $738.5 million
