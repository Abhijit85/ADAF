=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: As of December 31, 2016, what percentage of manufacturing and processing facilities are owned?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base and Part**:
   - **Base (Total Facilities)**: Sum of owned and leased facilities.
   - **Part (Owned Facilities)**: Total number of owned facilities.

2. **Extract Numbers from the Table**:
   - **Owned Facilities**:
     - United States: 43
     - Canada: 3
     - Europe: 11
     - Rest of World: 26
     - **Total Owned** = 43 + 3 + 11 + 26 = 83

   - **Leased Facilities**:
     - United States: 2
     - Canada: 0
     - Europe: 0
     - Rest of World: 2
     - **Total Leased** = 2 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 4

   - **Total Facilities**: Owned + Leased = 83 + 4 = 87

3. **Calculate the Percentage of Owned Facilities**:
   - Formula: \((\text{Owned} / \text{Total}) \times 100\)
   - Calculation: \((83 / 87) \times 100\)

4. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - \((83 / 87) \times 100 \approx 95.40\%\)

**Answer**: 95.40% of the manufacturing and processing facilities are owned as of December 31, 2016.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data.

Answer Echoes:
- **Base (Total Facilities)**: This is the sum of all owned and leased facilities.
- **Part (Owned Facilities)**: This is the total number of owned facilities.
- **Owned Facilities**:
- United States: 43
- Canada: 3
- Europe: 11
- Rest of World: 26
- Total Owned = 43 + 3 + 11 + 26 = 83
- **Leased Facilities**:
- United States: 2
- Canada: 0 (represented by '—')
- Europe: 0 (represented by '—')
- Rest of World: 2
- Total Leased = 2 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 4
- **Total Facilities**: Owned + Leased = 83 + 4 = 87
- **Percentage of Owned Facilities** = (Owned / Total) × 100
- **Calculation**: (83 / 87) × 100
- **Calculation**: (83 / 87) × 100 ≈ 95.40%
- **Owned Facilities**:
- United States: 43
- Canada: 3
- Europe: 11
- Rest of World: 26
- **Total Owned** = 43 + 3 + 11 + 26 = 83
- **Leased Facilities**:
- United States: 2
- Canada: 0
- Europe: 0
- Rest of World: 2
- **Total Leased** = 2 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 4
- **Total Facilities**: Owned + Leased = 83 + 4 = 87
- **Base (Total Facilities)**: 87
- **Part (Owned Facilities)**: 83
- Formula: \((\text{Owned} / \text{Total}) \times 100\)
- Calculation: \((83 / 87) \times 100\)
- \((83 / 87) \times 100 \approx 95.40\%\)
