=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What are the lease obligations to Entergy Louisiana as a percentage of long-term debt maturities in 2014?

**Calculation**: 
1. **Lease Obligations**: From the text context, we know that the lease obligations to Entergy Louisiana are $149 million.
2. **Long-term Debt Maturities**: The specific figure for long-term debt maturities in 2014 is not provided in either the table or the text context.
3. **Percentage Calculation**: The formula to calculate the percentage is (Lease Obligations / Long-term Debt Maturities) * 100. However, without the long-term debt maturities figure, this calculation cannot be completed.

**Answer**: Unable to calculate the percentage due to missing data on long-term debt maturities for 2014.

**Source**: Combined analysis of text context and table data.

Answer Echoes:
- The base should be the long-term debt maturities in 2014.
- The part should be the lease obligations to Entergy Louisiana in 2014.
- The table provides only total amounts for each year, not specific figures for lease obligations or long-term debt maturities.
- Without specific figures for lease obligations and long-term debt maturities, it's impossible to perform the calculation.
- **Arithmetic Type**: Percentage calculation
- **Data Requirements**: Lease obligations to Entergy Louisiana and long-term debt maturities for 2014
- **Context Needs**: Specific figures for lease obligations and long-term debt maturities
