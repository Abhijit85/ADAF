=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: If the HR solutions segment generated 35% of the consolidated revenue, what would be the total revenue for 2014, in millions?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Percentage and Part**:
   - HR solutions segment revenue is 35% of the total revenue.

2. **Extract the Known Value**:
   - HR solutions segment revenue for 2014 is $4264 million.

3. **Set Up the Equation**:
   - Let \( X \) be the total revenue for 2014.
   - According to the problem, 35% of \( X \) is equal to the HR solutions segment revenue.
   - Therefore, the equation is: 
     \[
     0.35 \times X = 4264
     \]

4. **Solve for \( X \)**:
   \[
   X = \frac{4264}{0.35}
   \]

5. **Perform the Calculation**:
   \[
   X = 12182.8571
   \]

6. **Round to the Nearest Whole Number**:
   - Since financial figures are typically rounded to the nearest whole number, the total revenue for 2014 is approximately $12183 million.

**Answer**: $12183 million

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- HR solutions segment revenue is 35% of the total revenue.
- Total revenue for 2014 is represented as $4,264 million.
- Let \( X \) be the total revenue for 2014.
- According to the problem, 35% of \( X \) is equal to the HR solutions segment revenue.
- Therefore, \( 0.35 \times X = 4,264 \).
- Since financial figures are typically rounded to the nearest whole number, the total revenue for 2014 is approximately $12,183 million.
- **From Table Data**: The HR solutions segment revenue is 35% of the total revenue.
- **From Text Context**: The total revenue for 2014 is represented as $4,264 million for the HR solutions segment.
- Let \( X \) be the total revenue for 2014.
- According to the problem, 35% of \( X \) is equal to the HR solutions segment revenue.
- Therefore, the equation is:
- Since financial figures are typically rounded to the nearest whole number, the total revenue for 2014 is approximately $12,183 million.
- The calculation is consistent with the given percentage and the known revenue for the HR solutions segment.
