=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the change in receivables for recoverable costs from certain states, under programs to assist companies in clean-up efforts related to underground storage tanks between December 31, 2009, and 2008, in millions?

**Calculation**:
1. Identify the receivables for recoverable costs at the end of each year:
   - Receivables at December 31, 2009: $59 million
   - Receivables at December 31, 2008: $60 million

2. Calculate the change in receivables:
   \[
   \text{Change in Receivables} = \text{Receivables at 2009} - \text{Receivables at 2008}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Change in Receivables} = 59 \, \text{million} - 60 \, \text{million} = -1 \, \text{million}
   \]

**Answer**: The change in receivables for recoverable costs from certain states between December 31, 2009, and 2008, was a decrease of $1 million.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Receivables for recoverable costs at December 31, 2009: $59 million
- Receivables for recoverable costs at December 31, 2008: $60 million
