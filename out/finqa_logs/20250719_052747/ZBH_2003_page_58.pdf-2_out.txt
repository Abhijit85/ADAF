=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the change in finished goods in millions between 2002 and 2003?

**Calculation**:
1. Identify the values for finished goods from the table:
   - Finished goods in 2003: $384.3 million
   - Finished goods in 2002: $206.7 million

2. Calculate the difference:
   - Change in finished goods = Finished goods in 2003 - Finished goods in 2002
   - Calculation: $384.3 million - $206.7 million

3. Perform the arithmetic operation:
   - $384.3 million - $206.7 million = $177.6 million

**Answer**: The change in finished goods between 2002 and 2003 is $177.6 million.

**Source**: Table data was used for the exact numerical values, ensuring reliability and precision in the calculation.

Answer Echoes:
- Finished goods in 2003: $384.3 million
- Finished goods in 2002: $206.7 million
- Change in finished goods = Finished goods in 2003 - Finished goods in 2002
- Calculation: $384.3 million - $206.7 million
- $384.3 million - $206.7 million = $177.6 million
- The change in finished goods is $177.6 million.
- **Finished goods in 2003**: $384.3 million
- **Finished goods in 2002**: $206.7 million
- Calculation: $384.3 million - $206.7 million
- Result: $384.3 million - $206.7 million = $177.6 million
