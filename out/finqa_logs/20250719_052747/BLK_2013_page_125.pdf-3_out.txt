=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the growth rate in rent expense and certain office equipment expense in 2013 compared to 2012?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Required Data**:
   - Rent and office equipment expense for 2012: $133 million
   - Rent and office equipment expense for 2013: $137 million

2. **Calculate the Difference**:
   - Difference = $137 million - $133 million = $4 million

3. **Calculate the Growth Rate**:
   \[
   \text{Growth Rate} = \left(\frac{\text{Difference}}{\text{2012 Value}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{4}{133}\right) \times 100 \approx 3.01\%
   \]

**Answer**: The growth rate in rent expense and certain office equipment expense in 2013 compared to 2012 is approximately 3.01%.

**Source**: Text context (as the table did not provide data for 2012 and 2013).

Answer Echoes:
- **Arithmetic Type**: Percentage growth rate
- **Data Requirements**: Rent expense and office equipment expense for 2012 and 2013
- **Context Needs**: Extract relevant data from the provided financial context
- Rent expense and certain office equipment expense amounted to $137 million in 2013.
- Rent expense and certain office equipment expense amounted to $133 million in 2012.
- 2013 Rent and Office Equipment Expense = $137 million
- 2012 Rent and Office Equipment Expense = $133 million
- Calculate the difference: $137 million - $133 million = $4 million
- Calculate the growth rate:
- The calculation appears reasonable given the context and data provided.
- Present the result with appropriate precision.
- Difference = $137 million - $133 million = $4 million
- Growth Rate = \((\frac{4}{133}) \times 100 \approx 3.01\%\)
