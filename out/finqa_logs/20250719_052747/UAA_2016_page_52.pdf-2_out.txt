=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the operating margin for Connected Fitness in 2014?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Operating Income and Revenue**:
   - Operating Income (2014): \(-\$13.1\) million
   - Revenue (2014): \$19.2 million

2. **Calculate Operating Margin**:
   \[
   \text{Operating Margin} = \left( \frac{\text{Operating Income}}{\text{Revenue}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Operating Margin} = \left( \frac{-13.1}{19.2} \right) \times 100
   \]

3. **Perform Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Operating Margin} = \left( \frac{-13.1}{19.2} \right) \times 100 \approx -68.23\%
   \]

**Answer**: The operating margin for Connected Fitness in 2014 was approximately \(-68.23\%\).

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- 2014 Operating Income for Connected Fitness: \(-\$13.1\) million (or \(-\$13,064\) thousand as mentioned in the table data).
- 2014 Revenue for Connected Fitness: \$19.2 million.
- Operating Income (2014): \(-\$13.1\) million
- Revenue (2014): \$19.2 million
