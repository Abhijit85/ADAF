=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What percent higher is the average VaR for foreign exchange products than that of interest rate products?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base and Part**:
   - Base: Average VaR for interest rate products = $1.1 million
   - Part: Average VaR for foreign exchange products = $1.8 million

2. **Calculate the Difference**:
   - Difference = $1.8 million - $1.1 million = $0.7 million

3. **Calculate the Percentage Increase**:
   - Percentage increase = (Difference / Average VaR for interest rate products) × 100
   - Percentage increase = ($0.7 million / $1.1 million) × 100
   - Percentage increase = 0.63636 × 100 ≈ 63.64%

**Answer**: The average VaR for foreign exchange products is approximately 63.64% higher than that of interest rate products.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- **Base**: Average VaR for interest rate products in 2008 = $1.1 million
- **Part**: Average VaR for foreign exchange products in 2008 = $1.8 million
- Difference = Average VaR for foreign exchange products - Average VaR for interest rate products
- Difference = $1.8 million - $1.1 million = $0.7 million
- Percentage increase = (Difference / Average VaR for interest rate products) × 100
- Percentage increase = ($0.7 million / $1.1 million) × 100
- Percentage increase = 0.63636 × 100 ≈ 63.64%
- **Average VaR for interest rate products in 2008**: $1.1 million
- **Average VaR for foreign exchange products in 2008**: $1.8 million
- **Base**: Average VaR for interest rate products = $1.1 million
- **Part**: Average VaR for foreign exchange products = $1.8 million
- Difference = Average VaR for foreign exchange products - Average VaR for interest rate products
- Difference = $1.8 million - $1.1 million = $0.7 million
- Percentage increase = (Difference / Average VaR for interest rate products) × 100
- Percentage increase = ($0.7 million / $1.1 million) × 100
- Percentage increase = 0.63636 × 100 ≈ 63.64%
- Average VaR for interest rate products = $1.1 million
- Average VaR for foreign exchange products = $1.8 million
- Difference = $1.8 million - $1.1 million = $0.7 million
- Percentage increase = ($0.7 million / $1.1 million) × 100 = 63.64%
