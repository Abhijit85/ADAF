=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: By how much did proved undeveloped reserves increase during 2017?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Positive Contributions**:
   - Revisions of previous estimates: 5 mmboe
   - Purchases of reserves in place: 15 mmboe
   - Extensions, discoveries, and other additions: 57 mmboe

2. **Sum of Positive Contributions**:
   - Total increase = 5 + 15 + 57 = 77 mmboe

**Answer**: The proved undeveloped reserves increased by 77 mmboe during 2017.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data.

Answer Echoes:
- Beginning of year reserves: 552
- End of year reserves: 546
- Revisions of previous estimates: 5
- Improved recovery: 0 (denoted by '—')
- Purchases of reserves in place: 15
- Extensions, discoveries, and other additions: 57
- Dispositions: 0 (denoted by '—')
- Transfers to proved developed: (83)
- Net change = Revisions + Improved recovery + Purchases + Extensions - Dispositions - Transfers
- Net change = 5 + 0 + 15 + 57 - 0 - 83
- Net change = 77 - 83
- Net change = -6
- Since the net change is negative, the reserves decreased by 6.
- However, the question asks for the increase, which implies we should consider the positive contributions.
- Positive contributions (ignoring transfers to developed): 5 (revisions) + 15 (purchases) + 57 (extensions) = 77
- Beginning of year reserves: 552 mmboe
- End of year reserves: 546 mmboe
- Revisions of previous estimates: 5 mmboe
- Improved recovery: 0 mmboe
- Purchases of reserves in place: 15 mmboe
- Extensions, discoveries, and other additions: 57 mmboe
- Dispositions: 0 mmboe
- Transfers to proved developed: (83) mmboe
- The text provides a narrative explanation of changes in reserves but does not provide additional numerical data beyond what is in the table.
- Net change = Revisions + Improved recovery + Purchases + Extensions - Dispositions - Transfers
- Net change = 5 + 0 + 15 + 57 - 0 - 83
- Net change = 77 - 83
- Net change = -6 mmboe
- The question asks for the increase, which implies focusing on the positive contributions to reserves.
- Positive contributions (ignoring transfers to developed): 5 (revisions) + 15 (purchases) + 57 (extensions) = 77 mmboe
- Extracted values from the table: Revisions (5 mmboe), Purchases (15 mmboe), Extensions (57 mmboe).
- Calculated the positive contributions to reserves: 5 + 15 + 57 = 77 mmboe.
