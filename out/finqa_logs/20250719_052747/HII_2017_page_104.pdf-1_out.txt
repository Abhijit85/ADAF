=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the percentage change in the unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the senior notes from 2016 to 2017?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Values**:
   - Unamortized debt issuance costs in 2016: $19 million
   - Unamortized debt issuance costs in 2017: $15 million

2. **Calculate the Change**:
   - Change in unamortized debt issuance costs = 2017 value - 2016 value
   - Change = $15 million - $19 million = -$4 million

3. **Calculate the Percentage Change**:
   - Percentage Change = (Change / 2016 value) × 100
   - Percentage Change = (-$4 million / $19 million) × 100

4. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - Percentage Change = (-0.210526) × 100 ≈ -21.05%

**Answer**: The percentage change in the unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the senior notes from 2016 to 2017 is approximately **-21.05%**.

**Source**: Combined analysis using text context for accurate data extraction.

Answer Echoes:
- Unamortized debt issuance costs in 2016: \( (27) \) million dollars
- Unamortized debt issuance costs in 2017: \( (26) \) million dollars
- Change in unamortized debt issuance costs = 2017 value - 2016 value
- Change = \( (26) - (27) = 1 \) million dollars
- Percentage Change = (Change / 2016 value) × 100
- Percentage Change = \( (1 / 27) \times 100 \)
- Percentage Change = \( 0.037037 \times 100 \approx 3.70\% \)
- **Unamortized debt issuance costs in 2016**: $19 million
- **Unamortized debt issuance costs in 2017**: $15 million
- Change in unamortized debt issuance costs = 2017 value - 2016 value
- Change = $15 million - $19 million = -$4 million
- Percentage Change = (Change / 2016 value) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-$4 million / $19 million) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-0.210526) × 100 ≈ -21.05%
- Change = $15 million - $19 million = -$4 million
- Percentage Change = (-$4 million / $19 million) × 100 ≈ -21.05%
