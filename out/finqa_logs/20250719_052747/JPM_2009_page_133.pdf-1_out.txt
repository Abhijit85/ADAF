=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: If there were a 200bp rise in rates, how much more would the impact be on earnings in 2009 vs. 2008?

**Calculation**:
1. **Extract Data from Table**:
   - Impact on earnings for a +200bp change in rates:
     - **2009:** $(1594) million
     - **2008:** $336 million

2. **Calculate the Difference**:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Impact in 2009} - \text{Impact in 2008}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = (-1594) - 336
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = -1594 - 336 = -1930
   \]

3. **Interpret the Result**:
   - The negative sign indicates that the impact on earnings in 2009 was more adverse compared to 2008.

**Answer**: The impact on earnings in 2009 was $1930 million more negative compared to 2008 for a 200bp rise in rates.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Impact on earnings for a +200bp change in rates:
- **2009:** $(1,594) million
- **2008:** $336 million
- The difference in impact on earnings between 2009 and 2008 for a +200bp change is calculated as follows:
- The negative sign indicates that the impact on earnings in 2009 was more adverse compared to 2008.
- Impact on earnings for a +200bp change in rates:
- **2009:** $(1,594) million
- **2008:** $336 million
- The difference in impact on earnings between 2009 and 2008 for a +200bp change is calculated as follows:
- The negative sign indicates that the impact on earnings in 2009 was more adverse compared to 2008.
- 2009 impact: $(1,594) million
- 2008 impact: $336 million
- Difference = \((-1,594) - 336 = -1,930\)
