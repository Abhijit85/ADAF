=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In 2009, what was the ratio of the commercial mortgages at fair value to lower of cost or market?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Components**: 
   - Commercial mortgages at fair value (2009): $1050 million
   - Commercial mortgages at lower of cost or market (2009): $251 million

2. **Calculate Ratio**:
   - Ratio = Commercial mortgages at fair value / Commercial mortgages at lower of cost or market
   - Ratio = $1050 million / $251 million

3. **Perform Division**:
   - Ratio = 1050 / 251 ≈ 4.18

**Answer**: 4.18

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context. 

This means that in 2009, the commercial mortgages at fair value were approximately 4.18 times the commercial mortgages at lower of cost or market.

Answer Echoes:
- Commercial mortgages at fair value (2009): $1,050 million
- Commercial mortgages at lower of cost or market (2009): $251 million
- Ratio = Commercial mortgages at fair value / Commercial mortgages at lower of cost or market
- Ratio = $1,050 million / $251 million
- Ratio = 1,050 / 251 ≈ 4.18
- Commercial mortgages at fair value (2009): $1,050 million
- Commercial mortgages at lower of cost or market (2009): $251 million
- Ratio = Commercial mortgages at fair value / Commercial mortgages at lower of cost or market
- Ratio = $1,050 million / $251 million
- Ratio = 1,050 / 251 ≈ 4.18
- Commercial mortgages at fair value: $1,050 million
- Commercial mortgages at lower of cost or market: $251 million
- Ratio = 1,050 / 251 = 4.18
