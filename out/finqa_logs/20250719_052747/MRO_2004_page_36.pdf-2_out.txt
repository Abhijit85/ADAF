=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What were total heavy fuel oil sales in tbd for the three-year period?

**Calculation**:
1. Extract values for heavy fuel oil sales from the table:
   - 2004: 27 tbd
   - 2003: 24 tbd
   - 2002: 20 tbd

2. Sum the values for the three-year period:
   - Total Heavy Fuel Oil Sales = 27 (2004) + 24 (2003) + 20 (2002)

3. Perform the addition:
   - Total = 27 + 24 + 20 = 71 tbd

**Answer**: Total Heavy Fuel Oil Sales for the three-year period: 71 tbd

**Source**: Table data

Answer Echoes:
- 2004: 27 tbd
- 2003: 24 tbd
- 2002: 20 tbd
- Total Heavy Fuel Oil Sales = 27 (2004) + 24 (2003) + 20 (2002)
- Total = 27 + 24 + 20 = 71 tbd
- **From Table**:
- Heavy Fuel Oil Sales for 2004: 27 tbd
- Heavy Fuel Oil Sales for 2003: 24 tbd
- Heavy Fuel Oil Sales for 2002: 20 tbd
- Total Heavy Fuel Oil Sales = 27 (2004) + 24 (2003) + 20 (2002)
- Total = 27 + 24 + 20 = 71 tbd
