**Calculation**:
1. **Distributions to Shareholders**:
   - Dividends Payable: $284 million

2. **Distributions to Debtholders**:
   - Interest Payable: $197 million

3. **Comparison**:
   - Compare $284 million (Dividends Payable) to $197 million (Interest Payable)

**Answer**: Yes, in 2011, the company distributed more to shareholders ($284 million) than to debtholders ($197 million).

**Source**: Table data

Answer Echoes:
- **Dividends Payable**: This represents the amount distributed to shareholders. From the table, the dividends payable for Dec. 31, 2011, is $284 million.
- **Interest Payable**: This represents the amount distributed to debtholders. From the table, the interest payable for Dec. 31, 2011, is $197 million.
- Dividends Payable (to shareholders) = $284 million
- Interest Payable (to debtholders) = $197 million
- $284 million (Dividends Payable) > $197 million (Interest Payable)
- **Distributions to Shareholders:**
- **Dividends Payable**: $284 million (Dec. 31, 2011)
- **Distributions to Debtholders:**
- **Interest Payable**: $197 million (Dec. 31, 2011)
- Dividends Payable (to shareholders) = $284 million
- Interest Payable (to debtholders) = $197 million
- $284 million (Dividends Payable) > $197 million (Interest Payable)
- Dividends Payable: $284 million (from table)
- Interest Payable: $197 million (from table)
- Compare $284 million (Dividends) to $197 million (Interest)
