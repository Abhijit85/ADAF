=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was JPMorgan Chase & Co's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio in 2008?

**Calculation**: 
To calculate the CET1 ratio, we need the formula:
\[ \text{CET1 Ratio} = \frac{\text{Common Equity Tier 1 Capital}}{\text{Risk-weighted Assets}} \]

From the table, we have:
- Risk-weighted Assets for 2008: $1244659 million
- Total Tier 1 Capital for 2008: $136104 million

However, the specific amount of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital is not provided in the table or the text context. The Total Tier 1 Capital includes CET1 but does not specify its exact portion. Without the exact CET1 amount, we cannot calculate the CET1 ratio.

**Answer**: Additional context required. The specific amount of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital is needed to calculate the CET1 ratio for 2008. The table and text do not provide this information directly.

**Source**: Combined analysis (table and text)

Answer Echoes:
- Risk-weighted assets for 2008: $1,244,659 million
- **CET1 Ratio Formula**: Common Equity Tier 1 Capital / Risk-weighted Assets
- **Table Data**:
- Risk-weighted Assets for 2008: $1,244,659 million
- Total Tier 1 Capital for 2008: $136,104 million
- **Missing Data**: Common Equity Tier 1 Capital is not directly provided.
