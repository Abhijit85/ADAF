=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the percent change in operating revenues from 2001 to 2002?

**Calculation**:
1. **Extract Data from Text**:
   - Operating revenues for 2002: $1.2 billion
   - Increase in operating revenues from 2001 to 2002: $411.0 million

2. **Calculate Operating Revenues for 2001**:
   \[
   \text{Operating Revenues for 2001} = \text{Operating Revenues for 2002} - \text{Increase from 2001 to 2002}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Operating Revenues for 2001} = 1200000000 - 411000000 = 789000000
   \]

3. **Calculate Percent Change**:
   \[
   \text{Percent Change} = \left( \frac{\text{Operating Revenues in 2002} - \text{Operating Revenues in 2001}}{\text{Operating Revenues in 2001}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percent Change} = \left( \frac{1200000000 - 789000000}{789000000} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percent Change} = \left( \frac{411000000}{789000000} \right) \times 100 \approx 52.09\%
   \]

**Answer**: The percent change in operating revenues from 2001 to 2002 is approximately 52.09%.

**Source**: Text Context (as the table did not provide the necessary data on operating revenues).

Answer Echoes:
- Operating revenues for 2002: $1.2 billion
- Increase in operating revenues from 2001 to 2002: $411.0 million
- Operating revenues for 2001 = Operating revenues for 2002 - Increase from 2001 to 2002
- Operating revenues for 2001 = $1.2 billion - $411.0 million
- Operating revenues for 2001 = $789.0 million
