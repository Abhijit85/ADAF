=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the percentage change in capital expenditures for property, plant, and equipment from 2008 to 2009?

**Calculation**:
1. Identify the capital expenditures for each year:
   - 2008: $926 million
   - 2009: $852 million

2. Use the formula for percentage change:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{\text{Value in 2009} - \text{Value in 2008}}{\text{Value in 2008}} \right) \times 100
   \]

3. Substitute the values into the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{852 - 926}{926} \right) \times 100
   \]

4. Calculate the difference and divide by the 2008 value:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{-74}{926} \right) \times 100
   \]

5. Complete the calculation:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Change} = -7.99\%
   \]

**Answer**: The percentage change in capital expenditures for property, plant, and equipment from 2008 to 2009 was approximately -7.99%.

**Source**: Combined analysis using text context for data extraction.

Answer Echoes:
- **Arithmetic Type**: Percentage change
- **Data Requirements**: Capital expenditures for 2008 and 2009
- **Context Needs**: Extract exact figures from the text context
- Capital expenditures for property, plant, and equipment in 2008: $926 million
- Capital expenditures for property, plant, and equipment in 2009: $852 million
