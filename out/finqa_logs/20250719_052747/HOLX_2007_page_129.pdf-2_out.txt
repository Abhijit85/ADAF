=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What portion of the total acquisition price of Suros is dedicated to goodwill?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base**: The total acquisition price of Suros is $267100.
2. **Identify Part**: The portion of the acquisition price that is goodwill is $202000.
3. **Calculate the Percentage**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of Goodwill} = \left(\frac{\text{Goodwill}}{\text{Total Acquisition Price}}\right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage of Goodwill} = \left(\frac{202000}{267100}\right) \times 100 \approx 75.63\%
   \]

**Answer**: 75.63% of the total acquisition price of Suros is dedicated to goodwill.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- From the table: Estimated Purchase Price = $267,100
