=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the percentage change of our accrued trade liabilities in 2019 compared to 2018?

**Calculation**:
To calculate the percentage change of accrued trade liabilities from 2018 to 2019, we use the formula for percentage change:

\[
\text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{\text{Value in 2019} - \text{Value in 2018}}{\text{Value in 2018}} \right) \times 100
\]

Given:
- Accrued trade liabilities as of May 26, 2019: $484 million
- Accrued trade liabilities as of May 27, 2018: $500 million

Substituting the values into the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{484 - 500}{500} \right) \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{-16}{500} \right) \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Percentage Change} = -3.2\%
\]

**Answer**: The percentage change of accrued trade liabilities in 2019 compared to 2018 was -3.2%.

**Source**: Text context (as the table did not provide the necessary data for accrued trade liabilities).

Answer Echoes:
- **Arithmetic Type**: Percentage change
- **Data Requirements**: Accrued trade liabilities for 2018 and 2019
- **Context Needs**: Extract relevant data from the provided text context
- Accrued trade liabilities as of May 26, 2019: $484 million
- Accrued trade liabilities as of May 27, 2018: $500 million
- 2019 Accrued Trade Liabilities: $484 million
- 2018 Accrued Trade Liabilities: $500 million
- Percentage Change = \(\left( \frac{484 - 500}{500} \right) \times 100 = -3.2\%\)
