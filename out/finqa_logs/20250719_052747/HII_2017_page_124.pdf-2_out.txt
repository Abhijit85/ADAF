=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What portion of the equity compensation plan approved by security holders remains available for future issuance?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base**: Total number of securities approved by security holders for issuance.
   - Total approved = Number of securities to be issued + Number of securities remaining available for future issuance.
   - Total approved = 448859 (issued) + 4087587 (remaining) = 4536446.

2. **Identify Part**: Number of securities remaining available for future issuance.
   - This is given as 4087587.

3. **Calculate Percentage**: (Part / Base) × 100
   - Percentage remaining = (4087587 / 4536446) × 100

4. **Perform Calculation**:
   - Percentage remaining = (4087587 / 4536446) × 100 ≈ 90.10%

**Answer**: 90.10% of the equity compensation plan approved by security holders remains available for future issuance.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- This is the sum of securities already issued and those remaining available for future issuance.
- Total approved = Number of securities to be issued + Number of securities remaining available for future issuance.
- Total approved = 448,859 (issued) + 4,087,587 (remaining) = 4,536,446.
- This is given as 4,087,587.
- Percentage remaining = (4,087,587 / 4,536,446) × 100
- Percentage remaining = (4,087,587 / 4,536,446) × 100 ≈ 90.10%
- Total approved = Number of securities to be issued + Number of securities remaining available for future issuance.
- Total approved = 448,859 (issued) + 4,087,587 (remaining) = 4,536,446.
- This is given as 4,087,587.
- Percentage remaining = (4,087,587 / 4,536,446) × 100
- Percentage remaining = (4,087,587 / 4,536,446) × 100 ≈ 90.10%
