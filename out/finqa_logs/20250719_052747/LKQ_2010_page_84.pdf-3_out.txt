=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In 2010, what was the sum of the future minimum lease commitments due in 2014?

**Calculation**: 
1. **Identify the Relevant Data**:
   - From the table, the future minimum lease payment due in 2014 is $37660 (in thousands).

2. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - Since there is only one value provided for the year 2014, the sum of the future minimum lease commitments for that year is simply the value itself.

3. **Result**:
   - The sum of the future minimum lease commitments due in 2014 is $37660 (in thousands).

**Answer**: $37660000

**Source**: Table data (as the value is directly extracted from the table and no additional context from the text impacts the numerical value).

Answer Echoes:
- From the table, the future minimum lease payment due in 2014 is $37,660.
- Since the question asks for the sum of the future minimum lease commitments due in 2014, and there is only one value provided for 2014, the sum is simply the value itself.
- The sum of the future minimum lease commitments due in 2014 is $37,660.
- The future minimum lease payment due in 2014 is explicitly stated as $37,660 (in thousands).
- The text provides additional context about the nature of lease agreements and commitments but does not directly impact the specific numerical value for 2014.
- The table provides a single value for the future minimum lease commitments due in 2014, which is $37,660 (in thousands).
- Since there is only one value provided for the year 2014, the sum of the future minimum lease commitments for that year is simply the value itself.
- The sum of the future minimum lease commitments due in 2014 is $37,660 (in thousands).
