=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What are the pre-tax gains recognized in other comprehensive income in 2016?

**Calculation**:
To determine the pre-tax gains recognized in other comprehensive income in 2016, we calculate the difference between the Fair Value and the Carrying Value for each note. This difference represents the unrealized gain that would be recognized in other comprehensive income.

1. **6.25% Notes due 2017**:
   - Fair Value: $724 million
   - Carrying Value: $700 million
   - Gain: $724 million - $700 million = $24 million

2. **5.00% Notes due 2019**:
   - Fair Value: $1086 million
   - Carrying Value: $997 million
   - Gain: $1086 million - $997 million = $89 million

3. **4.25% Notes due 2021**:
   - Fair Value: $808 million
   - Carrying Value: $746 million
   - Gain: $808 million - $746 million = $62 million

4. **3.375% Notes due 2022**:
   - Fair Value: $775 million
   - Carrying Value: $746 million
   - Gain: $775 million - $746 million = $29 million

5. **3.50% Notes due 2024**:
   - Fair Value: $1030 million
   - Carrying Value: $994 million
   - Gain: $1030 million - $994 million = $36 million

6. **1.25% Notes due 2025**:
   - Fair Value: $742 million
   - Carrying Value: $732 million
   - Gain: $742 million - $732 million = $10 million

Now, sum up all the gains to find the total pre-tax gains recognized in other comprehensive income for 2016:

- **Total Gain** = $24 million + $89 million + $62 million + $29 million + $36 million + $10 million = $250 million

**Answer**: The pre-tax gains recognized in other comprehensive income in 2016 are $250 million.

Answer Echoes:
- Fair Value: $724 million
- Carrying Value: $700 million
- Gain: $724 - $700 = $24 million
- Fair Value: $1,086 million
- Carrying Value: $997 million
- Gain: $1,086 - $997 = $89 million
- Fair Value: $808 million
- Carrying Value: $746 million
- Gain: $808 - $746 = $62 million
- Fair Value: $775 million
- Carrying Value: $746 million
- Gain: $775 - $746 = $29 million
- Fair Value: $1,030 million
- Carrying Value: $994 million
- Gain: $1,030 - $994 = $36 million
- Fair Value: $742 million
- Carrying Value: $732 million
- Gain: $742 - $732 = $10 million
- Total Gain = $24 million + $89 million + $62 million + $29 million + $36 million + $10 million = $250 million
- Gain for each note = Fair Value - Carrying Value
- Total Gain = Sum of all individual gains
- Fair Value: $724 million
- Carrying Value: $700 million
- Fair Value: $1,086 million
- Carrying Value: $997 million
- Fair Value: $808 million
- Carrying Value: $746 million
- Fair Value: $775 million
- Carrying Value: $746 million
- Fair Value: $1,030 million
- Carrying Value: $994 million
- Fair Value: $742 million
- Carrying Value: $732 million
- **Gain for each note** = Fair Value - Carrying Value
- Gain = $724 million - $700 million = $24 million
- Gain = $1,086 million - $997 million = $89 million
- Gain = $808 million - $746 million = $62 million
- Gain = $775 million - $746 million = $29 million
- Gain = $1,030 million - $994 million = $36 million
- Gain = $742 million - $732 million = $10 million
- **Total Gain** = $24 million + $89 million + $62 million + $29 million + $36 million + $10 million = $250 million
