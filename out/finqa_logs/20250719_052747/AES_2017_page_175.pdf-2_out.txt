=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: For 2017, what was the net interest expense with related parties, in millions?

**Calculation**:
1. Identify Interest Income and Interest Expense for 2017:
   - Interest Income = $8 million
   - Interest Expense = $36 million

2. Calculate Net Interest Expense:
   - Net Interest Expense = Interest Expense - Interest Income
   - Net Interest Expense = $36 million - $8 million

3. Perform the Calculation:
   - Net Interest Expense = $28 million

**Answer**: The net interest expense with related parties for 2017 is $28 million.

**Source**: Table data was used to extract the interest income and expense figures, which are the most reliable for exact numbers. The text context was reviewed but did not provide additional information impacting the calculation.

Answer Echoes:
- Interest income for 2017: $8 million
- Interest expense for 2017: $36 million
- Net interest expense is calculated as the interest expense minus the interest income.
- Net Interest Expense = Interest Expense - Interest Income
- Net Interest Expense = $36 million - $8 million
- Net Interest Expense = $28 million
- **Arithmetic Type**: Difference
- **Data Requirements**: Interest income and interest expense for 2017
- **Context Needs**: Understanding of what constitutes related parties
- **Calculation Steps**: Subtract interest income from interest expense
- **Interest Income for 2017**: $8 million
- **Interest Expense for 2017**: $36 million
- The text provides context about the financial situation of AES Puerto Rico and its dealings but does not directly impact the calculation of net interest expense with related parties.
- Interest Income = $8 million
- Interest Expense = $36 million
- Net Interest Expense = Interest Expense - Interest Income
- Net Interest Expense = $36 million - $8 million
- Net Interest Expense = $28 million
