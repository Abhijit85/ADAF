=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Based on the information provided, what is the ratio of the postretirement benefit obligation to the service and interest one-point percentage increase?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Required Data**:
   - Effect on other postretirement benefit obligation (One-Percentage-Point Increase): $72238
   - Effect on total of service and interest cost components (One-Percentage-Point Increase): $7367

2. **Perform Ratio Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Effect on other postretirement benefit obligation}}{\text{Effect on total of service and interest cost components}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Ratio} = \frac{72238}{7367} \approx 9.81
   \]

**Answer**: 9.81

**Source**: Table data

This ratio indicates that the effect on the postretirement benefit obligation is approximately 9.81 times greater than the effect on the total of service and interest cost components for a one-percentage-point increase.

Answer Echoes:
- We need to find the ratio of the "postretirement benefit obligation" to the "service and interest one-point percentage increase."
- From the table:
- Effect on other postretirement benefit obligation (One-Percentage-Point Increase): $72,238
- Effect on total of service and interest cost components (One-Percentage-Point Increase): $7,367
- Ratio = Effect on other postretirement benefit obligation / Effect on total of service and interest cost components
- Ratio = $72,238 / $7,367
- Ratio = 72,238 / 7,367 ≈ 9.81
- **Effect on other postretirement benefit obligation (One-Percentage-Point Increase)**: $72,238
- **Effect on total of service and interest cost components (One-Percentage-Point Increase)**: $7,367
