=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: If the company were to purchase the remaining shares at the price on December 31, 2015, how much would the company have to pay for the remaining shares?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Number of Remaining Shares**:
   - The number of securities remaining available for future issuance is 4446967.

2. **Identify the Price per Share**:
   - The weighted-average exercise price of outstanding options, warrants, and rights is $86.98.

3. **Calculate the Total Cost**:
   - Multiply the number of remaining shares by the price per share to find the total cost.
   - Calculation: \( 4446967 \text{ shares} \times \$86.98 \text{ per share} = 386688471.66 \)

**Answer**: The company would have to pay approximately $386688471.66 for the remaining shares.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- From the table, the number of securities remaining available for future issuance is given as 4,446,967.
- The weighted-average exercise price of outstanding options, warrants, and rights is given as $86.98.
- Multiply the number of remaining shares by the price per share to find the total cost.
- Calculation: \( 4,446,967 \text{ shares} \times \$86.98 \text{ per share} \)
- \( 4,446,967 \times 86.98 = 386,688,471.66 \)
- **Number of Remaining Shares**: 4,446,967 (from the table under "number of securities remaining available for future issuance under equity compensation plans")
- **Weighted-Average Exercise Price per Share**: $86.98 (from the table under "weighted-average exercise price of outstanding options, warrants, and rights")
- The number of securities remaining available for future issuance is 4,446,967.
- The weighted-average exercise price of outstanding options, warrants, and rights is $86.98.
- Multiply the number of remaining shares by the price per share to find the total cost.
- Calculation: \( 4,446,967 \text{ shares} \times \$86.98 \text{ per share} \)
- \( 4,446,967 \times 86.98 = 386,688,471.66 \)
