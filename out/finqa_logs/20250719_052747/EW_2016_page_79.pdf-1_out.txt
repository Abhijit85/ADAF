=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What percentage of the total cash purchase price net of cash acquired was represented by goodwill?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base**: The base is the "Total cash purchase price, net of cash acquired," which is $320.1 million.
2. **Identify Part**: The part we are interested in is the "Goodwill," which is $258.9 million.
3. **Calculate Percentage**: Use the formula for percentage calculation:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Base}}\right) \times 100
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{258.9}{320.1}\right) \times 100
   \]
4. **Perform Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{258.9}{320.1}\right) \times 100 \approx 80.87\%
   \]

**Answer**: 80.87%
