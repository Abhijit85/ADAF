=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: How much did the lease obligations drop from 2004 to 2011?

**Calculation**:
1. **Initial Lease Obligations (2004)**: $2328 million
2. **Lease Obligations by 2011**: 
   - Total Lease Obligations from 2007 to 2011: $351 (2007) + $281 (2008) + $209 (2009) + $178 (2010) + $158 (2011) = $1177 million
3. **Calculate the Drop in Lease Obligations**:
   - Lease Obligations Drop = Initial Lease Obligations - Lease Obligations by 2011
   - Lease Obligations Drop = $2328 million - $1177 million = $1151 million

**Answer**: The lease obligations dropped by $1151 million from 2004 to 2011.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Lease Obligations in 2011: $158 million
- Lease Obligations Thereafter: $1,151 million
- Total Lease Obligations from 2007 to 2011: $351 (2007) + $281 (2008) + $209 (2009) + $178 (2010) + $158 (2011) = $1,177 million
- Total Lease Obligations: $2,328 million
- Lease Obligations Drop = Initial Lease Obligations - Lease Obligations by 2011
- Lease Obligations Drop = $2,328 million - $1,177 million = $1,151 million
- Lease Obligations Drop = Initial Lease Obligations - Lease Obligations by 2011
- Lease Obligations Drop = $2,328 million - $1,177 million = $1,151 million
