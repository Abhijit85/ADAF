=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the percentage change in R&D and E spendings from 2013 to 2014?

**Calculation**: 
To calculate the percentage change, we need the R&D and E spendings for both 2013 and 2014. The text provides the R&D and E spendings for 2013 as $1.3 billion. However, the spending for 2014 is not provided in the text or the table. Without the 2014 data, we cannot perform the calculation.

**Answer**: Unable to calculate the percentage change due to missing data for 2014 R&D and E spendings.

**Source**: Text (2013 data), Missing (2014 data)

Answer Echoes:
- **Arithmetic Type**: Percentage change
- **Data Requirements**: R&D and E spendings for 2013 and 2014
- **Context Needs**: Information on R&D and E spendings from the text
- The text provides the R&D and E spendings for 2013: $1.3 billion.
- The text does not provide the R&D and E spendings for 2014, which is necessary to calculate the percentage change.
- **Formula for Percentage Change**: \((\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}) / \text{Old Value} \times 100\%\)
- **2013 R&D and E Spending**: $1.3 billion (from text)
- **2014 R&D and E Spending**: Not provided in the text or table
- The R&D and E spending for 2014 is missing. Without this information, the percentage change cannot be calculated.
