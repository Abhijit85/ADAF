=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: As of December 31, 2016, what percentage of manufacturing and processing facilities are leased?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base and Part**:
   - **Base**: Total number of facilities = 87 (sum of owned and leased)
   - **Part**: Number of leased facilities = 4

2. **Calculate Percentage of Leased Facilities**:
   - **Formula**: (Part / Base) × 100
   - **Calculation**: (4 / 87) × 100

3. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - (4 / 87) × 100 ≈ 4.60%

**Answer**: Approximately 4.60% of the manufacturing and processing facilities are leased as of December 31, 2016.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- **Base**: Total number of facilities (both owned and leased).
- **Part**: Number of leased facilities.
- **Owned Facilities**:
- United States: 43
- Canada: 3
- Europe: 11
- Rest of World: 26
- **Total Owned** = 43 + 3 + 11 + 26 = 83
- **Leased Facilities**:
- United States: 2
- Canada: —
- Europe: —
- Rest of World: 2
- **Total Leased** = 2 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 4
- **Total Facilities** = Total Owned + Total Leased = 83 + 4 = 87
- **Calculation**: (Part / Base) × 100 = (4 / 87) × 100
- **Calculation**: (4 / 87) × 100 ≈ 4.60%
- **Owned Facilities:**
- United States: 43
- Canada: 3
- Europe: 11
- Rest of World: 26
- **Total Owned** = 43 + 3 + 11 + 26 = 83
- **Leased Facilities:**
- United States: 2
- Canada: —
- Europe: —
- Rest of World: 2
- **Total Leased** = 2 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 4
- **Total Facilities** = Total Owned + Total Leased = 83 + 4 = 87
- The text confirms the numbers provided in the table and states that the company owns 83 facilities and leases 4, totaling 87 facilities.
- **Base**: Total number of facilities = 87
- **Part**: Number of leased facilities = 4
- **Formula**: (Part / Base) × 100
- **Calculation**: (4 / 87) × 100
- (4 / 87) × 100 ≈ 4.60%
- Total facilities = 87 (83 owned, 4 leased)
- Percentage of leased facilities = (4 / 87) × 100 ≈ 4.60%
