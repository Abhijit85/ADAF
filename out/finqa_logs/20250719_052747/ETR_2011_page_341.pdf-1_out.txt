=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the average price of the increased electricity usage per GWh?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Increase in Revenue Due to Increased Usage**:
   - Increase in net revenue attributed to volume/weather: $18.9 million.

2. **Identify the Increase in Electricity Usage**:
   - Increase in billed electricity usage: 1046 GWh.

3. **Calculate the Average Price per GWh**:
   - Average Price per GWh = Increase in Revenue / Increase in Usage
   - Average Price per GWh = $18900000 / 1046 GWh

4. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - Average Price per GWh = $18900000 / 1046 GWh ≈ $18067.30 per GWh

**Answer**: The average price of the increased electricity usage per GWh is approximately $18067.30.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- 2009 net revenue: $536.7 million
- 2010 net revenue: $555.3 million
- Increase due to volume/weather: $18.9 million
- 2009 net revenue: $536.7 million
- 2010 net revenue: $555.3 million
- Increase in net revenue due to volume/weather: $18.9 million
- Increase in billed electricity usage: 1046 GWh
- The increase in net revenue attributed to volume/weather is $18.9 million.
- The increase in billed electricity usage is 1046 GWh.
- To find the average price per GWh, divide the increase in revenue by the increase in electricity usage.
- Average Price per GWh = Increase in Revenue / Increase in Usage
- Average Price per GWh = $18.9 million / 1046 GWh
- Average Price per GWh = $18,900,000 / 1046 GWh ≈ $18,067.30 per GWh
- Increase in revenue due to volume/weather: $18.9 million
- Increase in electricity usage: 1046 GWh
- Average Price per GWh = $18,900,000 / 1046 GWh ≈ $18,067.30 per GWh
