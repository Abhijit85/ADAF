=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Considering the year 2016, what was the percentual increase in the high sale price observed during the first and second quarters?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base and Part**:
   - **Base**: The high sale price in the first quarter of 2016, which is $30.66.
   - **Part**: The high sale price in the second quarter of 2016, which is $34.50.

2. **Calculate the Increase**:
   - Increase = Second Quarter High - First Quarter High
   - Increase = $34.50 - $30.66 = $3.84

3. **Calculate the Percentage Increase**:
   - Percentage Increase = (Increase / First Quarter High) × 100
   - Percentage Increase = ($3.84 / $30.66) × 100

4. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - Percentage Increase = 0.1253 × 100 = 12.53%

**Answer**: 12.53%

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- **Base**: The high sale price in the first quarter of 2016, which is $30.66.
- **Part**: The high sale price in the second quarter of 2016, which is $34.50.
- Increase = Second Quarter High - First Quarter High
- Increase = $34.50 - $30.66 = $3.84
- Percentage Increase = (Increase / First Quarter High) × 100
- Percentage Increase = ($3.84 / $30.66) × 100
- Percentage Increase = 0.1253 × 100 = 12.53%
- **First Quarter High Sale Price (2016)**: $30.66
- **Second Quarter High Sale Price (2016)**: $34.50
- **Base**: The high sale price in the first quarter of 2016, which is $30.66.
- **Part**: The high sale price in the second quarter of 2016, which is $34.50.
- Increase = Second Quarter High - First Quarter High
- Increase = $34.50 - $30.66 = $3.84
- Percentage Increase = (Increase / First Quarter High) × 100
- Percentage Increase = ($3.84 / $30.66) × 100
- Percentage Increase = 0.1253 × 100 = 12.53%
