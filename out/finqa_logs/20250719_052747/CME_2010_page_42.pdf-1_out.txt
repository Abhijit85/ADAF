=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: For the Chicago headquarters lease, assuming the two options to extend the term are exercised, what is the last year the space can be leased?

**Calculation**:
1. **Initial Lease Expiration**: 2022
2. **First Extension Option**: 7 years
   - Calculation: 2022 + 7 = 2029
3. **Second Extension Option**: 10 years
   - Calculation: 2029 + 10 = 2039

**Answer**: 2039

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context, which provided the specific durations of the lease extensions (7 years and 10 years).

Answer Echoes:
- The lease for the Chicago headquarters at 20 South Wacker Drive expires in 2022.
- The problem states there are two options to extend the lease. However, the duration of each extension option is not provided in the table.
- Since the table does not specify the duration of each extension option, we must make a reasonable assumption. Typically, lease extension options are for 5 years each, but this can vary.
- Assuming each extension option is for 5 years:
- First extension: 2022 + 5 = 2027
- Second extension: 2027 + 5 = 2032
- The lease for the Chicago headquarters at 20 South Wacker Drive expires in 2022.
- There are two consecutive options to extend the term for seven and ten years, respectively.
- Initial lease expiration: 2022
- First extension option: 7 years
- Second extension option: 10 years
- First extension: 2022 + 7 = 2029
- Second extension: 2029 + 10 = 2039
- Lease expiration: 2022
- First extension: 7 years
- Second extension: 10 years
- 2022 + 7 (first extension) = 2029
- 2029 + 10 (second extension) = 2039
