=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the percentage of the common stock repurchase among the total program of repurchases?

**Calculation**:
1. **Total Authorization for Repurchases**: $2.25 billion
2. **Actual Repurchases Executed**:
   - Accelerated Share Repurchase (ASR) with Goldman Sachs: $1.5 billion
   - Open Market Repurchases: $750 million
   - Total Repurchases Executed = $1.5 billion + $0.75 billion = $2.25 billion
3. **Common Stock Repurchase**: The entire $2.25 billion was used for common stock repurchases.

4. **Percentage Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of Common Stock Repurchase} = \left( \frac{\text{Total Common Stock Repurchase}}{\text{Total Authorization}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage of Common Stock Repurchase} = \left( \frac{2.25 \text{ billion}}{2.25 \text{ billion}} \right) \times 100 = 100\%
   \]

**Answer**: The percentage of the common stock repurchase among the total program of repurchases is 100%.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context.

Answer Echoes:
- The text states that there was an authorization for share repurchases of up to $2.25 billion of common stock, exclusive of shares repurchased in connection with employee stock plans.
- An accelerated share repurchase agreement (ASR) was executed with Goldman Sachs for $1.5 billion.
- An additional $750 million was used to repurchase shares in the open market.
- Total repurchases executed = $1.5 billion (ASR) + $0.75 billion (open market) = $2.25 billion.
- The entire $2.25 billion was used for common stock repurchases, as specified in the text.
- Since the entire authorized amount of $2.25 billion was used for common stock repurchases, the percentage of common stock repurchase among the total program of repurchases is calculated as follows:
- Total authorization for repurchases: $2.25 billion
- Total common stock repurchase: $2.25 billion
- Percentage of common stock repurchase = \((2.25 \text{ billion} / 2.25 \text{ billion}) \times 100 = 100\%\)
