=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Operating expenses were what multiple of pre-tax earnings in 2015?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Components**:
   - Operating Expenses in 2015: $13.94 billion
   - Pre-tax Earnings in 2015: $1.21 billion

2. **Calculate the Ratio**:
   - Ratio = Operating Expenses / Pre-tax Earnings
   - Ratio = $13.94 billion / $1.21 billion

3. **Perform the Division**:
   - Ratio = 13.94 / 1.21 ≈ 11.5289

**Answer**: Operating expenses were approximately 11.53 times the pre-tax earnings in 2015.

**Source**: Combined analysis using text context for financial data.

Answer Echoes:
- Operating Expenses in 2015: $2,402 million
- Pre-tax Earnings in 2015: $3,034 million
- Ratio = Operating Expenses / Pre-tax Earnings
- Ratio = $2,402 million / $3,034 million
- Ratio = 2,402 / 3,034 ≈ 0.7917
- **Operating Expenses in 2015**: $13.94 billion
- **Pre-tax Earnings in 2015**: $1.21 billion
- Operating Expenses = $13.94 billion
- Pre-tax Earnings = $1.21 billion
- Ratio = Operating Expenses / Pre-tax Earnings
- Ratio = $13.94 billion / $1.21 billion
- Ratio = 13.94 / 1.21 ≈ 11.5289
