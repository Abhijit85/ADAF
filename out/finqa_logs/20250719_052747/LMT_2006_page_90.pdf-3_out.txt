=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: At December 31, 2006, what was the ratio of the expected future pension benefits after 2012 compared to 2008?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Components**:
   - Expected future pension benefits after 2012: This is given as the sum for the years 2012-2016.
   - Pension benefits for the year 2008.

2. **Extract Numbers**:
   - Pension benefits for years 2012-2016: $9530 million
   - Pension benefits for the year 2008: $1490 million

3. **Calculate Ratio**:
   - Ratio = Pension benefits after 2012 / Pension benefits for 2008
   - Ratio = $9530 million / $1490 million

4. **Perform Division**:
   - Ratio = 9530 / 1490 ≈ 6.40

**Answer**: The ratio of the expected future pension benefits after 2012 compared to 2008 is approximately 6.40.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Expected future pension benefits after 2012: This is given as the sum for the years 2012-2016.
- Pension benefits for the year 2008.
- Pension benefits for years 2012-2016: $9,530 million
- Pension benefits for the year 2008: $1,490 million
- Ratio = Pension benefits after 2012 / Pension benefits for 2008
- Ratio = $9,530 million / $1,490 million
- Ratio = 9,530 / 1,490 ≈ 6.40
- The ratio of the expected future pension benefits after 2012 compared to 2008 is approximately 6.40.
- **Pension benefits for years 2012-2016**: $9,530 million
- **Pension benefits for the year 2008**: $1,490 million
- We need the pension benefits for the years after 2012 and compare them to the benefits for the year 2008.
- Pension benefits for years 2012-2016: $9,530 million
- Pension benefits for the year 2008: $1,490 million
- Ratio = Pension benefits after 2012 / Pension benefits for 2008
- Ratio = $9,530 million / $1,490 million
- Ratio = 9,530 / 1,490 ≈ 6.40
- The ratio of the expected future pension benefits after 2012 compared to 2008 is approximately 6.40.
- Pension benefits for 2012-2016: $9,530 million
- Pension benefits for 2008: $1,490 million
- Ratio = 9,530 / 1,490 = 6.40
