=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the anticipated percentage increase in the capital investment in 2007 from 2006?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base (2006 Capital Investment)**:
   - 2006 Capital Investment = $2242 million

2. **Identify Part (2007 Capital Investment)**:
   - 2007 Capital Investment = $3200 million (as $3.2 billion is equivalent to $3200 million)

3. **Calculate Percentage Increase**:
   - Use the formula for percentage increase:
     \[
     \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}}{\text{Old Value}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Substitute the values:
     \[
     \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{3200 - 2242}{2242} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Calculate the difference:
     \[
     3200 - 2242 = 958
     \]
   - Calculate the percentage increase:
     \[
     \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{958}{2242} \right) \times 100 \approx 42.74\%
     \]

**Answer**: The anticipated percentage increase in capital investment in 2007 from 2006 is approximately 42.74%.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data (2006 Capital Investment) and text context (2007 Capital Investment).

Answer Echoes:
- From the table, the total capital investment in 2006 is $2,242 million.
- The question asks for the anticipated increase, but the 2007 investment amount is not provided in the table. Therefore, we cannot directly calculate the percentage increase without this information.
- Normally, the formula for percentage increase is:
- However, since the "New Value" (2007 capital investment) is not given, we cannot proceed with the calculation.
- **2006 Capital Investment**: $2,242 million
- **2007 Capital Investment**: The text states that the anticipated total capital investment for 2007 is approximately $3.2 billion.
- 2006 Capital Investment = $2,242 million
- 2007 Capital Investment = $3,200 million (since $3.2 billion is equivalent to $3,200 million)
- Use the formula for percentage increase:
- Substitute the values:
- Calculate the difference:
- Calculate the percentage increase:
- 2006 Capital Investment = $2,242 million (from table)
- 2007 Capital Investment = $3,200 million (from text context)
- Difference = $958 million
- Percentage Increase = \(\approx 42.74\%\)
