=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In 2005, what was the ratio of the breast implant receivables to the breast implant liabilities?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Components**:
   - Breast implant receivables in 2005: $130 million
   - Breast implant liabilities in 2005: $7 million

2. **Calculate Ratio**:
   - Ratio = Breast implant receivables / Breast implant liabilities
   - Ratio = $130 million / $7 million

3. **Perform Division**:
   - Ratio = 130 / 7 ≈ 18.57

**Answer**: The ratio of breast implant receivables to breast implant liabilities in 2005 is approximately 18.57.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Breast implant receivables in 2005: $130 million
- Breast implant liabilities in 2005: $7 million
- Ratio = Breast implant receivables / Breast implant liabilities
- Ratio = $130 million / $7 million
- Ratio = 130 / 7 ≈ 18.57
- **Arithmetic Type**: Ratio
- **Data Requirements**: Values for breast implant receivables and liabilities for 2005
- **Context Needs**: Confirmation of values from the text context
- **Breast Implant Receivables**: $130 million
- **Breast Implant Liabilities**: $7 million
- The text confirms the receivables and liabilities values for breast implants in 2005.
- **Formula**: Ratio = Breast implant receivables / Breast implant liabilities
- Breast implant receivables: $130 million
- Breast implant liabilities: $7 million
- Values confirmed as $130 million and $7 million respectively.
- Ratio = $130 million / $7 million
- Ratio = 130 / 7 ≈ 18.57
- The calculation is straightforward and consistent with the provided data.
- The ratio is expressed as a decimal to two decimal places.
