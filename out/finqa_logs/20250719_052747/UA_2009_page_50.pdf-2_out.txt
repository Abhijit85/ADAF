=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the percentage change in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts from 2008 to 2009?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Fair Values**:
   - Fair value in 2008: $1.2 million
   - Fair value in 2009: $0.3 million

2. **Calculate the Change in Fair Value**:
   - Change = Fair value in 2009 - Fair value in 2008
   - Change = $0.3 million - $1.2 million = -$0.9 million

3. **Calculate the Percentage Change**:
   - Percentage Change = (Change / Absolute value of 2008 fair value) × 100
   - Percentage Change = (-$0.9 million / $1.2 million) × 100
   - Percentage Change = (-0.75) × 100 = -75%

**Answer**: The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts decreased by 75% from 2008 to 2009.

**Source**: Combined analysis using text context for fair value data.

Answer Echoes:
- Unrealized foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) for 2008: $(5,459)
- Unrealized foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) for 2009: $5,222
- Change = 2009 value - 2008 value
- Change = $5,222 - (-$5,459) = $5,222 + $5,459 = $10,681
- Percentage Change = (Change / Absolute value of 2008 value) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($10,681 / $5,459) × 100
- Percentage Change = 1.957 × 100 = 195.7%
- Fair value of foreign currency forward contracts as of December 31, 2009: $0.3 million
- Fair value of foreign currency forward contracts as of December 31, 2008: $1.2 million
- Fair value in 2008: $1.2 million
- Fair value in 2009: $0.3 million
- Change = Fair value in 2009 - Fair value in 2008
- Change = $0.3 million - $1.2 million = -$0.9 million
- Percentage Change = (Change / Absolute value of 2008 fair value) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-$0.9 million / $1.2 million) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-0.75) × 100 = -75%
