=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Based on the given average price per share, how much money did the repurchases cost in 2007?

**Calculation**:
1. Extract data from the table:
   - Number of Shares Repurchased: 14669
   - Average Price Per Share: $43.89

2. Perform the calculation:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Shares} \times \text{Average Price Per Share}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 14669 \times 43.89
   \]

3. Calculate the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 644761.41
   \]

**Answer**: The total cost of the share repurchases in December 2007 was $644761.41.

**Source**: Table data was used for the calculation, as it provided the exact numbers needed for the arithmetic operation.

Answer Echoes:
- Number of Shares Repurchased in December: 14,669
- Average Price Per Share: $43.89
- **Number of Shares Repurchased**: 14,669
- **Average Price Per Share**: $43.89
- The context does not provide additional data for the calculation of the total cost of repurchases, but it confirms that the repurchases were made to pay taxes on the vesting of restricted stock granted to employees.
- Use the formula:
- Plug in the values:
- Calculate the total cost:
- Number of Shares Repurchased: 14,669
- Average Price Per Share: $43.89
- Total Cost = 14,669 shares × $43.89/share = $644,761.41
