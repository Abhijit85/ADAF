=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What are the total amount of net tangible assets obtained through the acquisition?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Tangible Assets**:
   - Cash: $45826
   - Other assets: $2337

2. **Identify Tangible Liabilities**:
   - Deferred income tax liabilities: $(9788)
   - Other liabilities: $(49797)

3. **Calculate Net Tangible Assets**:
   - Net Tangible Assets = (Cash + Other assets) - (Deferred income tax liabilities + Other liabilities)
   - Net Tangible Assets = ($45826 + $2337) - ($9788 + $49797)
   - Net Tangible Assets = $48163 - $59585
   - Net Tangible Assets = -$11422

**Answer**: The total amount of net tangible assets obtained through the acquisition is -$11422.

**Source**: Table data was used for the calculation, as it provided the necessary values for tangible assets and liabilities.

Answer Echoes:
- Cash: $45,826
- Other assets: $2,337
- Deferred income tax assets (liabilities): $(9,788)
- Other liabilities: $(49,797)
- Net Tangible Assets = (Cash + Other assets) - (Deferred income tax liabilities + Other liabilities)
- Net Tangible Assets = ($45,826 + $2,337) - ($9,788 + $49,797)
- Net Tangible Assets = $48,163 - $59,585
- Net Tangible Assets = -$11,422
- **Arithmetic Type**: Difference (Net tangible assets calculation)
- **Data Requirements**: Values for tangible assets and liabilities
- **Context Needs**: Understanding of what constitutes tangible assets and liabilities
- **Calculation Steps**: Identify relevant values, perform subtraction
- **Exact Numbers**:
- Tangible Assets:
- Cash: $45,826
- Other assets: $2,337
- Tangible Liabilities:
- Deferred income tax liabilities: $(9,788)
- Other liabilities: $(49,797)
- **Additional Context**: No additional context needed from the text for this calculation as the table provides all necessary values.
- Cash: $45,826
- Other assets: $2,337
- Deferred income tax liabilities: $(9,788)
- Other liabilities: $(49,797)
- Net Tangible Assets = (Cash + Other assets) - (Deferred income tax liabilities + Other liabilities)
- Net Tangible Assets = ($45,826 + $2,337) - ($9,788 + $49,797)
- Net Tangible Assets = $48,163 - $59,585
- Net Tangible Assets = -$11,422
- Tangible Assets: Cash = $45,826, Other assets = $2,337
- Tangible Liabilities: Deferred income tax liabilities = $(9,788), Other liabilities = $(49,797)
- Net Tangible Assets = ($45,826 + $2,337) - ($9,788 + $49,797) = $48,163 - $59,585 = -$11,422
