=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the combined number of equity compensation plans approved by security holders?

**Calculation**: 
- From the table, the number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants, and rights under equity compensation plans approved by security holders is 448859.
- Since the question asks for the combined number of equity compensation plans approved by security holders, and the table only provides one relevant figure for approved plans, the number is directly taken from the table without needing further addition.

**Answer**: 448859

**Source**: Table data, confirmed by text context.

- From the table, the number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants, and rights under equity compensation plans approved by security holders is **448,859**.
- Since the question asks for the combined number of equity compensation plans approved by security holders, and the table only provides one relevant figure for approved plans, the number is directly taken from the table without needing further addition.
- **Arithmetic Type**: Sum
- **Data Requirements**: Number of securities to be issued under approved equity compensation plans
- **Context Needs**: Understanding of what constitutes an approved equity compensation plan
- **Exact Numbers**: The table provides the number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants, and rights under equity compensation plans approved by security holders: **448,859**.
