=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In 2016, what was the ratio of the net income increase to the net revenues?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Required Data**:
   - Net Income Increase for 2016: $92.9 million (from text context)
   - Net Revenues for 2016: $1520.5 million (from table data)

2. **Calculate the Ratio**:
   \[
   \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Net Income Increase}}{\text{Net Revenues for 2016}} = \frac{92.9}{1520.5}
   \]

3. **Perform Calculation**:
   \[
   \frac{92.9}{1520.5} \approx 0.0611
   \]

**Answer**: The ratio of the net income increase to the net revenues for 2016 is approximately 0.0611.

**Source**: Combined analysis using both table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- **Net Income Increase**: This is not directly provided in the table. However, we can infer it from the change in net revenue from 2016 to 2017.
- **Net Revenues for 2016**: $1,520.5 million
- **2016 Net Revenue**: $1,520.5 million
- **2017 Net Revenue**: $1,522.6 million
- **Net Income Increase**: $1,522.6 million - $1,520.5 million = $2.1 million
- **Ratio of Net Income Increase to 2016 Net Revenues**: $2.1 million / $1,520.5 million
- **Calculation**: \( \frac{2.1}{1,520.5} \approx 0.00138 \)
- **Answer**: The ratio of the net income increase to the net revenues for 2016 is approximately 0.00138.
- From the financial context, we know that net income increased by $92.9 million from 2015 to 2016.
- From the table data, the net revenues for 2016 are $1,520.5 million.
- Net Income Increase for 2016: $92.9 million
- Net Revenues for 2016: $1,520.5 million
- The ratio of the net income increase to the net revenues for 2016 is calculated as follows:
- Calculate the ratio:
- Net Income Increase: $92.9 million (from financial context)
- Net Revenues for 2016: $1,520.5 million (from table data)
- Ratio Calculation: \( \frac{92.9}{1,520.5} \approx 0.0611 \)
