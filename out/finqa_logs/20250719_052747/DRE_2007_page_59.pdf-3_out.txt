=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the percent of the total purchase price for the purchase of a portfolio of five industrial buildings in Seattle, Virginia, and Houston that was allocated to in-service real estate assets?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Base and Part**:
   - **Base (Total Purchase Price)**: $89.7 million
   - **Part (In-service Real Estate Assets)**: $66.1 million

2. **Calculate the Percentage**:
   \[
   \left(\frac{\text{In-service Real Estate Assets}}{\text{Total Purchase Price}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{66.1}{89.7}\right) \times 100
   \]

3. **Perform the Calculation**:
   \[
   \left(\frac{66.1}{89.7}\right) \times 100 \approx 73.68\%
   \]

**Answer**: Approximately 73.68% of the total purchase price was allocated to in-service real estate assets.

**Source**: Combined analysis using text context for accurate financial data.

Answer Echoes:
- **Base (Total Purchase Price)**: This is the "Purchase price, net of assumed liabilities," which is $713,202.
- **Part (In-service Real Estate Assets)**: This includes "Operating rental properties" and "Land held for development," which are $602,011 and $154,300, respectively.
- **Total In-service Real Estate Assets**: $602,011 (Operating rental properties) + $154,300 (Land held for development) = $756,311
- **Percentage Calculation**: \((\text{Total In-service Real Estate Assets} / \text{Total Purchase Price}) \times 100\)
- **Base (Total Purchase Price)**: $89.7 million
- **Part (In-service Real Estate Assets)**: $66.1 million
