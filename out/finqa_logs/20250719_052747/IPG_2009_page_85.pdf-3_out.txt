**Question**: What percentage of amounts expensed in 2009 came from discretionary company contributions?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the total amount expensed for the savings plans in 2009**: $35.1 million
2. **Identify the discretionary company contributions in 2009**: $3.8 million
3. **Calculate the percentage of the total expensed amount that came from discretionary company contributions**:

   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Discretionary Contributions}}{\text{Total Expensed Amount}} \right) \times 100
   \]

   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{3.8}{35.1} \right) \times 100
   \]

   \[
   \text{Percentage} \approx 10.83\%
   \]

**Answer**: Approximately 10.83% of the amounts expensed in 2009 came from discretionary company contributions.
