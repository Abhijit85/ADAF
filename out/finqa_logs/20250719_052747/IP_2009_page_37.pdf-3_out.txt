=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Considering the years 2008 and 2009, what is the variation observed in the operating profit, in millions?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Values**:
   - Operating Profit in 2009: $433 million
   - Operating Profit in 2008: $17 million

2. **Calculate the Difference**:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Operating Profit in 2009} - \text{Operating Profit in 2008}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 433 - 17 = 416
   \]

3. **Check Sign**: The result is positive, indicating an increase.

4. **Format**: The difference is expressed in millions.

**Answer**: The variation observed in the operating profit between 2008 and 2009 is an increase of $416 million.

**Source**: Table data (Operating Profit values for 2008 and 2009).

Answer Echoes:
- Operating Profit in 2009: $433 million
- Operating Profit in 2008: $17 million
- Operating Profit in 2009: $433 million
- Operating Profit in 2008: $17 million
- The text context provides additional details about the factors influencing operating profits, such as alternative fuel mixture credits and facility closure costs. However, these details do not alter the basic arithmetic calculation of the difference in operating profits between the two years.
- Operating Profit in 2009: $433 million
- Operating Profit in 2008: $17 million
- Operating Profit in 2009: $433 million (from table)
- Operating Profit in 2008: $17 million (from table)
- Difference = $433 million - $17 million = $416 million
