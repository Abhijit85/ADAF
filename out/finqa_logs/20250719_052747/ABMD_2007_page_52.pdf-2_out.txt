=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: How much of the total contractual commitments are current?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Current Obligations**:
   - Operating Lease Obligations due in less than 1 year: $1960
   - Purchase Obligations due in less than 1 year: $6421

2. **Sum Current Obligations**:
   - Total current obligations = Operating Lease Obligations (less than 1 year) + Purchase Obligations (less than 1 year)
   - Total current obligations = $1960 + $6421

3. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - Total current obligations = $8381

**Answer**: $8381

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Operating Lease Obligations due in less than 1 year: $1,960
- Purchase Obligations due in less than 1 year: $6,421
- Total current obligations = Operating Lease Obligations (less than 1 year) + Purchase Obligations (less than 1 year)
- Total current obligations = $1,960 + $6,421
- Total current obligations = $8,381
- From the table data provided:
- **Operating Lease Obligations due in less than 1 year**: $1,960
- **Purchase Obligations due in less than 1 year**: $6,421
- Operating Lease Obligations due in less than 1 year: $1,960
- Purchase Obligations due in less than 1 year: $6,421
- Total current obligations = Operating Lease Obligations (less than 1 year) + Purchase Obligations (less than 1 year)
- Total current obligations = $1,960 + $6,421
- Total current obligations = $8,381
