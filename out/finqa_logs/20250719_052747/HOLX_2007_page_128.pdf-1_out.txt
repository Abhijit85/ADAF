=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the fair value of Hologic common stock used for acquiring R2?

**Calculation**: 
- From the text context, the acquisition of R2 involved several components contributing to the total purchase price of $220600. The breakdown is as follows:
  - Hologic common stock: $205500
  - Cash paid: $6900
  - Debt assumed: $5700
  - Acquisition-related fees and expenses: $2500

- The value of the Hologic common stock used in the acquisition is explicitly stated as $205500.

- Verification of the total purchase price:
  - Total = $205500 (stock) + $6900 (cash) + $5700 (debt) + $2500 (fees) = $220600
  - This confirms the breakdown is accurate and matches the aggregate purchase price.

**Answer**: The fair value of Hologic common stock used for acquiring R2 is $205500.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context and verification with table data.

Answer Echoes:
- The aggregate purchase price for R2 was approximately $220,600.
- This purchase price consisted of:
- Approximately 4,400 shares of Hologic common stock valued at $205,500.
- Cash paid of $6,900.
- Debt assumed of $5,700.
- Approximately $2,500 for acquisition-related fees and expenses.
- The table does not provide specific data on the stock component, but the text context gives us the necessary breakdown.
- From the text, the value of the Hologic common stock used in the acquisition is explicitly stated as $205,500.
- Sum of components:
- Stock: $205,500
- Cash: $6,900
- Debt: $5,700
- Fees: $2,500
- Total = $205,500 + $6,900 + $5,700 + $2,500 = $220,600
- This matches the aggregate purchase price, confirming the breakdown is accurate.
- Stock component value: $205,500 (from text context)
- Direct extraction from text context, no further arithmetic needed.
