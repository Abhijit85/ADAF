=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What were the average operating profits for aeronautics in millions between 2014 and 2016?

**Calculation**:
1. Extract the operating profits for each year from the table:
   - 2014: $1649 million
   - 2015: $1681 million
   - 2016: $1887 million

2. Calculate the total operating profit over the three years:
   \[
   1649 + 1681 + 1887 = 5217 \text{ million}
   \]

3. Calculate the average operating profit by dividing the total by the number of years (3):
   \[
   \frac{5217}{3} = 1739 \text{ million}
   \]

**Answer**: The average operating profit for aeronautics between 2014 and 2016 was $1739 million.

**Source**: Table data analysis.
