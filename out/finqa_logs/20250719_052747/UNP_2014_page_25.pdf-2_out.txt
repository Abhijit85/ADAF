=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: If overall freight revenues in 2014 grow at the same rate as agricultural arc growth, what would projected 2015 revenues be in millions?

**Calculation**:
1. **2014 Freight Revenues**: $22560 million
2. **Assumed Growth Rate**: 9% (based on overall freight revenue growth from 2013 to 2014, as no specific rate for agricultural arc was provided)

To calculate the projected 2015 freight revenues, use the formula:
\[ \text{Projected 2015 Revenue} = \text{2014 Revenue} \times (1 + \text{Growth Rate}) \]

Substitute the values:
\[ \text{Projected 2015 Revenue} = 22560 \times (1 + 0.09) \]
\[ \text{Projected 2015 Revenue} = 22560 \times 1.09 \]
\[ \text{Projected 2015 Revenue} = 24590.4 \]

**Answer**: $24590.4 million

**Source**: Combined analysis using table data for 2014 freight revenues and assumed growth rate based on text context.

Answer Echoes:
- **2014 Freight Revenues**: $22,560 million
- **Growth Rate**: 9% (assumed based on overall freight revenue growth from 2013 to 2014)
- The text confirms that freight revenues in 2014 grew due to a combination of volume growth and core pricing gains, but it does not specify a separate growth rate for agricultural arc. Therefore, we use the overall growth rate for freight revenues as a proxy.
- Use the overall freight revenue growth rate from 2013 to 2014, which is 9%.
- Use the formula for projected revenue:
- Substitute the values:
- Perform the calculation:
