=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the change in industry segment operating profits between 2004 and 2005?

**Calculation**:
1. Identify the industry segment operating profits for each year:
   - 2005 profits: $1923 million
   - 2004 profits: $2040 million

2. Calculate the difference between the two years:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{2005 profits} - \text{2004 profits} = \$1923 \text{ million} - \$2040 \text{ million} = -\$117 \text{ million}
   \]

**Answer**: The change in industry segment operating profits between 2004 and 2005 is a decrease of $117 million.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Industry segment operating profits in 2005: $1,923 million
- Industry segment operating profits in 2004: $2,040 million
- Difference = 2005 profits - 2004 profits
- Difference = $1,923 million - $2,040 million
- Difference = -$117 million
- The change in industry segment operating profits between 2004 and 2005 is a decrease of $117 million.
- Industry segment operating profits in 2005: $1,923 million
- Industry segment operating profits in 2004: $2,040 million
- The text provides additional context about the factors affecting the operating profits, such as higher costs for energy, wood, caustic soda, and other raw materials, which reduced operating profits by $586 million compared to 2004. It also mentions lower sales volumes and other factors that contributed to the decrease in profits.
- We need the industry segment operating profits for both 2004 and 2005 to calculate the change.
- 2005 profits = $1,923 million
- 2004 profits = $2,040 million
- Calculate the difference between the two years:
- The calculation aligns with the information provided in the text, confirming a decrease in operating profits by $117 million due to various factors.
- The change in industry segment operating profits between 2004 and 2005 is a decrease of $117 million.
- Difference = $1,923 million - $2,040 million = -$117 million
