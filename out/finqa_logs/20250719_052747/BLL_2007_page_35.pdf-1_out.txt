Answer Echoes:
- Total Number of Shares Purchased in October 2007: 705,292
- Average Price Paid per Share in October 2007: $53.53
- Total Cash Outflow = Total Number of Shares Purchased × Average Price Paid per Share
- Total Cash Outflow = 705,292 shares × $53.53/share
- Total Cash Outflow = 705,292 × 53.53 = 37,754,960.76
- Total Cash Outflow in Millions = 37,754,960.76 / 1,000,000 = 37.75 million
- Total Number of Shares Purchased in October 2007: 705,292
- Average Price Paid per Share in October 2007: $53.53
- Formula: Total Cash Outflow = Total Number of Shares Purchased × Average Price Paid per Share
- Total Cash Outflow = 705,292 shares × $53.53/share
- Total Cash Outflow = 705,292 × 53.53 = $37,754,960.76
- Total Cash Outflow in Millions = $37,754,960.76 / 1,000,000 = $37.75 million
- Total Number of Shares Purchased: 705,292
- Average Price Paid per Share: $53.53
