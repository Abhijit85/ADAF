=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: For the MTN Group acquisition, what was the cost per tower?

**Calculation**:
1. **Determine Total Purchase Price**: 
   - The adjusted aggregate purchase price for the acquisition is $173.2 million.

2. **Determine Number of Towers Acquired**: 
   - The number of communications sites (towers) acquired is 962.

3. **Calculate Cost Per Tower**:
   - Cost per tower = Total Purchase Price / Number of Towers Acquired
   - Cost per tower = $173200000 / 962

4. **Perform the Division**:
   - Cost per tower = $179937.63 (rounded to two decimal places)

**Answer**: The cost per tower for the MTN Group acquisition is approximately $179937.63.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context and table data.

Answer Echoes:
- The joint venture acquired 962 communications sites for an aggregate purchase price of $171.5 million, which was later adjusted to $173.2 million.
- The table does not provide the number of towers acquired, but the text context does.
- The adjusted aggregate purchase price for the acquisition is $173.2 million.
- The number of communications sites (towers) acquired is 962.
- Cost per tower = Total Purchase Price / Number of Towers Acquired
- Cost per tower = $173,200,000 / 962
- Cost per tower = $179,937.63 (rounded to two decimal places)
