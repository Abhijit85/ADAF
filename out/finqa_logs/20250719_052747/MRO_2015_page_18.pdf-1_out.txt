=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: For 2016, what was the total African and US net undeveloped acres expiring, in thousands?

**Calculation**:
1. Extract values from the table:
   - U.S. net undeveloped acres expiring in 2016: 68 (in thousands)
   - Total Africa net undeveloped acres expiring in 2016: 189 (in thousands)

2. Sum the values:
   \[
   \text{Total for U.S. and Africa in 2016} = 68 + 189
   \]

3. Perform the calculation:
   \[
   68 + 189 = 257
   \]

**Answer**: 257 (in thousands)

**Source**: Table data was used for the exact numbers, and the text context was reviewed to ensure no additional relevant information was needed for the arithmetic calculation.

Answer Echoes:
- U.S. net undeveloped acres expiring in 2016: 68 (in thousands)
- Total Africa net undeveloped acres expiring in 2016: 189 (in thousands)
- **U.S. Net Undeveloped Acres Expiring in 2016**: 68 (in thousands)
- **Total Africa Net Undeveloped Acres Expiring in 2016**: 189 (in thousands)
- The text provides context about the expiration of undeveloped acres and mentions transactions related to Africa, specifically Ethiopia and Kenya. However, for the arithmetic calculation, the specific numbers from the table are sufficient.
- U.S. net undeveloped acres expiring in 2016: 68 (in thousands)
- Total Africa net undeveloped acres expiring in 2016: 189 (in thousands)
- Sum the values: \(68 + 189 = 257\)
