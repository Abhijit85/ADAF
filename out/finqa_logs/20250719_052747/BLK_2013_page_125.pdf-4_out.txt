=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the growth rate in rent expense and certain office equipment expense in 2012 compared to 2011?

**Calculation**:
1. **Extract Data**:
   - Rent expense and certain office equipment expense in 2011: $154 million
   - Rent expense and certain office equipment expense in 2012: $133 million

2. **Calculate the Change in Expense**:
   \[
   \text{Change in Expense} = \text{Expense in 2012} - \text{Expense in 2011} = 133 \text{ million} - 154 \text{ million} = -21 \text{ million}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Growth Rate**:
   \[
   \text{Growth Rate} = \left(\frac{\text{Change in Expense}}{\text{Expense in 2011}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{-21}{154}\right) \times 100
   \]

4. **Perform the Division**:
   \[
   \frac{-21}{154} \approx -0.1364
   \]

5. **Convert to Percentage**:
   \[
   -0.1364 \times 100 = -13.64\%
   \]

**Answer**: The growth rate in rent expense and certain office equipment expense in 2012 compared to 2011 is approximately \(-13.64\%\). This indicates a decrease in expenses from 2011 to 2012.
