=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the percentage increase in interest expense?

**Calculation**:
1. **Determine the Previous Year's Interest Expense**:
   - Current Year's Interest Expense (2022) = $914 million
   - Increase in Interest Expense = $23 million
   - Previous Year's Interest Expense = $914 million - $23 million = $891 million

2. **Calculate the Percentage Increase**:
   - Formula: \((\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}) / \text{Old Value} \times 100\%\)
   - Applying the values: \((914 - 891) / 891 \times 100\%\)

3. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - \[23 / 891 \times 100\% \approx 2.58\%\]

**Answer**: The percentage increase in interest expense is approximately 2.58%.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Since the interest expense increased by $23 million to reach $914 million, we can calculate the previous year's interest expense by subtracting the increase from the current year's expense.
- Previous Year's Interest Expense = $914 million - $23 million = $891 million
- The formula for percentage increase is: \[(\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}) / \text{Old Value} \times 100\%\]
- Applying the values: \[(914 - 891) / 891 \times 100\%\]
- \[23 / 891 \times 100\% \approx 2.58\%\]
