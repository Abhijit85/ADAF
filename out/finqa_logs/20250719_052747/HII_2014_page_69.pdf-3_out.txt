=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the anticipated amount of revenues from the $21 billion total backlog as of December 31, 2014, to be converted into sales in 2015 in billions?

**Calculation**:
1. **Data Extraction**:
   - From Text Context: Total backlog as of December 31, 2014, is $21 billion.
   - Percentage of backlog expected to be converted into sales in 2015 is 28%.

2. **Calculate the Anticipated Revenue Conversion**:
   - Use the percentage provided in the text context to calculate the anticipated revenue conversion.
   - Calculation: \( 28\% \times \$21 \text{ billion} = 0.28 \times 21 = 5.88 \text{ billion} \)

**Answer**: The anticipated amount of revenues from the $21 billion total backlog as of December 31, 2014, expected to be converted into sales in 2015 is **$5.88 billion**.

**Source**: Combined analysis using text context for percentage conversion and total backlog amount.

Answer Echoes:
- Total Backlog = $21,430 million (or $21.43 billion)
- Funded Backlog = $11,832 million (or $11.832 billion)
- Funded Backlog = $11,832 million = $11.832 billion
- Total backlog as of December 31, 2014: $21 billion
- Percentage of backlog expected to be converted into sales in 2015: 28%
- Total backlog as of December 31, 2014: $21,430 million (or $21.43 billion)
- Funded backlog as of December 31, 2014: $11,832 million (or $11.832 billion)
- The text context specifies that 28% of the total backlog is expected to be converted into sales in 2015.
- Total backlog is given as $21 billion in the text context, which aligns with the percentage conversion information.
- Use the percentage provided in the text context to calculate the anticipated revenue conversion.
- Calculation: \( 28\% \times \$21 \text{ billion} = 0.28 \times 21 = 5.88 \text{ billion} \)
- Total backlog: $21 billion (from text context)
- Percentage to be converted in 2015: 28% (from text context)
- \( 0.28 \times 21 = 5.88 \text{ billion} \)
