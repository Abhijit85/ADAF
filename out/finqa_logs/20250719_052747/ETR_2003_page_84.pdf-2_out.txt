=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What amount of long-term debt is due in the next 36 months as of December 31, 2003, in millions?

**Calculation**: 
Given the lack of specific numerical data in both the text and the table regarding the exact amounts of long-term debt due within the next 36 months, we cannot perform a direct calculation. However, we can infer that the text mentions annual installments and maturities, which could be relevant if specific figures were provided.

To accurately calculate the amount of long-term debt due in the next 36 months, we would need:
- Specific figures for the annual long-term debt maturities for the years 2004, 2005, and 2006.
- Any additional context or data specifically related to the amounts due within this period.

**Answer**: Additional context required. Specific figures for the annual long-term debt maturities for 2004, 2005, and 2006 are needed to answer the question accurately. Without this information, we cannot determine the amount of long-term debt due in the next 36 months as of December 31, 2003.

**Source**: Combined analysis (text and table) - insufficient data provided.

Answer Echoes:
- The table does not contain specific figures related to long-term debt or its maturities.
- Specific figures for the annual long-term debt maturities for the years 2004, 2005, and 2006.
- Any additional context or data specifically related to the amounts due within this period.
