=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What portion of total long-term borrowings is due in the next 24 months?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Notes Maturing in the Next 24 Months**:
   - Based on the table, the notes maturing within the next 24 months from the assumed current year of 2015 are:
     - 1.375% Notes due 2015: $750 million
     - 6.25% Notes due 2017: $700 million

2. **Calculate Total Maturity Amount for Notes Due in the Next 24 Months**:
   - Total Maturity Amount = $750 million (2015) + $700 million (2017) = $1450 million

3. **Calculate Total Long-term Borrowings**:
   - Total Long-term Borrowings = $4950 million

4. **Calculate the Percentage of Total Long-term Borrowings Due in the Next 24 Months**:
   - Percentage = (Total Maturity Amount / Total Long-term Borrowings) × 100
   - Percentage = ($1450 million / $4950 million) × 100

**Calculation**:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{1450}{4950}\right) \times 100 = 29.29\% \]

**Answer**: 29.29% of total long-term borrowings is due in the next 24 months.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- The table lists the following notes:
- 1.375% Notes due 2015
- 6.25% Notes due 2017
- 5.00% Notes due 2019
- 4.25% Notes due 2021
- 3.375% Notes due 2022
- 3.50% Notes due 2024
- The current year is assumed to be 2015 (based on the earliest maturity date in the table). Therefore, notes maturing in the next 24 months are:
- 1.375% Notes due 2015: $750 million
- 6.25% Notes due 2017: $700 million
- Total Maturity Amount = $750 million (2015) + $700 million (2017) = $1,450 million
- Total Long-term Borrowings = $4,950 million
- Percentage = (Total Maturity Amount / Total Long-term Borrowings) × 100
- Percentage = ($1,450 million / $4,950 million) × 100
- **Notes Maturing in the Next 24 Months**:
- 1.375% Notes due 2015: $750 million
- 6.25% Notes due 2017: $700 million
- **Total Long-term Borrowings**: $4,950 million
- The context provides additional information about the issuance and maturity of various notes, but the necessary data for this calculation is already extracted from the table.
- Notes due in 2015 and 2017 are maturing within the next 24 months from 2015.
- Total Maturity Amount = $750 million (2015) + $700 million (2017) = $1,450 million
- Percentage = (Total Maturity Amount / Total Long-term Borrowings) × 100
- Percentage = ($1,450 million / $4,950 million) × 100
