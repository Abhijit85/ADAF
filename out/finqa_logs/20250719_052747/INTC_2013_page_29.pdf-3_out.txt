=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the percent of the square feet in owned facilities in other countries?

**Calculation**: 
To find the percentage of square feet in owned facilities located in other countries, we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Base}}\right) \times 100
\]

Where:
- **Part** is the square feet in owned facilities in other countries (16.7 million square feet).
- **Base** is the total square feet in owned facilities (46.6 million square feet).

Substituting the values into the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{16.7}{46.6}\right) \times 100
\]

Performing the division and multiplication:

\[
\frac{16.7}{46.6} \approx 0.35836
\]

\[
0.35836 \times 100 = 35.836
\]

Rounding to two decimal places:

\[
35.84\%
\]

**Answer**: 35.84%

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Owned facilities in Other Countries = 16.7 million square feet
- Total owned facilities = 46.6 million square feet
- **Verify Numbers**: Checked the extracted values from the table.
- **Check Units**: All values are in millions of square feet.
- **Validate Calculations**: Confirmed the mathematical steps.
- **Format Properly**: Result is rounded to two decimal places and includes the percentage symbol.
- **Owned facilities in Other Countries**: 16.7 million square feet
- **Total owned facilities**: 46.6 million square feet
- **Part** is the square feet in owned facilities in other countries (16.7 million square feet).
- **Base** is the total square feet in owned facilities (46.6 million square feet).
