=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the percentage change in cash provided by operating activities from 2014 to 2015?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base**: The cash provided by operating activities in 2014 is $7385 million.
2. **Identify Part**: The cash provided by operating activities in 2015 is $7344 million.
3. **Calculate the Change**: 
   - Change = 2015 value - 2014 value = $7344 million - $7385 million = -$41 million.
4. **Calculate Percentage Change**: 
   - Percentage Change = (Change / 2014 value) × 100
   - Percentage Change = (-$41 million / $7385 million) × 100
   - Percentage Change = -0.555%

**Answer**: The percentage change in cash provided by operating activities from 2014 to 2015 is -0.555%. This indicates a decrease of 0.555% in cash provided by operating activities from 2014 to 2015.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Change = 2015 value - 2014 value = $7,344 million - $7,385 million = -$41 million.
- Percentage Change = (Change / 2014 value) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-$41 million / $7,385 million) × 100
- Percentage Change = -0.555%
- Change = 2015 value - 2014 value = $7,344 million - $7,385 million = -$41 million.
- Percentage Change = (Change / 2014 value) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-$41 million / $7,385 million) × 100
- Percentage Change = -0.555%
