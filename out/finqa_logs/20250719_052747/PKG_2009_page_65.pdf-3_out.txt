=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the change in millions from 2008 to 2009 under purchase commitments?

**Calculation**:
1. Identify the purchase commitments for each year from the text:
   - 2008 Purchase Commitments: $29.4 million
   - 2009 Purchase Commitments: $37.3 million
2. Calculate the change:
   - Change = $37.3 million (2009) - $29.4 million (2008)
   - Change = $7.9 million

**Answer**: The change in purchase commitments from 2008 to 2009 was $7.9 million.

**Source**: Text context (as the table did not provide data for 2008 or 2009).

Answer Echoes:
- **Arithmetic Type**: Difference
- **Data Requirements**: Purchase commitments for 2008 and 2009
- **Context Needs**: Additional information from the text since the table does not provide data for these years
- **2008 Purchase Commitments**: $29.4 million
- **2009 Purchase Commitments**: $37.3 million
- **Calculation**: Subtract the 2008 purchase commitments from the 2009 purchase commitments.
- 2008: $29.4 million
- 2009: $37.3 million
- Change = $37.3 million (2009) - $29.4 million (2008)
- Change = $7.9 million
- 2008 Purchase Commitments: $29.4 million (from text)
- 2009 Purchase Commitments: $37.3 million (from text)
- Change = $37.3 million - $29.4 million = $7.9 million
