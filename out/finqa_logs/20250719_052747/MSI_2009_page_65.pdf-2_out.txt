=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the ratio of the segment net sales in 2008 to 2009?

**Calculation**:
1. **Extract Data**:
   - Segment net sales in 2008: $12099 million
   - Segment net sales in 2009: $7146 million

2. **Identify the Formula**:
   - The ratio is calculated as the net sales in 2008 divided by the net sales in 2009.

3. **Perform the Division**:
   \[
   \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Segment net sales in 2008}}{\text{Segment net sales in 2009}} = \frac{12099}{7146}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Result**:
   \[
   \text{Ratio} \approx 1.693
   \]

**Answer**: The ratio of segment net sales in 2008 to 2009 is approximately 1.693.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- We need to find the ratio of segment net sales in 2008 to 2009.
- Segment net sales in 2008: $12,099 million
- Segment net sales in 2009: $7,146 million
- Ratio = Segment net sales in 2008 / Segment net sales in 2009
- Ratio = $12,099 / $7,146
- Ratio = 1.693 (rounded to three decimal places)
- **Segment net sales in 2008**: $12,099 million
- **Segment net sales in 2009**: $7,146 million
