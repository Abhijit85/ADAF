=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Assuming a FMV of a share equal to 2000, under the pre-December 31, 2007 plan, approximately how many shares would each non-employee director receive annually?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Fair Market Value (FMV) of a Share**: 
   - Given FMV = $2000

2. **Identify the Grant-Date Fair Value of Options for 2007**:
   - Grant-Date Fair Value = $11.19

3. **Calculate the Number of Shares**:
   - Formula: Number of Shares = FMV / Grant-Date Fair Value
   - Number of Shares = $2000 / $11.19

4. **Perform the Division**:
   - Number of Shares ≈ 178.02

**Answer**: Each non-employee director would receive approximately 178 shares annually under the pre-December 31, 2007 plan.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data (grant-date fair value) and text context (FMV of a share).

Answer Echoes:
- Given FMV = $2000
- Grant-Date Fair Value = $11.19
- To find out how many shares each director would receive, we need to divide the FMV of a share by the grant-date fair value of options.
- Number of Shares = FMV / Grant-Date Fair Value
- Number of Shares = $2000 / $11.19
- Number of Shares ≈ 178.02
- Given FMV = $2000
- Grant-Date Fair Value = $11.19
- To find out how many shares each director would receive, we need to divide the FMV of a share by the grant-date fair value of options.
- Formula: Number of Shares = FMV / Grant-Date Fair Value
- Number of Shares = $2000 / $11.19
- Number of Shares ≈ 178.02
- **Accuracy**: The division was performed correctly using the provided FMV and grant-date fair value.
- **Precision**: The result is rounded to the nearest whole number, as fractional shares are typically not issued.
- **Completeness**: All necessary steps and data points were included in the calculation.
