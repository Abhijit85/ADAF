=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Assuming 2010 accrued casualty costs were completely repaired in the following year, what would the repairs and maintenance expense increase to for 2011 in millions?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Accrued Casualty Costs**:
   - Accrued casualty costs for Dec. 31, 2010: $325 million
   - Accrued casualty costs for Dec. 31, 2011: $249 million

2. **Determine the Amount Repaired in 2011**:
   - Since the entire $325 million of 2010's accrued casualty costs were repaired in 2011, this amount is added to the repairs and maintenance expense for 2011.

3. **Calculate the Total Repairs and Maintenance Expense for 2011**:
   - Original repairs and maintenance expense for 2011: $2.2 billion
   - Increase due to repair of 2010's accrued costs: $325 million
   - Total 2011 repairs and maintenance expense: $2.2 billion + $0.325 billion = $2.525 billion

**Answer**: The repairs and maintenance expense increased to $2525 million (or $2.525 billion) in 2011.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Accrued casualty costs for Dec. 31, 2010: $325 million
- Accrued casualty costs for Dec. 31, 2011: $249 million
- **Arithmetic Type**: Difference and sum
- **Data Requirements**: Accrued casualty costs for 2010 and 2011, total repairs and maintenance expenses for 2011
- **Context Needs**: Understanding of how the repair of accrued costs impacts the total expense
- **Accrued Casualty Costs**:
- Dec. 31, 2010: $325 million
- Dec. 31, 2011: $249 million
- **Repairs and Maintenance Expenses**:
- 2011: $2.2 billion
- 2010: $2.0 billion
- The entire $325 million of accrued casualty costs from 2010 was repaired in 2011.
- The increase due to the repair of 2010's accrued costs is $325 million.
- Original 2011 expense: $2.2 billion
- Add the increase due to repairs: $2.2 billion + $0.325 billion = $2.525 billion
- **Total Repairs and Maintenance Expense for 2011**: $2.525 billion
- Accrued casualty costs for Dec. 31, 2010: $325 million
- Repairs and maintenance expense for 2011: $2.2 billion
- Increase due to repair of 2010's accrued costs: $325 million
- Total 2011 expense: $2.2 billion + $0.325 billion = $2.525 billion
