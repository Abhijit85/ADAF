=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: By what percent did the provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income decrease between 2008 and 2009?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Initial and Final Values**:
   - Initial value (2008): 38.4%
   - Final value (2009): 37.1%

2. **Calculate the Absolute Decrease**:
   \[
   \text{Absolute Decrease} = \text{Initial Value} - \text{Final Value} = 38.4\% - 37.1\% = 1.3\%
   \]

3. **Calculate the Percentage Decrease**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Decrease} = \left( \frac{\text{Absolute Decrease}}{\text{Initial Value}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1.3}{38.4} \right) \times 100 \approx 3.39\%
   \]

**Answer**: The provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income decreased by approximately 3.39% from 2008 to 2009.
