=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the percentage reduction in the Loews Common Stock from 2013 to 2014?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base and Part**:
   - **Base**: The value of Loews Common Stock in 2013, which is 126.23.
   - **Part**: The value of Loews Common Stock in 2014, which is 110.59.

2. **Calculate the Reduction**:
   - Reduction = Base (2013 value) - Part (2014 value) = 126.23 - 110.59 = 15.64

3. **Calculate the Percentage Reduction**:
   - Percentage Reduction = (Reduction / Base) × 100
   - Percentage Reduction = (15.64 / 126.23) × 100

4. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - Percentage Reduction = 0.1239 × 100 = 12.39%

**Answer**: The percentage reduction in Loews Common Stock from 2013 to 2014 is **12.39%**.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data.

Answer Echoes:
- **Base**: The value of Loews Common Stock in 2013, which is 126.23.
- **Part**: The value of Loews Common Stock in 2014, which is 110.59.
- Reduction = Base (2013 value) - Part (2014 value) = 126.23 - 110.59 = 15.64
- Percentage Reduction = (Reduction / Base) × 100
- Percentage Reduction = (15.64 / 126.23) × 100
- Percentage Reduction = 0.1239 × 100 = 12.39%
- From the table data, we have:
- **2013 Value of Loews Common Stock**: 126.23
- **2014 Value of Loews Common Stock**: 110.59
- **Base**: The value of Loews Common Stock in 2013, which is 126.23.
- **Part**: The value of Loews Common Stock in 2014, which is 110.59.
- Reduction = Base (2013 value) - Part (2014 value)
- Reduction = 126.23 - 110.59 = 15.64
- Percentage Reduction = (Reduction / Base) × 100
- Percentage Reduction = (15.64 / 126.23) × 100
- Percentage Reduction = 0.1239 × 100 = 12.39%
