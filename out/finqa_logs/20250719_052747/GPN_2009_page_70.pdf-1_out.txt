=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the average yearly amortization expense related to contract-based intangible assets, in thousands?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Contract-based Intangible Assets**: $1031 (in thousands)
2. **Determine Amortization Period**: The text context provides an amortization period range of 3 to 10 years. The average of this range is \((3 + 10) / 2 = 6.5\) years.
3. **Calculate Yearly Amortization Expense**:
   \[
   \text{Yearly Amortization Expense} = \frac{\text{Contract-based intangible assets}}{\text{Average Amortization Period}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Yearly Amortization Expense} = \frac{1031}{6.5} \approx 158.62
   \]

**Answer**: The average yearly amortization expense related to contract-based intangible assets is approximately $158.62 thousand.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- **Contract-based intangible assets**: $1,031 (in thousands)
- **Arithmetic Type**: Average calculation
- **Data Requirements**: Contract-based intangible assets value and amortization period
- **Context Needs**: Amortization period from text context
- **Calculation Steps**: Divide the total value of contract-based intangible assets by the amortization period
- **Exact Numbers**: Contract-based intangible assets = $1,031 (in thousands)
- **Amortization Period**: The text mentions that contract-based intangible assets have amortization periods of 3 to 10 years. For calculation purposes, we will use the average of this range.
- The range is 3 to 10 years. The average of this range is \((3 + 10) / 2 = 6.5\) years.
- Using the average amortization period of 6.5 years:
