=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the net change in unrecognized tax benefits during 2007?

**Calculation**:
1. **Initial Amount at January 1, 2007**: $11825
2. **Final Amount at December 31, 2007**: $23743

To find the net change, subtract the initial amount from the final amount:

- Net Change = Final Amount - Initial Amount
- Net Change = $23743 - $11825
- Net Change = $11918

**Answer**: The net change in unrecognized tax benefits during 2007 is $11918.

**Source**: Table data (most reliable for exact numbers)

Answer Echoes:
- Start with the initial amount: $11,825
- Apply the decreases and increases:
- Subtract the decrease due to prior period tax positions: $11,825 - $3,749 = $8,076
- Add the increase due to prior period tax positions: $8,076 + $15,667 = $23,743
- Subtract the decrease due to lapse of statute of limitations: $23,743 - $3,429 = $20,314
- Subtract the decrease due to change of position: $20,314 - $320 = $19,994
- **Initial Amount**: $11,825
- **Final Amount**: $23,743
- **Initial Amount at January 1, 2007**: $11,825
- **Final Amount at December 31, 2007**: $23,743
- The text provides additional context about the company's tax positions and adjustments but does not directly affect the arithmetic calculation of the net change.
- Initial Amount: $11,825
- Final Amount: $23,743
- Net Change = Final Amount - Initial Amount
- Net Change = $23,743 - $11,825
- Net Change = $11,918
- Initial Amount at January 1, 2007: $11,825
- Final Amount at December 31, 2007: $23,743
- Net Change = $23,743 - $11,825 = $11,918
