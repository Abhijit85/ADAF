=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the total difference, in millions, in 2015 between a 10% increase and a 10% decrease in interest rates?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Values from the Table**:
   - Change in fair market value with a 10% increase in interest rates: \(-\$33.7\) million.
   - Change in fair market value with a 10% decrease in interest rates: \(+\$34.7\) million.

2. **Calculate the Difference**:
   - The difference between a 10% increase and a 10% decrease is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = (+\$34.7) - (-\$33.7)
     \]
   - Simplifying the expression:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 34.7 + 33.7 = 68.4
     \]

**Answer**: 68.4 million dollars

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- For 2015, the change in fair market value with a 10% increase in interest rates is \(-\$33.7\) million.
- For 2015, the change in fair market value with a 10% decrease in interest rates is \(+\$34.7\) million.
- The difference between a 10% increase and a 10% decrease is calculated as:
- Simplifying the expression:
- The total difference in fair market value for 2015, between a 10% increase and a 10% decrease in interest rates, is \(68.4\) million dollars.
- **Change in Fair Market Value with 10% Increase in Interest Rates (2015)**: \(-\$33.7\) million
- **Change in Fair Market Value with 10% Decrease in Interest Rates (2015)**: \(+\$34.7\) million
- 10% increase in interest rates results in a change of \(-\$33.7\) million.
- 10% decrease in interest rates results in a change of \(+\$34.7\) million.
- The difference between the change in fair market value for a 10% increase and a 10% decrease in interest rates is calculated as:
- Convert the subtraction of a negative to addition:
- The total difference in fair market value for 2015, between a 10% increase and a 10% decrease in interest rates, is \(68.4\) million dollars.
- Change with 10% increase: \(-\$33.7\) million
- Change with 10% decrease: \(+\$34.7\) million
- \(34.7 - (-33.7) = 34.7 + 33.7 = 68.4\)
