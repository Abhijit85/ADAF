=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What are the total pension liability adjustments from 2004 to 2006?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Initial and Final Balances**:
   - Balance as of October 1, 2004: $(786)
   - Balance as of September 29, 2006: $(599)

2. **Calculate the Total Change in Pension Adjustments**:
   - Total Change = Final Balance - Initial Balance
   - Total Change = $(599) - $(786)

3. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - Total Change = $187

**Answer**: The total pension liability adjustment from 2004 to 2006 is a reduction of $187.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data.

Answer Echoes:
- **Balance as of October 1, 2004:** $(786)
- **Balance as of September 29, 2006:** $(599)
- The total change in pension adjustments from 2004 to 2006 can be calculated by finding the difference between the balance at the end of 2006 and the balance at the beginning of 2004.
- **Calculation:** $(599) - $(786) = $187
- The result is positive, indicating a reduction in the pension liability.
- From the table data, we have:
- **Balance as of October 1, 2004:** $(786)
- **Balance as of September 29, 2006:** $(599)
- Calculate the difference between the balance at the end of 2006 and the balance at the beginning of 2004.
- **Calculation:** $(599) - $(786) = $187
- The result is positive, indicating a reduction in the pension liability over the period from 2004 to 2006.
