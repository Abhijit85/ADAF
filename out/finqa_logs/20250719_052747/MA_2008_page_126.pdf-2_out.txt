=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the net change in total liabilities for litigation settlements during 2008?

**Calculation**:
1. **Initial Balance as of December 31, 2007**: $404436
2. **Final Balance as of December 31, 2008**: $1736298
3. **Net Change Calculation**: 
   - Net Change = Final Balance - Initial Balance
   - Net Change = $1736298 - $404436 = $1331862

**Answer**: The net change in total liabilities for litigation settlements during 2008 is $1331862.

**Source**: Table data was used for the initial and final balances, ensuring precise numerical accuracy.

Answer Echoes:
- The net change in liabilities is calculated by subtracting the initial balance from the final balance.
- **Calculation**: $1,736,298 - $404,436 = $1,331,862
- **Arithmetic Type**: Difference
- **Data Requirements**: Initial and final balances of liabilities for litigation settlements
- **Context Needs**: Understanding of what constitutes liabilities for litigation settlements
- **Initial Balance as of December 31, 2007**: $404,436
- **Final Balance as of December 31, 2008**: $1,736,298
- The text provides context on various settlements, but the specific numbers needed for this calculation are extracted from the table data.
- **Net Change Calculation**: Subtract the initial balance from the final balance to find the net change in liabilities.
- Initial Balance: $404,436
- Final Balance: $1,736,298
- Net Change = Final Balance - Initial Balance
- Net Change = $1,736,298 - $404,436 = $1,331,862
