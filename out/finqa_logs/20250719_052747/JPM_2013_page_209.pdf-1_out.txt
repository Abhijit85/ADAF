=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In 2013, what was the net trading assets 2013 derivative receivables to the trading liabilities 2013 derivative payable?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Components**:
   - Trading assets – derivative receivables for 2013: $72629 million
   - Trading liabilities – derivative payables for 2013: $64553 million

2. **Calculate Ratio**:
   \[
   \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Trading assets – derivative receivables}}{\text{Trading liabilities – derivative payables}} = \frac{72629}{64553}
   \]

3. **Perform Division**:
   \[
   \text{Ratio} \approx 1.125
   \]

**Answer**: The ratio of trading assets (derivative receivables) to trading liabilities (derivative payables) for 2013 is approximately 1.125.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Trading assets – derivative receivables for 2013: $72,629 million
- Trading liabilities – derivative payables for 2013: $64,553 million
- Trading assets – derivative receivables = 72,629
- Trading liabilities – derivative payables = 64,553
- The ratio of trading assets (derivative receivables) to trading liabilities (derivative payables) for 2013 is approximately 1.125.
- **Arithmetic Type**: Ratio
- **Data Requirements**: Trading assets (derivative receivables) and trading liabilities (derivative payables) for 2013
- **Context Needs**: Understanding of trading assets and liabilities from the financial context
- **Calculation Steps**: Calculate the ratio of trading assets to trading liabilities
- **Definitions**: Trading assets include derivative receivables, and trading liabilities include derivative payables. These are carried at fair value on the balance sheets.
- **Formula**:
- Trading assets – derivative receivables = 72,629
- Trading liabilities – derivative payables = 64,553
- The ratio of trading assets (derivative receivables) to trading liabilities (derivative payables) for 2013 is approximately 1.125.
- Trading assets – derivative receivables: $72,629 million
- Trading liabilities – derivative payables: $64,553 million
- Ratio = \( \frac{72,629}{64,553} \approx 1.125 \)
