**Question**: What is the yearly interest expense incurred from the $375 million note with a fixed rate?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Interest Rate**: The fixed interest rate for the $375 million note is 5.0%.
2. **Calculate the Yearly Interest Expense**:
   - Use the formula for calculating interest expense:
