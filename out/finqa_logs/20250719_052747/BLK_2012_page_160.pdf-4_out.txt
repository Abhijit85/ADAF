=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What portion of tax benefit would affect the effective tax rate if recognized as of December 31, 2012?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Relevant Components**:
   - Additions for tax positions of prior years: $4 million
   - Reductions for tax positions of prior years: $(1) million
   - Additions based on tax positions related to the current year: $69 million
   - Settlements: $(29) million
   - Positions assumed in acquisitions: $12 million

2. **Calculate the Net Change in Tax Positions**:
   - Net change = Additions for prior years + Reductions for prior years + Additions for current year + Settlements + Positions assumed in acquisitions
   - Net change = $4 million - $1 million + $69 million - $29 million + $12 million
   - Net change = $55 million

**Answer**: $55 million

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context. The table provided the specific numerical values, while the text context confirmed the relevance of these components to the effective tax rate calculation.

Answer Echoes:
- We need to consider the changes in tax positions that could affect the effective tax rate. These include additions and reductions for tax positions of prior years, additions based on tax positions related to the current year, settlements, and positions assumed in acquisitions.
- Additions for tax positions of prior years: $4 million
- Reductions for tax positions of prior years: $(1) million
- Additions based on tax positions related to the current year: $69 million
- Settlements: $(29) million
- Positions assumed in acquisitions: $12 million
- Net change = Additions for prior years + Reductions for prior years + Additions for current year + Settlements + Positions assumed in acquisitions
- Net change = $4 million - $1 million + $69 million - $29 million + $12 million
- Net change = $55 million
- The net change of $55 million represents the portion of the tax benefit that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized as of December 31, 2012.
- **Additions for tax positions of prior years**: $4 million
- **Reductions for tax positions of prior years**: $(1) million
- **Additions based on tax positions related to the current year**: $69 million
- **Settlements**: $(29) million
- **Positions assumed in acquisitions**: $12 million
- The text provides additional context about the company's tax situation, but the specific numbers needed for the calculation are all extracted from the table.
- Net change = Additions for prior years + Reductions for prior years + Additions for current year + Settlements + Positions assumed in acquisitions
- Net change = $4 million - $1 million + $69 million - $29 million + $12 million
- Net change = $55 million
- The net change of $55 million represents the portion of the tax benefit that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized as of December 31, 2012.
- Additions for prior years: $4 million
- Reductions for prior years: $(1) million
- Additions for current year: $69 million
- Settlements: $(29) million
- Positions assumed in acquisitions: $12 million
- Net change = $4 - $1 + $69 - $29 + $12 = $55 million
