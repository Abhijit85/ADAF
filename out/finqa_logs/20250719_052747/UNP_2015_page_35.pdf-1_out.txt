=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In 2014, what was the ratio of the cash used for investment to the cash from operations?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Components**:
   - Cash used in investing activities (2014): $4249 million
   - Cash provided by operating activities (2014): $7385 million

2. **Calculate Ratio**:
   - Formula: Ratio = Cash used in investing activities / Cash provided by operating activities
   - Calculation: \( \frac{4249}{7385} \)

3. **Perform Calculation**:
   - Ratio = \( \frac{4249}{7385} \approx 0.5754 \)

4. **Format Result**:
   - Express the ratio as a decimal: 0.5754

**Answer**: The ratio of the cash used for investment to the cash from operations in 2014 is approximately 0.5754.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Cash used in investing activities (2014): $(4,249)$ million
- Cash provided by operating activities (2014): $7,385$ million
- Ratio = Cash used in investing activities / Cash provided by operating activities
- Ratio = \( \frac{4,249}{7,385} \)
- Ratio = \( \frac{4,249}{7,385} \approx 0.5754 \)
- **Cash used in investing activities (2014)**: $4,249 million
- **Cash provided by operating activities (2014)**: $7,385 million
- Cash used in investing activities: $4,249 million
- Cash provided by operating activities: $7,385 million
- Formula: Ratio = Cash used in investing activities / Cash provided by operating activities
- Calculation: \( \frac{4,249}{7,385} \)
- Ratio = \( \frac{4,249}{7,385} \approx 0.5754 \)
- Express the ratio as a decimal: 0.5754
