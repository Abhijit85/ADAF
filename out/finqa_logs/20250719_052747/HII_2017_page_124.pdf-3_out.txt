=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In the number of securities to be issued, what is the ratio of the stock rights from the 2012 plan to the 2011 plan included in these securities?

**Calculation**:
1. **Extract Data from Text Context**:
   - **2012 Plan Stock Rights**:
     - Stock rights: 28763
     - Restricted stock rights: 3075
     - Restricted performance stock rights: 389898
     - **Total for 2012 Plan**: 28763 + 3075 + 389898 = 421736

   - **2011 Plan Stock Rights**:
     - Stock rights: 27123

2. **Calculate the Ratio of 2012 Plan to 2011 Plan Stock Rights**:
   \[
   \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{2012 Plan Stock Rights}}{\text{2011 Plan Stock Rights}} = \frac{421736}{27123}
   \]

3. **Perform the Division**:
   \[
   \text{Ratio} = \frac{421736}{27123} \approx 15.55
   \]

**Answer**: The ratio of stock rights from the 2012 plan to the 2011 plan is approximately 15.55.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context.

Answer Echoes:
- **Data Required**: Specific numbers of securities from the 2012 plan and the 2011 plan.
- **Data Available**: Total number of securities to be issued (448,859) without any breakdown by specific plans.
- **2012 Plan Stock Rights:**
- Stock rights: 28,763
- Restricted stock rights: 3,075
- Restricted performance stock rights: 389,898
- **Total for 2012 Plan**: 28,763 + 3,075 + 389,898 = 421,736
- **2011 Plan Stock Rights:**
- Stock rights: 27,123
- Total number of securities to be issued: 448,859
- **2012 Plan Total Stock Rights**: 421,736
- **2011 Plan Total Stock Rights**: 27,123
- 2012 Plan Stock Rights: 421,736
- 2011 Plan Stock Rights: 27,123
- Ratio = 421,736 รท 27,123 = 15.55
