Answer Echoes:
- Average price per share in 2010: $64.48
- Average price per share in 2011: $81.15
- Difference = Average price in 2011 - Average price in 2010
- Difference = $81.15 - $64.48
- Difference = $16.67
- **Average price per share in 2010**: $64.48
- **Average price per share in 2011**: $81.15
- Average price per share in 2010: $64.48
- Average price per share in 2011: $81.15
- Difference = Average price in 2011 - Average price in 2010
- Difference = $81.15 - $64.48
- Difference = $16.67
