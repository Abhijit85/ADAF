=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the percentage change in fuel surcharge program freight revenue from 2012 to 2013?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Initial and Final Values**:
   - Fuel surcharge program freight revenue in 2012: $2.6 billion
   - Fuel surcharge program freight revenue in 2013: $2.6 billion

2. **Calculate the Percentage Change**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{\text{Final Value} - \text{Initial Value}}{\text{Initial Value}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{2.6 - 2.6}{2.6} \right) \times 100 = 0\%
   \]

**Answer**: The percentage change in fuel surcharge program freight revenue from 2012 to 2013 is 0%.

**Source**: Text context provided the specific values for the fuel surcharge program freight revenue in both years, allowing for the calculation of the percentage change.

Answer Echoes:
- Freight revenues in 2013: $20,684 million
- Freight revenues in 2012: $19,686 million
- Fuel surcharge program freight revenue in 2012: $2.6 billion
- Fuel surcharge program freight revenue in 2013: $2.6 billion
- Initial value (2012): $2.6 billion
- Final value (2013): $2.6 billion
