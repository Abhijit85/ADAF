=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What percentage of future minimum lease commitments at December 31, 2006, for all operating leases that have a remaining term of more than one year are due in 2007?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Total Future Lease Commitments**:
   - Total future minimum lease commitments = $1.1 billion.

2. **Identify Lease Commitments Due in 2007**:
   - Lease commitments due in 2007 = $288 million.

3. **Calculate the Percentage**:
   - Percentage of lease commitments due in 2007 = (Lease commitments due in 2007 / Total future lease commitments) × 100
   - Percentage = ($288 million / $1100 million) × 100
   - Percentage = 0.2618 × 100
   - Percentage = 26.18%

**Answer**: 26.18% of future minimum lease commitments at December 31, 2006, for all operating leases with a remaining term of more than one year are due in 2007.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Future minimum lease commitments at December 31, 2006, for all operating leases with a remaining term of more than one year total $1.1 billion.
- The specific lease commitments due in 2007 are $288 million.
- Total future minimum lease commitments = $1.1 billion.
- Lease commitments due in 2007 = $288 million.
- Percentage of lease commitments due in 2007 = (Lease commitments due in 2007 / Total future lease commitments) × 100
- Percentage = ($288 million / $1,100 million) × 100
- Percentage = (288 / 1,100) × 100
- Percentage = 0.2618 × 100
- Percentage = 26.18%
- Total future minimum lease commitments: $1.1 billion
- Lease commitments due in 2007: $288 million
- Percentage = ($288 million / $1,100 million) × 100 = 26.18%
