=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the ratio of the pension trust assets for 2017 to 2018?

**Calculation**:
1. **U.S. Pension Trust Assets**:
   - 2017: $1739 million
   - 2018: $1572 million
   - Ratio = $1739 million / $1572 million ≈ 1.1063

2. **U.K. Pension Trust Assets**:
   - 2017: $480 million
   - 2018: $415 million
   - Ratio = $480 million / $415 million ≈ 1.1566

**Answer**:
- **U.S. Pension Trust Ratio**: Approximately 1.1063
- **U.K. Pension Trust Ratio**: Approximately 1.1566

**Source**: Combined analysis from table and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Balance as of December 31, 2017: $39 million
- Balance as of December 31, 2018: $39 million
- Ratio = Balance in 2017 / Balance in 2018
- Ratio = $39 million / $39 million
- Ratio = 1
- The balances for both years are equal, so the ratio is straightforward.
- **Verify Numbers**: Both balances are confirmed as $39 million.
- **Check Units**: Both values are in millions.
- **Validate Calculations**: The division is correct.
- **Format Properly**: The ratio is expressed as a simple number.
- **U.S. Pension Trust Assets:**
- As of December 31, 2017: $1,739 million
- As of December 31, 2018: $1,572 million
- **U.K. Pension Trust Assets:**
- As of December 31, 2017: $480 million
- As of December 31, 2018: $415 million
- Ratio = Assets in 2017 / Assets in 2018
- Ratio = $1,739 million / $1,572 million
- Ratio = Assets in 2017 / Assets in 2018
- Ratio = $480 million / $415 million
- Ratio = $1,739 million / $1,572 million ≈ 1.1063
- Ratio = $480 million / $415 million ≈ 1.1566
- **U.S. Pension Trust Ratio**: Approximately 1.1063
- **U.K. Pension Trust Ratio**: Approximately 1.1566
