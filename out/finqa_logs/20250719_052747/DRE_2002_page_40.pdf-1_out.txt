=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the percent change in quarterly cash dividend for the period ended March 31, 2002, to the period ended March 31, 2003?

**Calculation**:
To calculate the percent change in the quarterly cash dividend from March 31, 2002, to March 31, 2003, we need the dividend amounts for both periods.

1. **Dividend for March 31, 2003**: From the text context, we know the dividend declared on January 29, 2003, for the period ending March 31, 2003, was $0.455 per share.

2. **Dividend for March 31, 2002**: This information is not directly available from the provided text or table data. Therefore, we cannot proceed with the calculation without this missing piece of information.

3. **Percent Change Formula**:
   \[
   \text{Percent Change} = \left( \frac{D_{2003} - D_{2002}}{D_{2002}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Where:
   - \( D_{2003} = 0.455 \)
   - \( D_{2002} \) is unknown

Since \( D_{2002} \) is not provided, the calculation cannot be completed.

**Answer**: Additional context is required to determine the dividend amount for the period ended March 31, 2002. Without this information, the percent change in the quarterly cash dividend cannot be calculated.

**Source**: Combined analysis (text context for 2003 dividend, missing table data for 2002 dividend).

Answer Echoes:
- The text mentions that on January 29, 2003, the company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.455 per share, payable on February 28, 2003. This dividend would be applicable for the period ending March 31, 2003.
- The table data is not provided here, but the context indicates that it contains dividend information for the years 2001 and 2002. However, the exact dividend amount for the period ended March 31, 2002, is not directly available from the text provided.
- Dividend for March 31, 2002: \( D_{2002} \)
- Dividend for March 31, 2003: \( D_{2003} = 0.455 \)
