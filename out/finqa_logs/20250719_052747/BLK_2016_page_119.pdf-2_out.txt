=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the interest from 2017 to 2025 as a percentage of the total long-term borrowings?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Interest Amounts**:
   - 6.25% Notes due 2017: Interest = $724 million (Fair Value) - $700 million (Carrying Value) = $24 million
   - 5.00% Notes due 2019: Interest = $1086 million - $997 million = $89 million
   - 4.25% Notes due 2021: Interest = $808 million - $746 million = $62 million
   - 3.375% Notes due 2022: Interest = $775 million - $746 million = $29 million
   - 3.50% Notes due 2024: Interest = $1030 million - $994 million = $36 million
   - 1.25% Notes due 2025: Interest = $742 million - $732 million = $10 million

2. **Calculate Total Interest**:
   - Total Interest = $24 million + $89 million + $62 million + $29 million + $36 million + $10 million = $250 million

3. **Calculate Total Long-term Borrowings**:
   - Total Long-term Borrowings = $4938 million

4. **Calculate Interest as a Percentage of Total Long-term Borrowings**:
   \[
   \text{Interest Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Total Interest}}{\text{Total Long-term Borrowings}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest Percentage} = \left( \frac{250}{4938} \right) \times 100 = 5.06\%
   \]

**Answer**: 5.06%

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- **6.25% Notes due 2017**: Fair Value = $724 million, Carrying Value = $700 million
- Interest = $724 - $700 = $24 million
- **5.00% Notes due 2019**: Fair Value = $1,086 million, Carrying Value = $997 million
- Interest = $1,086 - $997 = $89 million
- **4.25% Notes due 2021**: Fair Value = $808 million, Carrying Value = $746 million
- Interest = $808 - $746 = $62 million
- **3.375% Notes due 2022**: Fair Value = $775 million, Carrying Value = $746 million
- Interest = $775 - $746 = $29 million
- **3.50% Notes due 2024**: Fair Value = $1,030 million, Carrying Value = $994 million
- Interest = $1,030 - $994 = $36 million
- **1.25% Notes due 2025**: Fair Value = $742 million, Carrying Value = $732 million
- Interest = $742 - $732 = $10 million
- **Interest Amounts for Each Note:**
- 6.25% Notes due 2017: $24 million
- 5.00% Notes due 2019: $89 million
- 4.25% Notes due 2021: $62 million
- 3.375% Notes due 2022: $29 million
- 3.50% Notes due 2024: $36 million
- 1.25% Notes due 2025: $10 million
- **Total Interest:** $250 million
- **Total Long-term Borrowings:** $4,938 million
- The text provides additional context about the notes, including their issuance, maturity, and interest payment schedules. However, the specific interest amounts and total borrowings are already extracted from the table data.
- Sum of interest amounts from all notes: \(24 + 89 + 62 + 29 + 36 + 10 = 250\) million dollars.
- Use the formula for percentage:
- Substitute the values:
- Perform the calculation:
- Interest amounts for each note and total long-term borrowings were extracted from the table data.
- Total interest calculated as $250 million.
- Interest as a percentage of total long-term borrowings calculated as 5.06%.
