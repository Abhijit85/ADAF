=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: At December 31, 2015, what was the net change from December 31, 2014, on total purchased impaired loans in billions?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Values from Table**:
   - December 31, 2014: $1558 million
   - December 31, 2015: $1250 million

2. **Calculate the Difference**:
   - Net Change = Value at December 31, 2015 - Value at December 31, 2014
   - Net Change = $1250 million - $1558 million
   - Net Change = -$308 million

3. **Convert to Billions**:
   - Net Change in Billions = -$308 million / 1000
   - Net Change in Billions = -$0.308 billion

**Answer**: The net change from December 31, 2014, to December 31, 2015, on total purchased impaired loans is -$0.308 billion.

**Source**: Table data analysis.

Answer Echoes:
- December 31, 2014: $1,558 million
- December 31, 2015: $1,250 million
- Net Change = Value at December 31, 2015 - Value at December 31, 2014
- Net Change = $1,250 million - $1,558 million
- Net Change = -$308 million
- Since the question asks for the change in billions, we convert the result from millions to billions.
- Net Change in Billions = -$308 million / 1,000
- Net Change in Billions = -$0.308 billion
- **December 31, 2014**: $0.9 billion
- **December 31, 2015**: $0.3 billion
- ALLL at December 31, 2014: $0.9 billion
- ALLL at December 31, 2015: $0.3 billion
- Net Change = ALLL at December 31, 2015 - ALLL at December 31, 2014
- Net Change = $0.3 billion - $0.9 billion
- Net Change = -$0.6 billion
