=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: At the end of 2014, the notional value of derivatives designated as hedging instruments under GAAP was what percent of the fair value?

**Calculation**: 
To determine the percentage of the notional value of derivatives designated as hedging instruments under GAAP relative to their fair value at the end of 2014, we need the specific data for that year. Unfortunately, the table provided only contains data up to December 31, 2013, and the text context does not supply the 2014 figures directly. Therefore, we cannot perform the calculation without additional information.

Assuming we had the 2014 data, the calculation would proceed as follows:

1. **Identify Base and Part**:
   - **Base**: Fair value of derivatives designated as hedging instruments under GAAP.
   - **Part**: Notional value of derivatives designated as hedging instruments under GAAP.

2. **Calculate Percentage**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Notional Value (2014)}}{\text{Fair Value (2014)}} \right) \times 100
   \]

**Answer**: Unable to calculate without the 2014 notional and fair value data.

**Source**: Combined analysis (table and text context) - Additional data required for 2014.

Answer Echoes:
- **Base**: Fair value of derivatives designated as hedging instruments under GAAP.
- **Part**: Notional value of derivatives designated as hedging instruments under GAAP.
- Let's assume the notional value at the end of 2014 is \( X \).
- Let's assume the fair value at the end of 2014 is \( Y \).
- **Notional Value (2014)**: The hypothetical notional value of derivatives designated as hedging instruments under GAAP for the end of 2014.
- **Fair Value (2014)**: The hypothetical fair value of these derivatives for the end of 2014.
- **Base**: Fair value of derivatives designated as hedging instruments under GAAP.
- **Part**: Notional value of derivatives designated as hedging instruments under GAAP.
- The notional value of derivatives designated as hedging instruments under GAAP at the end of 2014.
- The fair value of these derivatives at the end of 2014.
