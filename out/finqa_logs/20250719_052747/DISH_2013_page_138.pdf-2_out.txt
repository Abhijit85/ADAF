**Question**: What is the tax expense related to discontinued operations in 2012?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Pre-Tax Loss and Post-Tax Loss**:
   - Pre-Tax Loss for 2012: $62 million
   - Post-Tax Loss for 2012: $37 million

2. **Calculate the Tax Expense**:
   - Tax Expense = Pre-Tax Loss - Post-Tax Loss
   - Tax Expense = $62 million - $37 million

3. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - Tax Expense = $25 million

**Answer**: The tax expense related to discontinued operations in 2012 was $25 million.

**Source**: Text Context (as the table did not provide data for 2012).

Answer Echoes:
- **Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Before Income Taxes (2012):** Loss of $62 million
- **Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax (2012):** Loss of $37 million
- Pre-Tax Loss for 2012: $62 million
- Post-Tax Loss for 2012: $37 million
- The tax expense can be calculated by finding the difference between the pre-tax loss and the post-tax loss.
- Tax Expense = Pre-Tax Loss - Post-Tax Loss
- Tax Expense = $62 million - $37 million
- Tax Expense = $25 million
- Pre-Tax Loss for 2012: $62 million
- Post-Tax Loss for 2012: $37 million
- Tax Expense = $62 million - $37 million = $25 million
