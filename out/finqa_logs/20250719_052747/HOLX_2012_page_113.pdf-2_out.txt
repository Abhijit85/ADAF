=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the expected yearly stock-based compensation expense over the remaining vesting period, in millions?

**Calculation**:
1. **Extract Data**:
   - Total stock-based compensation to be recognized: $23.2 million (from text context)
   - Remaining vesting period: 3.5 years (from text context)

2. **Calculate Yearly Stock-Based Compensation Expense**:
   - Formula: \( \text{Yearly Expense} = \frac{\text{Total Stock-Based Compensation}}{\text{Remaining Vesting Period}} \)
   - Calculation: \( \frac{23.2 \text{ million}}{3.5 \text{ years}} = 6.628571 \)

3. **Round to Appropriate Precision**:
   - Result: $6.63 million per year (rounded to two decimal places for financial reporting)

**Answer**: The expected yearly stock-based compensation expense over the remaining vesting period is $6.63 million.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context and table data.

Answer Echoes:
- Fair value of stock options exchanged: $2,655
- The table provides the fair value of stock options exchanged as $2,655, but this appears to be inconsistent with the context, which provides a more comprehensive figure of $23.2 million for the options related to stock-based compensation.
- From the text, the total fair value of the stock options to be recognized as stock-based compensation is $23.2 million.
- To find the expected yearly expense, divide the total stock-based compensation by the remaining vesting period.
- Calculation: \( \frac{23.2 \text{ million}}{3.5 \text{ years}} \)
- \( \frac{23.2}{3.5} = 6.628571 \)
- Round the result to two decimal places for financial reporting.
- Result: $6.63 million per year
- Total stock-based compensation to be recognized: $23.2 million
- Remaining vesting period: 3.5 years
- Yearly stock-based compensation expense = \( \frac{23.2 \text{ million}}{3.5 \text{ years}} = 6.63 \text{ million per year} \)
