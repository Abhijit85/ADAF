=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: For the facility leases that have remaining terms through fiscal 2010, assuming the annual rent is approximately that of 2003, what is the remaining total obligation?

**Calculation**:
1. **Annual Rent for 2003**: $823000
2. **Number of Years Remaining (2004 to 2010 inclusive)**: 7 years
3. **Total Obligation Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Total Obligation} = \text{Annual Rent} \times \text{Number of Years}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Obligation} = 823000 \times 7 = 5761000
   \]

**Answer**: The remaining total obligation for the facility leases through fiscal 2010, assuming the annual rent is approximately that of 2003, is $5761000.

**Source**: Combined analysis using text context for the annual rent and lease terms.

Answer Echoes:
- The table provides operating lease payments for the years 2005 to 2009 and a "Thereafter" category.
- The total future minimum lease payments are $4,578.
- The years provided in the table are 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009.
- The "Thereafter" category likely includes payments beyond 2009, but we need to focus on payments through 2010.
- Payments for each year are: 2005: $781, 2006: $776, 2007: $769, 2008: $772, 2009: $772.
- Sum these payments:
- The total future minimum lease payments are $4,578.
- Subtract the payments from 2005 to 2009 from the total future payments to find the remaining obligation through 2010:
- **Arithmetic Type**: Sum and comparison
- **Data Requirements**: Annual rent for 2003, lease terms through 2010
- **Context Needs**: Understanding of lease terms and rent expenses
- **Annual Rent for 2003**: The rent expense for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003, was approximately $823,000.
- **Lease Terms**: The leases extend through fiscal 2010.
