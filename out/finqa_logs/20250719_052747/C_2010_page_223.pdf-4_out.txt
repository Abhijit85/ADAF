=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the gross carrying amount in millions of the company's purchased distressed loan portfolio at December 31, 2010?

**Calculation**:
1. **Initial Carrying Amount**: 
   - Beginning balance of the carrying amount of loan receivable: $920 million

2. **Add Purchases**:
   - Purchases add to the carrying amount: $130 million
   \[
   \$920 + \$130 = \$1050 \text{ million}
   \]

3. **Subtract Disposals/Payments Received**:
   - Disposals/payments received reduce the carrying amount: $(594) million
   \[
   \$1050 - \$594 = \$456 \text{ million}
   \]

4. **Add Accretion**:
   - Accretion adds to the carrying amount: $44 million
   \[
   \$456 + \$44 = \$500 \text{ million}
   \]

5. **Add Increase to Expected Cash Flows**:
   - Increase to expected cash flows adds to the carrying amount: $19 million
   \[
   \$500 + \$19 = \$519 \text{ million}
   \]

6. **Subtract FX/Other Adjustments**:
   - FX/other adjustments reduce the carrying amount: $(50) million
   \[
   \$519 - \$50 = \$469 \text{ million}
   \]

**Answer**: The gross carrying amount of the company's purchased distressed loan portfolio at December 31, 2010, is $469 million.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.
