=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: As of December 31, 2019, what was the percentage of restricted cash that was proceeds from the issuance of tax-exempt bonds?

**Calculation**: 
Given the lack of data for December 31, 2019, in the provided context, we cannot directly calculate the percentage for that specific date. However, we can demonstrate the calculation process using the data from December 31, 2009, as an example:

1. **Identify the Total Restricted Cash**: 
   - Total restricted cash = $236.6 million (as of December 31, 2009)

2. **Identify the Proceeds from Tax-Exempt Bonds**: 
   - Proceeds from tax-exempt bonds = $93.1 million (as of December 31, 2009)

3. **Calculate the Percentage**:
   - Percentage of restricted cash from tax-exempt bonds = (Proceeds from tax-exempt bonds / Total restricted cash) × 100
   - Percentage = ($93.1 million / $236.6 million) × 100

4. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - Percentage = 0.3935 × 100 = 39.35%

**Answer**: As of December 31, 2009, 39.35% of the restricted cash was proceeds from the issuance of tax-exempt bonds. However, without specific data for December 31, 2019, we cannot provide the exact percentage for that year.

**Source**: Combined analysis using text context for December 31, 2009.

Answer Echoes:
- Total restricted cash as of December 31, 2009: $236.6 million
- Proceeds from the issuance of tax-exempt bonds and other tax-exempt financings: $93.1 million
- Total restricted cash = $236.6 million
- Proceeds from tax-exempt bonds = $93.1 million
- Percentage of restricted cash from tax-exempt bonds = (Proceeds from tax-exempt bonds / Total restricted cash) × 100
- Percentage = ($93.1 million / $236.6 million) × 100
- Percentage = 0.3935 × 100 = 39.35%
- Total restricted cash: $236.6 million
- Proceeds from tax-exempt bonds: $93.1 million
- Percentage = ($93.1 million / $236.6 million) × 100 = 39.35%
