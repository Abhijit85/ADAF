=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: The non-recurring charge for the office facility closing was what percent of lease expense in 2006?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Base and Part**:
   - **Base**: Lease expense in 2006 = $1262000
   - **Part**: Non-recurring charge for the office facility closing = $58000

2. **Calculate the Percentage**:
   - Formula: \(\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Base}}\right) \times 100\)
   - Calculation: \(\left(\frac{58000}{1262000}\right) \times 100 = 4.596\%\)

**Answer**: The non-recurring charge for the office facility closing was approximately 4.60% of the lease expense in 2006.

**Source**: Combined analysis using text context for both the lease expense and the non-recurring charge.
