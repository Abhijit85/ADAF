=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What portion of the total interest expense is related to unpaid taxes in 2007?

**Calculation**: 
1. From the text context, we know that the interest expense related to unpaid taxes is $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.
2. However, the total interest expense for 2007 is not provided in the available data.
3. To calculate the portion of the total interest expense that is related to unpaid taxes, we need the total interest expense figure for 2007.

**Answer**: Unable to determine the portion of total interest expense related to unpaid taxes in 2007 without the total interest expense figure. Additional financial data is required.

**Source**: Text context (interest expense related to unpaid taxes), missing total interest expense data.

Answer Echoes:
- The table provides information on unrecognized tax benefits, not on interest expenses.
- There is no direct mention of interest expenses related to unpaid taxes in the table.
- To calculate the portion of interest expense related to unpaid taxes, we would need:
- Total interest expense for 2007.
- Specific interest expense related to unpaid taxes.
- The table does not provide any figures related to interest expenses.
- Without additional data on total interest expenses and the portion attributable to unpaid taxes, it is impossible to calculate the required portion.
- The total amount of interest expense recognized in the consolidated and combined statements of earnings for unpaid taxes is $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.
- The total interest expense for the year 2007 is not provided in the text or table data. This is necessary to calculate the portion of interest expense related to unpaid taxes.
- We have the interest expense related to unpaid taxes: $1.4 million.
- We need the total interest expense for 2007 to calculate the portion.
- Without the total interest expense for 2007, we cannot calculate the exact portion or percentage of interest expense related to unpaid taxes.
- The total interest expense for the year 2007 is needed to calculate the portion of interest expense related to unpaid taxes.
- Unable to determine the portion of total interest expense related to unpaid taxes in 2007 without the total interest expense figure. Additional financial data is required.
