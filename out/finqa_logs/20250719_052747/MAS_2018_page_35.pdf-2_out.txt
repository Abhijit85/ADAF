=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the difference in operating profit margins as adjusted between 2017 and 2018?

**Calculation**:
1. Identify the operating profit margins as adjusted for each year:
   - 2018: 15.1%
   - 2017: 15.7%
2. Calculate the difference:
   - Difference = 2018 margin - 2017 margin
   - Difference = 15.1% - 15.7%
   - Difference = -0.6%

**Answer**: The operating profit margin as adjusted decreased by 0.6 percentage points from 2017 to 2018.

**Source**: Table data analysis.

Answer Echoes:
- Operating profit margin as adjusted for 2018: 15.1%
- Operating profit margin as adjusted for 2017: 15.7%
- Difference = 2018 margin - 2017 margin
- Difference = 15.1% - 15.7%
- Difference = -0.6%
- The result is negative, indicating a decrease.
- Include the percentage symbol and sign.
- **Arithmetic Type**: Difference
- **Data Requirements**: Operating profit margins as adjusted for 2017 and 2018
- **Context Needs**: None specifically needed beyond the table data
- **Calculation Steps**: Subtract the 2017 margin from the 2018 margin
- **Exact Numbers**:
- Operating profit margin as adjusted for 2018: 15.1%
- Operating profit margin as adjusted for 2017: 15.7%
- **Change Percentages**: Calculate the difference between the two percentages
- 2018: 15.1%
- 2017: 15.7%
- Difference = 2018 margin - 2017 margin
- Difference = 15.1% - 15.7%
- Difference = -0.6%
