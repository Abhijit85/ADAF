=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the value of the treasury stock as of December 31, 2007?

**Calculation**:
To determine the value of the treasury stock as of December 31, 2007, we need to calculate the total cost of the shares repurchased during December. The table provides the following information:

- Number of Shares Repurchased in December: 14669

The total value of the treasury stock is calculated by multiplying the number of shares repurchased by the average price per share:

\[ \text{Total Value} = \text{Number of Shares} \times \text{Average Price Per Share} \]

\[ \text{Total Value} = 14669 \times 43.89 \]

\[ \text{Total Value} = 644086.41 \]

**Answer**: The value of the treasury stock as of December 31, 2007, was $644086.41.
