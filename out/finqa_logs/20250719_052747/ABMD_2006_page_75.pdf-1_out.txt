=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the decline from current future minimum lease payments and the following year's expected obligation?

**Calculation**:
1. Identify the total future minimum lease payments: $4819 (in thousands).
2. Identify the expected obligation for the following year (2010): $710 (in thousands).
3. Calculate the decline by subtracting the 2010 payment from the total future minimum lease payments:
   \[
   \text{Decline} = \text{Total Future Minimum Lease Payments} - \text{2010 Payment}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Decline} = 4819 - 710 = 4109
   \]

**Answer**: The decline from the current future minimum lease payments to the following year's expected obligation is $4109 (in thousands).

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data.

Answer Echoes:
- **Total future minimum lease payments**: $4,819
- **Lease payments for 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010**: 1,703, 1,371, 1,035, 710 respectively
- **Arithmetic Type**: Difference
- **Data Requirements**: Total future minimum lease payments, expected obligation for the following year
- **Context Needs**: Understanding of lease payment obligations
- **Total Future Minimum Lease Payments**: $4,819 (in thousands)
- **Lease Payment for 2010**: $710 (in thousands)
- **Decline Calculation**: Subtract the 2010 payment from the total future minimum lease payments.
- Total future minimum lease payments: $4,819
- Expected obligation for 2010: $710
