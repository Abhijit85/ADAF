=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: 2001 revenue from large utilities were how many times the revenues from the growth distribution segment?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Components**:
   - Revenue from large utilities in 2001: $739 million
   - Revenue from growth distribution in 2001: $296 million

2. **Calculate Ratio**:
   \[
   \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Large utilities revenue}}{\text{Growth distribution revenue}} = \frac{739}{296}
   \]

3. **Perform Division**:
   \[
   \frac{739}{296} \approx 2.50
   \]

**Answer**: The revenue from large utilities was approximately 2.50 times the revenue from the growth distribution segment in 2001.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Revenue from large utilities in 2001: $739 million
- Revenue from growth distribution in 2001: $296 million
- Large utilities revenue = 739
- Growth distribution revenue = 296
- The revenue from large utilities was approximately 2.50 times the revenue from the growth distribution segment in 2001.
- Revenue from large utilities in 2001: $739 million
- Revenue from growth distribution in 2001: $296 million
- Large utilities revenue = $739 million
- Growth distribution revenue = $296 million
