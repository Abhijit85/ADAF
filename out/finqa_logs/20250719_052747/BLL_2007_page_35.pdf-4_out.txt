=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Including the shares repurchased under the December 2007 repo agreement, what was the total authorized shares (in millions) eligible for repurchase under the January 23, 2008 repurchase authorization?

**Calculation**:
1. **From Table Data**:
   - As of December 31, 2007, the maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under the plans or programs was 4465344 shares.

2. **From Text Context**:
   - On January 23, 2008, Ball's board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of 12 million shares of its common stock. This new authorization replaces all previous authorizations.
   - The December 2007 repo agreement involved 675000 shares, which were already repurchased and do not affect the new authorization limit.

3. **Determine the Total Authorized Shares**:
   - The new authorization on January 23, 2008, allows for the repurchase of up to 12 million shares. This authorization replaces all previous authorizations, including the 4465344 shares from December 31, 2007.

4. **Include Shares from December 2007 Repo Agreement**:
   - The 675000 shares repurchased under the December 2007 repo agreement are part of the total shares repurchased but do not affect the new authorization limit of 12 million shares.

**Answer**: 12 million shares

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- As of November 26 to December 31, 2007, the maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under the plans or programs was 4,465,344.
- As of December 31, 2007, the maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under the plans or programs was 4,465,344 shares.
- On January 23, 2008, Ball's board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of 12 million shares of its common stock. This new authorization replaces all previous authorizations.
- The text also mentions a forward share repurchase agreement entered into in December 2007, settled on January 7, 2008, for approximately $31 million, which involved 675,000 shares.
- The new authorization on January 23, 2008, allows for the repurchase of up to 12 million shares.
- This authorization replaces all previous authorizations, meaning the 4,465,344 shares from December 31, 2007, are no longer relevant for the calculation of the total authorized shares as of January 23, 2008.
- The 675,000 shares repurchased under the December 2007 repo agreement are separate from the new authorization. However, they are part of the total shares repurchased and should be considered in the overall context of repurchase activities but do not affect the new authorization limit.
- The total authorized shares eligible for repurchase under the January 23, 2008 authorization is 12 million shares, as this is the new limit set by the board.
- Maximum number of shares as of December 31, 2007: 4,465,344 shares (superseded by new authorization)
- New authorization on January 23, 2008: 12 million shares
- December 2007 repo agreement: 675,000 shares (already repurchased)
- New authorization replaces previous authorizations, setting the limit at 12 million shares.
