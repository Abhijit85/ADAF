=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In these equity investment balances, what is the percent of unfunded commitments at December 31, 2013?

**Calculation**:
1. **Extract Unfunded Commitments from Text**:
   - Unfunded commitments for tax credit investments: $802 million
   - Unfunded commitments for private equity: $164 million

2. **Calculate Total Unfunded Commitments**:
   - Total unfunded commitments = $802 million + $164 million = $966 million

3. **Extract Total Equity Investment Balances from Table**:
   - Total equity investment balances at December 31, 2013: $10664 million

4. **Calculate Percent of Unfunded Commitments**:
   - Formula: (Total Unfunded Commitments / Total Equity Investment Balances) × 100
   - Calculation: ($966 million / $10664 million) × 100 ≈ 9.06%

**Answer**: Approximately 9.06% of the equity investment balances were unfunded commitments at December 31, 2013.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- BlackRock: $5,940 million
- Tax credit investments: $2,676 million
- Private equity: $1,656 million
- Visa: $158 million
- Other: $234 million
- Total: $10,664 million
- Unfunded commitments for tax credit investments at December 31, 2013: $802 million
- Unfunded commitments for private equity at December 31, 2013: $164 million
- Total equity investment balances at December 31, 2013: $10,664 million
- Tax credit investments unfunded commitments: $802 million
- Private equity unfunded commitments: $164 million
- Total unfunded commitments = $802 million + $164 million = $966 million
- Formula: (Total Unfunded Commitments / Total Equity Investment Balances) × 100
- Calculation: ($966 million / $10,664 million) × 100 ≈ 9.06%
- Unfunded commitments from text: $802 million (tax credit) + $164 million (private equity)
- Total equity investment balance from table: $10,664 million
- Total unfunded commitments = $966 million
- Percent of unfunded commitments = ($966 million / $10,664 million) × 100 ≈ 9.06%
