=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What portion of the company-owned facilities are located in the rest of the world?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base**: Total number of owned facilities.
   - United States: 43
   - Canada: 3
   - Europe: 11
   - Rest of World: 26

   **Total Owned Facilities** = 43 (US) + 3 (Canada) + 11 (Europe) + 26 (Rest of World) = 83

2. **Identify Part**: Number of owned facilities in the rest of the world.
   - Rest of World: 26

3. **Calculate Percentage**: 
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Base}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{26}{83}\right) \times 100
   \]

4. **Perform Calculation**:
   \[
   \frac{26}{83} \approx 0.3133
   \]
   \[
   0.3133 \times 100 \approx 31.33
   \]

**Answer**: 31.33%

**Source**: Table data

The calculation shows that 31.33% of the company-owned facilities are located in the rest of the world. This result is derived from the table data, ensuring mathematical accuracy and completeness in the calculation steps.

Answer Echoes:
- United States: 43
- Canada: 3
- Europe: 11
- Rest of World: 26
- Rest of World: 26
- **Arithmetic Type**: Percentage calculation
- **Data Requirements**: Number of owned facilities in the rest of the world and total owned facilities
- **Context Needs**: None beyond the table data
- **Calculation Steps**: Calculate the percentage of facilities in the rest of the world
- **Exact Numbers**:
- Total Owned Facilities: 83
- Owned Facilities in Rest of World: 26
- **Composition Percentages**: Calculate the percentage of owned facilities in the rest of the world as part of the total owned facilities.
- Total Owned Facilities = 83
- Owned Facilities in Rest of World = 26
- Total Owned Facilities: 83
- Owned Facilities in Rest of World: 26
- Calculate the percentage of owned facilities in the rest of the world:
- The calculation is reasonable and matches the provided data.
- **Answer**: 31.33%
