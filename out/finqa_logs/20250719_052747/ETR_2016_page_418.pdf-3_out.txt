=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Was the change in net revenue from changes in transmission revenue more significant than the change due to the retail electric price change?

**Calculation**:
1. **Transmission Revenue Change**: $7.0 million
2. **Retail Electric Price Change**: $5.4 million

**Comparison**:
- Transmission Revenue Impact: $7.0 million
- Retail Electric Price Impact: $5.4 million

**Answer**: The change in net revenue from changes in transmission revenue was more significant than the change due to the retail electric price change.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- **Transmission Revenue Change**: $7.0 million
- **Retail Electric Price Change**: $5.4 million
- **Transmission Revenue Impact**: $7.0 million
- **Retail Electric Price Impact**: $5.4 million
- **Transmission Revenue Change**: $7.0 million
- **Retail Electric Price Change**: $5.4 million
- Transmission Revenue Impact: $7.0 million
- Retail Electric Price Impact: $5.4 million
- Compare the two impacts: $7.0 million (Transmission Revenue) vs. $5.4 million (Retail Electric Price)
- The change in net revenue from changes in transmission revenue ($7.0 million) was more significant than the change due to the retail electric price change ($5.4 million).
