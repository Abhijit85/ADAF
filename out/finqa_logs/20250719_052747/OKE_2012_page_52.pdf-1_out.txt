=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What percentage of employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Total Employees**: From the text context, the total number of employees is 4859.
2. **Identify Employees Subject to Collective Bargaining**: From the table data, the total number of employees represented by unions is 705.
3. **Calculate Percentage**: 
   \[
   \text{Percentage of employees subject to collective bargaining agreements} = \left( \frac{705}{4859} \right) \times 100
   \]
4. **Perform Calculation**:
   \[
   \frac{705}{4859} \approx 0.1451
   \]
   \[
   0.1451 \times 100 = 14.51\%
   \]

**Answer**: 14.51% of employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.

**Source**: Combined (Table data for union-represented employees and text context for total employees)

Answer Echoes:
- **Base**: Total number of employees subject to collective bargaining agreements.
- **Part**: Total number of employees represented by unions.
- Employees represented by The United Steelworkers: 406
- Employees represented by International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW): 299
- Total union-represented employees = 406 (United Steelworkers) + 299 (IBEW) = 705
- Employees represented by The United Steelworkers: 406
- Employees represented by International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW): 299
- Total union-represented employees = 406 (United Steelworkers) + 299 (IBEW) = 705
- Total number of employees at January 31, 2013: 4,859
