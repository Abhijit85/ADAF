=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: During 2013, what was the ratio of the accrued interest $1.2 million to the recognized interest liability of $17.0 million?

**Calculation**:
1. Identify the components:
   - Accrued Interest: $1.2 million
   - Recognized Interest Liability: $17.0 million

2. Calculate the ratio:
   \[
   \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Accrued Interest}}{\text{Recognized Interest Liability}} = \frac{1.2}{17.0}
   \]

3. Perform the division:
   \[
   \frac{1.2}{17.0} = 0.070588
   \]

4. Round the result to three decimal places:
   \[
   0.070588 \approx 0.071
   \]

**Answer**: The ratio of the accrued interest to the recognized interest liability during 2013 is approximately 0.071.
