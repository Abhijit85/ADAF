=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the percentage change in the company recognized tax-related interest and penalties in 2011?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Required Data**:
   - 2011 tax-related interest and penalties: $16 million
   - Decrease in 2011: $3 million
   - Therefore, 2010 tax-related interest and penalties = $16 million + $3 million = $19 million

2. **Perform Calculations**:
   - Calculate the percentage change from 2010 to 2011:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{16 - 19}{19} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{-3}{19} \right) \times 100 \approx -15.79\%
   \]
