=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the impact in mmboe resulting from an increase in drilling programs in U.S. resource plays and an increase in discontinued operations due to technical reevaluation and lower royalty percentages related to lower realized prices?

**Calculation**:
1. **Increase from Drilling Programs**: 105 mmboe
2. **Increase from Discontinued Operations**: 67 mmboe
3. **Combined Impact**: 105 mmboe + 67 mmboe = 172 mmboe

**Answer**: The impact in mmboe resulting from an increase in drilling programs in U.S. resource plays and an increase in discontinued operations due to technical reevaluation and lower royalty percentages related to lower realized prices is a combined increase of 172 mmboe.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context.

Answer Echoes:
- From the table, the "Revisions of previous estimates" is given as 5 mmboe.
- The question asks for the impact of specific factors (increase in drilling programs, technical reevaluation, and lower royalty percentages) on the revisions of previous estimates. However, the table only provides a single aggregated figure for revisions without breaking it down into these specific components.
- The table does not provide a breakdown of the 5 mmboe into the specific impacts requested (drilling programs, technical reevaluation, and royalty changes). Therefore, we cannot determine the individual impact of these factors solely from the table data.
- In 2015, the "Revisions of previous estimates" decreased by 2 mmboe.
- This decrease was primarily due to:
- An increase of 105 mmboe associated with drilling programs in U.S. resource plays.
- An increase of 67 mmboe in discontinued operations due to technical reevaluation and lower royalty percentages.
- A decrease of 173 mmboe due to reductions to the capital development program and adherence to the SEC 5-year rule.
- Increase from drilling programs: 105 mmboe
- Increase from discontinued operations: 67 mmboe
- Total increase from these two factors: 105 mmboe + 67 mmboe = 172 mmboe
- The overall "Revisions of previous estimates" decreased by 2 mmboe, which means the net effect of all factors (including the decrease of 173 mmboe) resulted in a net decrease.
- The specific impact from the increase in drilling programs and discontinued operations is a combined increase of 172 mmboe.
- Increase from drilling programs: 105 mmboe
- Increase from discontinued operations: 67 mmboe
- Combined impact from these factors: 105 mmboe + 67 mmboe = 172 mmboe
