=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Based upon outstanding balances at December 31, 2011, what was the percent of the principal and interest product of the combined products?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Base and Part**:
   - **Base**: Total of both products combined.
   - **Part**: Principal and interest product amount.

2. **Extract Numbers from the Table**:
   - **Principal and Interest Product Total**: $7616 million
   - **Interest Only Product Total**: $13107 million

3. **Calculate the Combined Total**:
   - **Combined Total** = Principal and Interest Product Total + Interest Only Product Total
   - **Combined Total** = $7616 million + $13107 million = $20723 million

4. **Calculate the Percentage**:
   - **Percentage** = (Principal and Interest Product Total / Combined Total) × 100
   - **Percentage** = ($7616 million / $20723 million) × 100

5. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - **Percentage** = (7616 / 20723) × 100 ≈ 36.74%

**Answer**: 36.74%

**Source**: Table data was used for the calculation, as it provided the necessary figures for the principal and interest product total and the interest-only product total.

Answer Echoes:
- **Base**: The total of both products combined.
- **Part**: The principal and interest product amount.
- **Principal and Interest Product Total**: $7,616 million
- **Interest Only Product Total**: $13,107 million
- **Combined Total** = Principal and Interest Product Total + Interest Only Product Total
- **Combined Total** = $7,616 million + $13,107 million = $20,723 million
- **Percentage** = (Principal and Interest Product Total / Combined Total) × 100
- **Percentage** = ($7,616 million / $20,723 million) × 100
- **Percentage** = (7,616 / 20,723) × 100 ≈ 36.74%
- **Principal and Interest Product Total**: $7,616 million
- **Interest Only Product Total**: $13,107 million
- No additional context from the text is needed for this specific calculation as the table provides the necessary data.
- **Combined Total** = Principal and Interest Product Total + Interest Only Product Total
- **Combined Total** = $7,616 million + $13,107 million = $20,723 million
- **Percentage** = (Principal and Interest Product Total / Combined Total) × 100
- **Percentage** = ($7,616 million / $20,723 million) × 100
- **Percentage** = (7,616 / 20,723) × 100 ≈ 36.74%
- Principal and Interest Product Total: $7,616 million
- Interest Only Product Total: $13,107 million
- Combined Total: $20,723 million
- Combined Total = $7,616 million + $13,107 million = $20,723 million
- Percentage = (7,616 / 20,723) × 100 ≈ 36.74%
