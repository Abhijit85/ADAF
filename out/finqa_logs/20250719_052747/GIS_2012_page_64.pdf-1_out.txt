Answer Echoes:
- Notes Payable: $412.0 million
- Weighted-Average Interest Rate: 0.2%
- Interest Expense = $412.0 million × 0.2% = $0.824 million
- Notes Payable: $114.5 million
- Weighted-Average Interest Rate: 10.0%
- Interest Expense = $114.5 million × 10.0% = $11.45 million
- Sum of Interest Expenses from both components:
- Total Interest Expense = $0.824 million + $11.45 million = $12.274 million
- U.S. Commercial Paper: $412.0 million × 0.2% = $0.824 million
- Financial Institutions: $114.5 million × 10.0% = $11.45 million
- Total Interest Expense = $0.824 million + $11.45 million = $12.274 million
- Notes Payable: $412.0 million
- Weighted-Average Interest Rate: 0.2%
- Notes Payable: $114.5 million
- Weighted-Average Interest Rate: 10.0%
- Interest Expense = $412.0 million × 0.2%
- Interest Expense = $0.824 million
- Interest Expense = $114.5 million × 10.0%
- Interest Expense = $11.45 million
- Total Interest Expense = $0.824 million + $11.45 million
- Total Interest Expense = $12.274 million
