=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: During 2008, what was the change in average realized price for synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil between the end of 2007 and the end of 2008, per barrel?

**Calculation**: 
1. **Identify Required Data**: 
   - End of 2008 price for synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil: $24.97 per barrel.
   - End of 2007 price is not provided in the text or table.

2. **Extract from Text Context**:
   - The text mentions that the average realized price for 2008 was $91.90 per barrel, which was higher than in 2007, but does not provide the specific end-of-year price for 2007.

3. **Perform Calculations**:
   - Without the specific end-of-year price for 2007, we cannot calculate the exact change in price from the end of 2007 to the end of 2008.

**Answer**: Additional context required: Specific end-of-year price for synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil for 2007 is needed to calculate the change.

**Source**: Combined analysis (text context and table data)

Answer Echoes:
- The average realized price for synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil at the end of 2008 was $24.97 per barrel.
- The text does not provide the exact end-of-year price for 2007 but mentions that the average realized price for 2008 was $91.90 per barrel, which was up from 2007.
- We need the average realized price at the end of 2007 and at the end of 2008 to calculate the change.
- End of 2008 price: $24.97 per barrel.
- The text does not provide the end-of-year price for 2007, only that the average price for 2008 was higher than in 2007.
- Since the end-of-year price for 2007 is not provided, we cannot directly calculate the change in price from the end of 2007 to the end of 2008.
