=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the percentage gain recognized on the commercial mortgages held for sale in 2009?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Initial and Final Values from Table Data**:
   - Initial Value (Dec. 31, 2008): $1401 million
   - Final Value (Dec. 31, 2009): $1050 million

2. **Extract Net Gains from Financial Context**:
   - Net gains recognized in 2009: $107 million

3. **Calculate the Percentage Gain**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Gain} = \left( \frac{\text{Net Gains}}{\text{Initial Value}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{107}{1401} \right) \times 100 \approx 7.64\%
   \]

**Answer**: The percentage gain recognized on the commercial mortgages held for sale in 2009 was approximately **7.64%**.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and financial context.

Answer Echoes:
- **Initial Value (Dec. 31, 2008):** $1,401 million
- **Final Value (Dec. 31, 2009):** $1,050 million
- Since the change in value is negative (-351 million), this indicates a loss, not a gain.
- The commercial mortgages at fair value experienced a **25.05% loss** from December 31, 2008, to December 31, 2009. Therefore, there was no percentage gain recognized; instead, there was a percentage loss.
- **Initial Value (Dec. 31, 2008):** $1,401 million
- **Final Value (Dec. 31, 2009):** $1,050 million
- The text mentions that net gains of $107 million were recognized in 2009 on the valuation and sale of commercial mortgage loans held for sale.
- The financial context states that $107 million in net gains were recognized in 2009 on the valuation and sale of commercial mortgage loans held for sale.
- To find the percentage gain, we need to relate the net gains to the initial value of the commercial mortgages held for sale.
