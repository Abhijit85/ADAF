=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the ratio of the aggregate fair values of our outstanding fuel hedges for 2015 and 2016?

**Calculation**:
1. Extract the fair values from the text context:
   - 2015: $37.8 million
   - 2016: $2.7 million

2. Calculate the ratio of the fair values for 2015 to 2016:
   \[
   \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Fair Value in 2015}}{\text{Fair Value in 2016}} = \frac{37.8}{2.7}
   \]

3. Perform the division:
   \[
   \text{Ratio} = \frac{37.8}{2.7} \approx 14
   \]

**Answer**: The ratio of the aggregate fair values of outstanding fuel hedges for 2015 to 2016 is approximately **14**.

**Source**: Combined analysis using text context for data extraction.

Answer Echoes:
- **2015**: $37.8 million (current liability)
- **2016**: $2.7 million (current liability)
