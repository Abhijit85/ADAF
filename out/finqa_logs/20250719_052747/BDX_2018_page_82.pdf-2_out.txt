=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In 2018, what was the ratio of the service cost to the interest cost?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Components**:
   - Service Cost for 2018: $136 million
   - Interest Cost for 2018: $90 million

2. **Calculate the Ratio**:
   - Formula: Service Cost / Interest Cost
   - Calculation: 136 / 90

3. **Simplify the Fraction**:
   - Result: 136 / 90 = 1.5111 (rounded to four decimal places)

**Answer**: 1.5111

**Source**: Table data (as the numbers were extracted directly from the table, and no additional context from the text was necessary for this calculation).

Answer Echoes:
- **Service Cost** for 2018
- **Interest Cost** for 2018
- **Service Cost** for 2018: $136 million
- **Interest Cost** for 2018: $90 million
- **Calculation**: Service Cost / Interest Cost = 136 / 90
- Simplify the fraction: 136 / 90 = 1.5111 (rounded to four decimal places)
- **Service Cost for 2018**: $136 million
- **Interest Cost for 2018**: $90 million
- No additional context from the text is required for this specific calculation as the necessary data is already provided in the table.
- Service Cost = $136 million
- Interest Cost = $90 million
- Formula: Service Cost / Interest Cost
- Calculation: 136 / 90
- Result: 136 / 90 = 1.5111 (rounded to four decimal places)
