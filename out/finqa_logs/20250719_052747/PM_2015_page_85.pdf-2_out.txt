=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the change in billions of total debt from December 31, 2014, to 2015?

**Calculation**:
1. **Extract Data**:
   - Total Debt at December 31, 2014: $29.5 billion
   - Total Debt at December 31, 2015: $28.5 billion

2. **Calculate the Change in Total Debt**:
   - Change in Total Debt = Total Debt at December 31, 2015 - Total Debt at December 31, 2014
   - Change in Total Debt = $28.5 billion - $29.5 billion

3. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - Change in Total Debt = -$1.0 billion

**Answer**: The change in total debt from December 31, 2014, to 2015 was a decrease of $1.0 billion.

**Source**: Combined analysis using both table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- The table shows two U.S. dollar notes issued in August 2015:
- $500 million with a maturity in August 2017
- $750 million with a maturity in August 2025
- Total debt issued = $500 million + $750 million = $1,250 million
- $1,250 million = $1.25 billion
- Since the question asks for the change in billions of total debt from December 31, 2014, to 2015, and the table only provides the debt issued in 2015, we assume that this issuance represents the change in total debt for the year 2015.
- Change in Total Debt = Total Debt at December 31, 2015 - Total Debt at December 31, 2014
- Change in Total Debt = $28.5 billion - $29.5 billion
- Change in Total Debt = -$1.0 billion
- Total Debt at December 31, 2014: $29.5 billion
- Total Debt at December 31, 2015: $28.5 billion
- Change in Total Debt = $28.5 billion - $29.5 billion = -$1.0 billion
