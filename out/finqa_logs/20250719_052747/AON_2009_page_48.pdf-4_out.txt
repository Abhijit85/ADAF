=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Considering the year 2009, what is the percentage of the segment's operating income among the total operating income?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Required Data**:
   - Segment Operating Income for 2009 = $203 million
   - Total Operating Income for 2009 = $900 million

2. **Perform Calculations**:
   - Percentage = (Segment Operating Income / Total Operating Income) * 100
   - Percentage = ($203 million / $900 million) * 100
   - Percentage = 0.2256 * 100
   - Percentage = 22.56%

**Answer**: The segment's operating income is 22.56% of the total operating income for the year 2009.

**Source**: Combined analysis using table data for segment operating income and text context for total operating income.

Answer Echoes:
- **Base**: Total operating income for the year 2009.
- **Part**: Segment operating income for the year 2009.
- **Segment Operating Income for 2009**: $203 million (as given in the table).
- **Total Operating Income for 2009**: This value is not directly provided in the table. We need additional information to calculate the total operating income.
- **Arithmetic Type**: Percentage calculation
- **Data Requirements**: Segment operating income and total operating income for 2009
- **Context Needs**: Total operating income for 2009 from the text context
- **Calculation Steps**: Calculate the percentage of segment operating income relative to total operating income
- **Segment Operating Income for 2009**: $203 million
- **Total Operating Income for 2009**: $900 million (as mentioned in the text context)
- **Formula**: (Segment Operating Income / Total Operating Income) * 100
- Segment Operating Income = $203 million
- Total Operating Income = $900 million
- Segment Operating Income is directly provided as $203 million.
- Total Operating Income is provided in the text context as $900 million.
- Percentage = ($203 million / $900 million) * 100
- Percentage = 0.2256 * 100
- Percentage = 22.56%
- The calculation is straightforward and uses the correct formula for percentage.
- The segment's operating income is 22.56% of the total operating income for the year 2009.
