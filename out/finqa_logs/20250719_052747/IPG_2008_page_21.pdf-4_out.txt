=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the cash outflow for the repurchase of shares during October 2008?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Total Number of Shares Purchased in October**: 29704 shares.
2. **Identify the Average Price Paid per Share in October**: $5.99.
3. **Calculate the Total Cash Outflow**:
   \[
   \text{Total Cash Outflow} = \text{Total Number of Shares Purchased} \times \text{Average Price Paid per Share}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cash Outflow} = 29704 \times 5.99 = 177868.96
   \]

**Answer**: The cash outflow for the repurchase of shares during October 2008 was $177868.96.

**Source**: Table data.

Answer Echoes:
- **From Table**:
- Total Number of Shares Purchased in October: 29,704
- Average Price Paid per Share in October: $5.99
- **From Text Context**:
- The context provides additional information about the nature of the shares (restricted shares withheld under employee stock compensation plans), but this does not affect the calculation of cash outflow directly.
- Total Number of Shares Purchased: 29,704
- Average Price Paid per Share: $5.99
- Total Cash Outflow = Total Number of Shares Purchased × Average Price Paid per Share
- Total Cash Outflow = 29,704 × 5.99
- Total Cash Outflow = 29,704 × 5.99 = 177,868.96
- Total Number of Shares Purchased: 29,704
- Average Price Paid per Share: $5.99
- Total Cash Outflow = 29,704 × 5.99 = 177,868.96
