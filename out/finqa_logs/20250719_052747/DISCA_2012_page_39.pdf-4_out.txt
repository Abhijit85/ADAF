=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the implied total value of the European sports satellite and cable network as of the transaction date?

**Calculation**:
1. **Transaction Details**: The international networks segment acquired a 20% equity ownership interest in Eurosport for $264 million, including transaction costs.
2. **Implied Total Value Calculation**:
   - If 20% of Eurosport was acquired for $264 million, the implied total value of Eurosport can be calculated by dividing the transaction amount by the percentage acquired.
   \[
   \text{Implied Total Value} = \frac{\text{Transaction Amount}}{\text{Percentage Acquired}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Implied Total Value} = \frac{264 \text{ million}}{0.20}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Implied Total Value} = 1320 \text{ million}
   \]

**Answer**: The implied total value of the European sports satellite and cable network (Eurosport) as of the transaction date is $1320 million.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context.

Answer Echoes:
- The international networks segment acquired 20% equity ownership interests in Eurosport for $264 million, including transaction costs.
- If 20% of Eurosport was acquired for $264 million, the implied total value of Eurosport can be calculated by dividing the transaction amount by the percentage acquired.
