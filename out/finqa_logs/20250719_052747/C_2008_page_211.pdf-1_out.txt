=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the change in millions of carrying amount reported on the consolidated balance sheet trading assets from 2007 to 2008?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Values**:
   - 2008 Trading Assets Carrying Amount: $16254 million
   - 2007 Trading Assets Carrying Amount: $26020 million

2. **Calculate the Difference**:
   - Subtract the 2007 amount from the 2008 amount to find the change.
   - **Calculation**: $16254 million (2008) - $26020 million (2007)

3. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - $16254 - $26020 = -$9766 million

**Answer**: The carrying amount reported on the consolidated balance sheet trading assets decreased by $9766 million from 2007 to 2008.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data.

Answer Echoes:
- **2008 Trading Assets Carrying Amount**: $16,254 million
- **2007 Trading Assets Carrying Amount**: $26,020 million
- **Calculation**: $16,254 million (2008) - $26,020 million (2007)
- **Calculation**: $16,254 - $26,020 = -$9,766 million
- The change is a decrease of $9,766 million.
- **2008 Trading Assets Carrying Amount**: $16,254 million
- **2007 Trading Assets Carrying Amount**: $26,020 million
- 2008 Trading Assets: $16,254 million
- 2007 Trading Assets: $26,020 million
- Subtract the 2007 amount from the 2008 amount to find the change.
- **Calculation**: $16,254 million (2008) - $26,020 million (2007)
- $16,254 - $26,020 = -$9,766 million
- The result is negative, indicating a decrease in the carrying amount of trading assets.
- 2008 Trading Assets: $16,254 million
- 2007 Trading Assets: $26,020 million
- $16,254 - $26,020 = -$9,766 million
