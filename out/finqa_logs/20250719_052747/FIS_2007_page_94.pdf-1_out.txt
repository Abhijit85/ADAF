=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What percentage of total future minimum operating lease payments for leases with remaining terms greater than one year are due in 2009?

**Calculation**:
1. **Extract Data from Table**:
   - Payments due in 2009: $63060
   - Payments due in 2010: $35269
   - Payments due in 2011: $21598
   - Payments due in 2012: $14860
   - Payments due 'Thereafter': $30869

2. **Calculate Total Payments from 2009 Onwards**:
   \[
   \text{Total payments from 2009 onwards} = 63060 + 35269 + 21598 + 14860 + 30869 = 165656
   \]

3. **Calculate the Percentage of Total Payments Due in 2009**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage for 2009} = \left(\frac{63060}{165656}\right) \times 100
   \]

4. **Perform the Division and Multiplication**:
   \[
   \frac{63060}{165656} \approx 0.3806
   \]
   \[
   0.3806 \times 100 \approx 38.06\%
   \]

**Answer**: 38.06%

**Source**: Combined analysis using table data for numerical values and text context for understanding the nature of lease payments.

Answer Echoes:
- Payments due in 2009: $63,060
- Payments due from 2009 onwards: Sum of payments from 2009 to 'Thereafter'
- Payments due in 2009: $63,060
- Payments due in 2010: $35,269
- Payments due in 2011: $21,598
- Payments due in 2012: $14,860
- Payments due 'Thereafter': $30,869
- Payments due in 2009: $63,060
- Payments due in 2010: $35,269
- Payments due in 2011: $21,598
- Payments due in 2012: $14,860
- Payments due 'Thereafter': $30,869
- The text context does not provide additional numerical data for this specific calculation but confirms the nature of the lease payments and their terms.
- Total payments from 2009 onwards calculated as $165,656
- Percentage for 2009 calculated as \((63,060 / 165,656) \times 100 = 38.06\%\)
