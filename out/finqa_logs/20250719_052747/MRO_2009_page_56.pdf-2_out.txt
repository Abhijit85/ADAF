=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the spread between the high and low Henry Hub natural gas prices (in dollars per mcf) in 2009?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Values**:
   - The table provides only one value for Henry Hub natural gas in 2009: $3.99 per mcf.

2. **Determine High and Low**:
   - Since only one value is provided for 2009, both the high and low prices are the same: $3.99 per mcf.

3. **Calculate Spread**:
   - The spread is calculated as the difference between the high and low values.
   - Calculation: $3.99 - $3.99 = $0.00

**Answer**: $0.00

**Source**: Table data

The spread between the high and low Henry Hub natural gas prices in 2009 is $0.00, as there is only one recorded value for that year.

Answer Echoes:
- The table provides only one value for Henry Hub natural gas in 2009: $3.99 per mcf.
- Since only one value is provided for 2009, both the high and low prices are the same: $3.99 per mcf.
- The spread is calculated as the difference between the high and low values.
- Calculation: $3.99 - $3.99 = $0.00
- The spread is $0.00.
- From the provided table data, the only value given for Henry Hub natural gas in 2009 is $3.99 per mcf.
- The table provides only one value for Henry Hub natural gas in 2009: $3.99 per mcf.
- Since only one value is provided for 2009, both the high and low prices are the same: $3.99 per mcf.
- The spread is calculated as the difference between the high and low values.
- Calculation: $3.99 - $3.99 = $0.00
