=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What portion of the adjusted consolidated cash flow for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, is related to non-tower cash flow?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base**: The base is the "Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow," which is $531822.
2. **Identify Part**: The part is the "Non-Tower Cash Flow," which is $(30584). This is a negative value, indicating a cash outflow or loss.
3. **Calculate Percentage**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Non-Tower Cash Flow}}{\text{Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{-30584}{531822} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = -5.75\%
   \]

**Answer**: -5.75%

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context. The calculation shows that the non-tower cash flow represents a negative 5.75% of the adjusted consolidated cash flow for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, indicating a reduction in the overall cash flow due to non-tower activities.
