=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the change in the balance of liability for all restructuring from 2006 to 2008, in millions?

**Calculation**:
1. **Extract Liabilities at December 31, 2006**:
   - Total liability at the end of 2006: $31.8 million

2. **Extract Liabilities at December 31, 2008**:
   - Total liability at the end of 2008: $12.8 million

3. **Calculate the Change in Liability**:
   - Change = Liability at end of 2008 - Liability at end of 2006
   - Change = $12.8 million - $31.8 million
   - Change = -$19.0 million

**Answer**: The change in the balance of liability for all restructuring from 2006 to 2008 is a decrease of $19.0 million.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Total liability at the end of 2006: $31.8 million
- Total liability at the end of 2008: $12.8 million
- Change = Liability at end of 2008 - Liability at end of 2006
- Change = $12.8 million - $31.8 million
- Change = -$19.0 million
- From the table data provided, we have the following liabilities:
- **Liability at December 31, 2006:** $31.8 million
- **Liability at December 31, 2008:** $12.8 million
- Calculate the difference between the liabilities at the end of 2008 and 2006.
- Formula: Change in Liability = Liability at end of 2008 - Liability at end of 2006
- Change in Liability = $12.8 million - $31.8 million
- Change in Liability = -$19.0 million
