=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the value, in millions of dollars, of the total issuable stock in 2014?

**Calculation**:
1. **Fair Value per Share**: $11.75 (from table)
2. **Authorized Shares**:
   - Nonemployee Directors Program: 2.8 million shares
   - Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP): 13.8 million shares

3. **Calculate Total Value for Each Program**:
   - **Nonemployee Directors Program**:
     \[
     \text{Total Value} = 2.8 \text{ million shares} \times \$11.75/\text{share} = \$32.9 \text{ million}
     \]
   - **Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)**:
     \[
     \text{Total Value} = 13.8 \text{ million shares} \times \$11.75/\text{share} = \$162.15 \text{ million}
     \]

4. **Total Issuable Stock Value**:
   \[
   \text{Total Value} = \$32.9 \text{ million} + \$162.15 \text{ million} = \$195.05 \text{ million}
   \]

**Answer**: The value of the total issuable stock in 2014 is $195.05 million.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data (fair value per share) and text context (authorized shares for each program).

Answer Echoes:
- Nonemployee Directors Program: 2.8 million shares authorized.
- Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP): 13.8 million shares authorized.
- Number of Shares: 2.8 million
- Fair Value per Share: $11.75
- Total Value = 2.8 million shares × $11.75/share = $32.9 million
- Number of Shares: 13.8 million
- Fair Value per Share: $11.75
- Total Value = 13.8 million shares × $11.75/share = $162.15 million
- Total Value = $32.9 million (Directors Program) + $162.15 million (ESPP)
- Total Value = $195.05 million
- Fair value per share in 2014: $11.75
- Authorized shares: 2.8 million (Directors Program) + 13.8 million (ESPP)
- Directors Program: 2.8 million shares × $11.75 = $32.9 million
- ESPP: 13.8 million shares × $11.75 = $162.15 million
- Total Value: $32.9 million + $162.15 million = $195.05 million
