=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Does the company spend more on advertising in 2012 than on research and development?

**Calculation**:
1. **Research and Development Expenses for 2012**:
   - From the table data, the "Research and development – total" for 2012 is $468 million.

2. **Advertising Expenses for 2012**:
   - From the text context provided, the advertising costs for 2012 are explicitly stated as $288 million.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Advertising Expenses (2012): $288 million
   - Research and Development Expenses (2012): $468 million

   Since $468 million (R&D) is greater than $288 million (Advertising), the company spent more on research and development than on advertising in 2012.

**Answer**: No, the company did not spend more on advertising in 2012 than on research and development. The research and development expenses were higher.
