=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: How many Class A common stocks issued and outstanding were issued between 2016 and 2017 in thousands?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Values**:
   - Class A common stock issued and outstanding in 2017: 339235 (in thousands)
   - Class A common stock issued and outstanding in 2016: 338240 (in thousands)

2. **Calculate the Difference**:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 339235 - 338240 = 995
   \]

3. **Format the Result**:
   - The result is already in thousands, so no further conversion is needed.

**Answer**: 995 (in thousands) Class A common stocks were issued and outstanding between 2016 and 2017.

**Source**: Table data was used for the calculation, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
