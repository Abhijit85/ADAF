=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What amount of long-term debt is due in the next 24 months for Entergy Corporation as of December 31, 2013, in millions?

**Calculation**: 
To determine the amount of long-term debt due in the next 24 months for Entergy Corporation as of December 31, 2013, we need specific figures for the debt maturities in 2014 and 2015. Unfortunately, the provided context does not include these specific figures. Typically, this information would be found in a detailed debt maturity schedule or a note to the financial statements, which is not included in the provided data.

**Answer**: Additional context is required to provide a precise answer. The specific amounts of long-term debt maturities for the years 2014 and 2015 are needed to calculate the total amount due in the next 24 months.

**Source**: Combined analysis (text context indicates missing data, table does not provide necessary details).
