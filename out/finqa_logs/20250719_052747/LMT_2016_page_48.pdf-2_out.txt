=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In 2016, based on the increase in the net sales, what was the ratio of the increasing factor to the offsetting factors that reduced sales?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Increase in Net Sales**:
   - Net sales in 2016: $17769 million
   - Net sales in 2015: $15570 million
   - Increase in net sales = $17769 million - $15570 million = $2199 million

2. **Identify Offsetting Factors**:
   - From the financial context, the offsetting factor mentioned is a $55 million decrease in net sales due to decreased sustainment activities for the C-5 program.

3. **Calculate the Ratio**:
   - Ratio of increasing factor to offsetting factors = Increase in net sales / Offsetting factors
   - Ratio = $2199 million / $55 million

4. **Perform Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Ratio} = \frac{2199}{55} \approx 39.98
   \]

**Answer**: The ratio of the increasing factor to the offsetting factors that reduced sales in 2016 is approximately 39.98.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Net sales in 2016: $17,769 million
- Net sales in 2015: $15,570 million
- Increase in net sales = $17,769 million - $15,570 million = $2,199 million
- The problem does not provide specific offsetting factors that reduced sales. Typically, offsetting factors could include increased costs, reduced demand, or other financial pressures. However, without explicit data on these factors, we cannot quantify them directly from the table.
- Since we do not have specific values for the offsetting factors, we cannot calculate a precise ratio of the increasing factor to the offsetting factors.
- **Net Sales in 2016**: $17,769 million
- **Net Sales in 2015**: $15,570 million
- **Increase in Net Sales**: $17,769 million - $15,570 million = $2,199 million
- **Offsetting Factors**: The text context provides insight into factors that could potentially offset sales increases, such as decreased sustainment activities for the C-5 program, which reduced net sales by approximately $55 million in 2016.
- Total increase in net sales from 2015 to 2016 is $2,199 million.
- From the context, the only specific offsetting factor mentioned is the $55 million decrease in net sales for the C-5 program due to decreased sustainment activities.
- Ratio of increasing factor to offsetting factors = Increase in net sales / Offsetting factors
- Ratio = $2,199 million / $55 million
- **Ratio Calculation**:
- Increase in net sales: $2,199 million
- Offsetting factor (C-5 program decrease): $55 million
- Ratio = $2,199 million / $55 million = 39.98
