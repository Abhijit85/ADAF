=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the ratio of total flight attendants to pilots?

**Calculation**: 
1. Extract the total number of flight attendants and pilots from the table:
   - Total flight attendants = 24800
   - Total pilots = 15400
2. Calculate the ratio by dividing the number of flight attendants by the number of pilots:
   - Ratio = 24800 ÷ 15400
   - Ratio = 1.6103896103896104
3. Round the result to two decimal places for clarity:
   - Ratio ≈ 1.61

**Answer**: 1.61

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data.

Answer Echoes:
- We need to find the ratio of total flight attendants to pilots.
- Total number of flight attendants: 24,800
- Total number of pilots: 15,400
- Ratio = Total Flight Attendants / Total Pilots
- Ratio = 24,800 / 15,400
- Ratio = 1.6103896103896104
- The ratio is approximately 1.61 when rounded to two decimal places.
- **From Table**:
- Total number of flight attendants: 24,800
- Total number of pilots: 15,400
- Flight attendants = 24,800
- Pilots = 15,400
- Calculate the ratio by dividing the number of flight attendants by the number of pilots.
- Ratio = 24,800 ÷ 15,400
- Ratio = 1.6103896103896104
