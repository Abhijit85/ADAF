=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the percent of the increase in compensation cost recognized for RSUs from 2008 to 2009?

**Calculation**:
1. **Recognized Compensation Cost for 2008**: $4.9 million
2. **Recognized Compensation Cost for 2009**: $7.3 million
3. **Increase in Recognized Compensation Cost**: 
   - Increase = $7.3 million - $4.9 million = $2.4 million
4. **Percentage Increase**:
   - Percentage Increase = ($2.4 million / $4.9 million) * 100 ≈ 48.98%

**Answer**: The percent increase in compensation cost recognized for RSUs from 2008 to 2009 is approximately 48.98%.

**Source**: Combined analysis using both table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- RSUs at December 31, 2008: 401,375
- Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value: $29.03
- Total Compensation Cost for 2008 = Number of RSUs * Grant Date Fair Value
- Total Compensation Cost for 2008 = 401,375 * $29.03 = $11,654,228.75
- RSUs at December 31, 2009: 1,683,606
- Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value: $12.23
- Total Compensation Cost for 2009 = Number of RSUs * Grant Date Fair Value
- Total Compensation Cost for 2009 = 1,683,606 * $12.23 = $20,586,491.38
- Increase = Total Compensation Cost for 2009 - Total Compensation Cost for 2008
- Increase = $20,586,491.38 - $11,654,228.75 = $8,932,262.63
- Percentage Increase = (Increase / Total Compensation Cost for 2008) * 100
- Percentage Increase = ($8,932,262.63 / $11,654,228.75) * 100 ≈ 76.64%
- **2008 Compensation Cost:**
- Number of RSUs at December 31, 2008: 401,375
- Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value for 2008: $29.03
- Total Compensation Cost for 2008 = 401,375 * $29.03 = $11,654,228.75
- **2009 Compensation Cost:**
- Number of RSUs at December 31, 2009: 1,683,606
- Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value for 2009: $12.23
- Total Compensation Cost for 2009 = 1,683,606 * $12.23 = $20,586,491.38
- Compensation cost recognized for RSUs totaled $7.3 million for 2009 and $4.9 million for 2008.
- Increase = Compensation Cost for 2009 - Compensation Cost for 2008
- Increase = $7.3 million - $4.9 million = $2.4 million
- Percentage Increase = (Increase / Compensation Cost for 2008) * 100
- Percentage Increase = ($2.4 million / $4.9 million) * 100 ≈ 48.98%
- Recognized compensation cost for RSUs in 2008: $4.9 million
- Recognized compensation cost for RSUs in 2009: $7.3 million
