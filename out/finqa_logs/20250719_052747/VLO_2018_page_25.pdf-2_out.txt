=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: As of December 2018, what was the percent of the 2018 program still outstanding?

**Calculation**:
1. **Initial Dollar Value of the 2018 Program**: $2.5 billion (as authorized by the board, from text context)
2. **Remaining Dollar Value as of December 2018**: $2.2 billion (from table data)

3. **Percentage Outstanding Calculation**:
   - Formula: Percentage outstanding = (Remaining value / Initial value) × 100
   - Calculation: (2.2 / 2.5) × 100 = 0.88 × 100 = 88%

**Answer**: 88% of the 2018 program was still outstanding as of December 2018.

**Source**: Combined analysis using both table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- The table shows the "Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs" for each month.
- As of December 2018, this value is $2.2 billion.
- We need to deduce the initial value of the program. The table does not explicitly state this, but we can infer it from the changes in the dollar value over the months.
- October 2018: $2.7 billion
- November 2018: $2.4 billion
- December 2018: $2.2 billion
- Initial value (October 2018) = $2.7 billion
- Remaining value (December 2018) = $2.2 billion
- Reduction = $2.7 billion - $2.2 billion = $0.5 billion
- Percentage outstanding = (Remaining value / Initial value) × 100
- Percentage outstanding = ($2.2 billion / $2.7 billion) × 100
- Percentage outstanding = (2.2 / 2.7) × 100 ≈ 81.48%
- **Arithmetic Type**: Percentage calculation
- **Data Requirements**: Initial and remaining dollar values of the 2018 program
- **Context Needs**: Understanding of the stock repurchase program
- **Initial Dollar Value of the 2018 Program**: $2.5 billion (as authorized by the board)
- **Remaining Dollar Value as of December 2018**: $2.2 billion
- **Formula**: Percentage outstanding = (Remaining value / Initial value) × 100
- Initial value of the 2018 program = $2.5 billion
- Remaining value as of December 2018 = $2.2 billion
- Percentage outstanding = ($2.2 billion / $2.5 billion) × 100
- Percentage outstanding = (2.2 / 2.5) × 100
- Percentage outstanding = 0.88 × 100
- Percentage outstanding = 88%
- The calculation is consistent with the context and data provided.
