=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: For the IPL cumulative preferred stock, what was the dividend rate at December 31, 2016, and 2015?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Required Data**:
   - Annual dividend amount: $3 million (from text)
   - Preferred stock value (assumed par value): $60 million (from text)

2. **Perform Calculations**:
   - Dividend Rate = (Annual Dividend Amount / Preferred Stock Value) × 100
   - Dividend Rate = ($3 million / $60 million) × 100
   - Dividend Rate = 0.05 × 100
   - Dividend Rate = 5%

**Answer**: The dividend rate for the IPL cumulative preferred stock at December 31, 2016, and 2015, is 5%.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context.

Answer Echoes:
- IPL preferred stock value for 2016: $60
- IPL preferred stock value for 2015: $60
- **Arithmetic Type**: Percentage calculation
- **Data Requirements**: Dividend amount, par value of the stock
- **Context Needs**: Additional information from the text context
- **Calculation Steps**: Determine the dividend rate as a percentage of the par value
- **Dividend Amount**: The text states that the total annual dividend requirements were approximately $3 million at December 31, 2016, and 2015.
- **Preferred Stock Value**: The text indicates that IPL had $60 million of cumulative preferred stock outstanding at December 31, 2016, and 2015.
- **Dividend Rate Calculation**: The dividend rate is typically calculated as the annual dividend amount divided by the par value of the stock, expressed as a percentage. However, since the par value is not provided, we will assume that the $60 million represents the par value for calculation purposes.
- Annual dividend amount: $3 million
- Preferred stock value (assumed par value): $60 million
- Dividend Rate = (Annual Dividend Amount / Preferred Stock Value) × 100
- Dividend Rate = ($3 million / $60 million) × 100
- Dividend Rate = 0.05 × 100
- Dividend Rate = 5%
- The calculation appears reasonable given the context and the assumption that the preferred stock value represents the par value.
- The dividend rate for the IPL cumulative preferred stock at December 31, 2016, and 2015, is 5%.
- Annual dividend amount: $3 million (from text)
- Preferred stock value: $60 million (assumed par value from text)
- Dividend Rate = ($3 million / $60 million) × 100 = 5%
