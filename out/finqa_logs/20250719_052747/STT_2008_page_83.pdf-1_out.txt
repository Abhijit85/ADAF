=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the average variance of the value at risk of each 2008 section? ( $ )

**Calculation**:
1. **Foreign Exchange Products (2008)**:
   - Maximum VaR: $4.7 million
   - Minimum VaR: $0.3 million
   - Variance = Maximum - Minimum = $4.7 million - $0.3 million = $4.4 million

2. **Interest-rate Products (2008)**:
   - Maximum VaR: $2.4 million
   - Minimum VaR: $0.6 million
   - Variance = Maximum - Minimum = $2.4 million - $0.6 million = $1.8 million

3. **Calculate Total Variance for 2008**:
   - Total Variance = Variance of Foreign Exchange Products + Variance of Interest-rate Products
   - Total Variance = $4.4 million + $1.8 million = $6.2 million

4. **Calculate Average Variance**:
   - Number of Product Categories = 2
   - Average Variance = Total Variance / Number of Product Categories
   - Average Variance = $6.2 million / 2 = $3.1 million

**Answer**: $3.1 million

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Maximum: $4.7 million
- Minimum: $0.3 million
- Variance = Maximum - Minimum = $4.7 - $0.3 = $4.4 million
- Maximum: $2.4 million
- Minimum: $0.6 million
- Variance = Maximum - Minimum = $2.4 - $0.6 = $1.8 million
- Total Variance = Variance of Foreign Exchange Products + Variance of Interest-rate Products
- Total Variance = $4.4 million + $1.8 million = $6.2 million
- Number of Product Categories = 2
- Average Variance = Total Variance / Number of Product Categories
- Average Variance = $6.2 million / 2 = $3.1 million
- Foreign Exchange Products Variance: $4.7 - $0.3 = $4.4 million
- Interest-rate Products Variance: $2.4 - $0.6 = $1.8 million
- Average Variance: ($4.4 million + $1.8 million) / 2 = $3.1 million
- **Foreign Exchange Products (2008):**
- Maximum VaR: $4.7 million
- Minimum VaR: $0.3 million
- Variance: $4.7 million - $0.3 million = $4.4 million
- **Interest-rate Products (2008):**
- Maximum VaR: $2.4 million
- Minimum VaR: $0.6 million
- Variance: $2.4 million - $0.6 million = $1.8 million
- The context provides an understanding of how VaR is used and tested but does not provide additional numerical data needed for this specific calculation.
- Total Variance = Variance of Foreign Exchange Products + Variance of Interest-rate Products
- Total Variance = $4.4 million + $1.8 million = $6.2 million
- Number of Product Categories = 2 (Foreign Exchange Products and Interest-rate Products)
- Average Variance = Total Variance / Number of Product Categories
- Average Variance = $6.2 million / 2 = $3.1 million
- Foreign Exchange Products Variance: $4.4 million
- Interest-rate Products Variance: $1.8 million
- Total Variance = $6.2 million
- Average Variance = $3.1 million
