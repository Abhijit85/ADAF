=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the percentage change in research and development net from 2011 to 2012?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Base and Part**:
   - Base (2011): $428 million
   - Part (2012): $453 million

2. **Calculate the Change**:
   - Change = Part - Base = $453 million - $428 million = $25 million

3. **Calculate the Percentage Change**:
   - Percentage Change = (Change / Base) × 100
   - Percentage Change = ($25 million / $428 million) × 100

4. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - Percentage Change = (25 / 428) × 100 ≈ 5.84%

**Answer**: The percentage change in research and development net from 2011 to 2012 was approximately 5.84%.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- **Base (2011)**: $428 million
- **Part (2012)**: $453 million
- **Change**: Part - Base = $453 million - $428 million = $25 million
- **Percentage Change**: (Change / Base) × 100 = ($25 million / $428 million) × 100
- **Percentage Change**: (25 / 428) × 100 ≈ 5.84%
- **Base (2011)**: $428 million
- **Part (2012)**: $453 million
- Base (2011): $428 million
- Part (2012): $453 million
- Change = Part - Base = $453 million - $428 million = $25 million
- Percentage Change = (Change / Base) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($25 million / $428 million) × 100
- Percentage Change = (25 / 428) × 100 ≈ 5.84%
