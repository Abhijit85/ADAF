=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the increase in long-term debt between 2004 and 2005 in thousands?

**Calculation**:
1. Identify the long-term debt values:
   - Long-term debt in 2005: $3451276
   - Long-term debt in 2004: $3155228

2. Calculate the difference:
   - Increase in long-term debt = Long-term debt in 2005 - Long-term debt in 2004
   - Increase = $3451276 - $3155228 = $296048

3. Convert the increase to thousands:
   - Increase in thousands = $296048 / 1000 = 296.048

**Answer**: 296.048 thousand

**Source**: Table data analysis

Answer Echoes:
- Long-term debt in 2005: $3,451,276
- Long-term debt in 2004: $3,155,228
- Increase in long-term debt = Long-term debt in 2005 - Long-term debt in 2004
- Increase = $3,451,276 - $3,155,228
- Increase = $296,048
- Since the question asks for the increase in thousands, we divide the result by 1,000:
- Increase in thousands = $296,048 / 1,000 = 296.048
- **Arithmetic Type**: Difference
- **Data Requirements**: Long-term debt values for 2004 and 2005
- **Context Needs**: None specifically required beyond the table data
- **Calculation Steps**: Simple subtraction followed by division for thousands
- **Exact Numbers**:
- Long-term debt in 2005: $3,451,276
- Long-term debt in 2004: $3,155,228
- Increase in long-term debt = Long-term debt in 2005 - Long-term debt in 2004
- Increase = $3,451,276 - $3,155,228
- Increase = $296,048
- Since the question asks for the increase in thousands, divide the result by 1,000:
- Increase in thousands = $296,048 / 1,000 = 296.048
- Long-term debt in 2005: $3,451,276
- Long-term debt in 2004: $3,155,228
- $3,451,276 - $3,155,228 = $296,048
- $296,048 / 1,000 = 296.048
