=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the growth rate in the price of shares from the highest value during the quarter ended December 31, 2010, to the closing price on February 11, 2011?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Initial and Final Prices**:
   - Initial Price (Highest value during the quarter ended December 31, 2010): $53.14
   - Final Price (Closing price on February 11, 2011): $56.73

2. **Calculate the Growth Rate**:
   - Use the formula for growth rate: 
     \[
     \text{Growth Rate} = \left(\frac{\text{Final Price} - \text{Initial Price}}{\text{Initial Price}}\right) \times 100
     \]
   - Plug in the values:
     \[
     \text{Growth Rate} = \left(\frac{56.73 - 53.14}{53.14}\right) \times 100
     \]

3. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - Calculate the difference: \(56.73 - 53.14 = 3.59\)
   - Divide by the initial price: \(\frac{3.59}{53.14} \approx 0.0676\)
   - Convert to percentage: \(0.0676 \times 100 = 6.76\%\)

**Answer**: The growth rate in the price of shares from the highest value during the quarter ended December 31, 2010, to the closing price on February 11, 2011, is 6.76%.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data (highest value) and text context (closing price).

Answer Echoes:
- **Highest value during the quarter ended December 31, 2010**: $53.14
- **Closing price on February 11, 2011**: $56.73
- Initial Price (December 31, 2010): $53.14
- Final Price (February 11, 2011): $56.73
- The formula for growth rate is:
- Plug in the values:
- Calculate the difference: \(56.73 - 53.14 = 3.59\)
- Divide by the initial price: \(\frac{3.59}{53.14} \approx 0.0676\)
- Convert to percentage: \(0.0676 \times 100 = 6.76\%\)
- Highest value during the quarter ended December 31, 2010: $53.14
- Closing price on February 11, 2011: $56.73
- Growth Rate = \(\left(\frac{56.73 - 53.14}{53.14}\right) \times 100 = 6.76\%\)
