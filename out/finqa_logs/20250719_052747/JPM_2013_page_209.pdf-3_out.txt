=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What were net trading assets from derivatives in 2012, in millions?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Trading Assets from Derivatives for 2012**:
   - Trading assets – derivative receivables: $85744 million

2. **Identify Trading Liabilities from Derivatives for 2012**:
   - Trading liabilities – derivative payables: $76162 million

3. **Calculate Net Trading Assets from Derivatives**:
   - Net trading assets = Trading assets – derivative receivables - Trading liabilities – derivative payables
   - Net trading assets = $85744 million - $76162 million

4. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - Net trading assets = $9582 million

**Answer**: $9582 million

**Source**: Table data was used to extract the numerical values for trading assets and liabilities related to derivatives, ensuring the calculation is based on reliable and precise figures.

Answer Echoes:
- Trading assets – derivative receivables: $85,744 million
- Trading liabilities – derivative payables: $76,162 million
- Net trading assets = Trading assets – derivative receivables - Trading liabilities – derivative payables
- Net trading assets = $85,744 million - $76,162 million
- Net trading assets = $9,582 million
- Trading assets – derivative receivables for 2012: $85,744 million
- Trading liabilities – derivative payables for 2012: $76,162 million
- The text provides context on how trading assets and liabilities are defined and managed, but no additional numerical data is needed for this specific calculation.
- Trading assets from derivatives: $85,744 million
- Trading liabilities from derivatives: $76,162 million
- Formula: Net trading assets = Trading assets – derivative receivables - Trading liabilities – derivative payables
- Calculation: $85,744 million - $76,162 million = $9,582 million
