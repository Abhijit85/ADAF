=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the percentage change in capital expenditures for property, plant, and equipment from 2009 to 2010?

**Calculation**:
1. Identify the capital expenditures for each year:
   - 2009: $852 million
   - 2010: $820 million

2. Use the percentage change formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{\text{Value in 2010} - \text{Value in 2009}}{\text{Value in 2009}} \right) \times 100
   \]

3. Substitute the values:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{820 - 852}{852} \right) \times 100
   \]

4. Calculate the difference:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 820 - 852 = -32
   \]

5. Calculate the percentage change:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{-32}{852} \right) \times 100 \approx -3.76\%
   \]

**Answer**: The percentage change in capital expenditures for property, plant, and equipment from 2009 to 2010 was a decrease of 3.76%.

**Source**: Combined analysis using text context for specific capital expenditure values.

Answer Echoes:
- Capital expenditures for property, plant, and equipment in 2010: $820 million
- Capital expenditures for property, plant, and equipment in 2009: $852 million
