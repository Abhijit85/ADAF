=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the change in the warranty reserve in 2017 in thousands?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Values**:
   - Balance as of January 1, 2017: $19634
   - Balance as of December 31, 2017: $23151

2. **Calculate the Change**:
   - Change in warranty reserve = Balance at end of 2017 - Balance at start of 2017
   - Change = $23151 - $19634

3. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - Change = $23151 - $19634 = $3517

4. **Convert to Thousands**:
   - Since the question asks for the change in thousands, divide the result by 1000.
   - Change in thousands = $3517 / 1000 = 3.517

**Answer**: 3.517 thousand

**Source**: Table data was used to extract the beginning and ending balances for the warranty reserve in 2017, ensuring the calculation is based on reliable numerical data.

Answer Echoes:
- Balance as of January 1, 2017: $19,634
- Balance as of December 31, 2017: $23,151
- Change in warranty reserve = Balance at end of 2017 - Balance at start of 2017
- Change = $23,151 - $19,634
- Change = $23,151 - $19,634 = $3,517
- Since the question asks for the change in thousands, divide the result by 1,000.
- Change in thousands = $3,517 / 1,000 = 3.517
- **From Table**:
- Balance as of January 1, 2017: $19,634
- Balance as of December 31, 2017: $23,151
- Change in warranty reserve = Balance at end of 2017 - Balance at start of 2017
- Change = $23,151 - $19,634
- Change = $23,151 - $19,634 = $3,517
- Since the result needs to be in thousands, divide the result by 1,000.
- Change in thousands = $3,517 / 1,000 = 3.517
