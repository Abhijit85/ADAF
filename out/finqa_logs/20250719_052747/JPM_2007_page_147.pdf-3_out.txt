=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: How much of the firm-sponsored QSPEs that hold ASF framework loans are serviced by the firm?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Total QSPEs**: From the text context, the total amount of assets owned by firm-sponsored QSPEs that hold ASF framework loans is $20.0 billion.
2. **Identify Portion Serviced by the Firm**: The text context specifies that $9.7 billion of the ASF framework loans are serviced by the firm.
3. **Calculate the Percentage Serviced by the Firm**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Serviced by Firm} = \left( \frac{9.7}{20.0} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage Serviced by Firm} = 0.485 \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage Serviced by Firm} = 48.5\%
   \]

**Answer**: 48.5% of the firm-sponsored QSPEs that hold ASF framework loans are serviced by the firm.
