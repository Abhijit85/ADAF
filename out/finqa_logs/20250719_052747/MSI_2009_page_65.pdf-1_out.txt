=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In 2009, what was the company's consolidated net sales in billions?

**Calculation**:
1. **Extract Data from Text**:
   - The mobile devices segment's net sales for 2009 were $7.1 billion, representing 32% of the company's consolidated net sales.

2. **Extract Data from Table**:
   - The segment net sales for 2009 is given as $7146 million, which is equivalent to $7.146 billion when converted from millions to billions.

3. **Calculate Total Consolidated Net Sales**:
   - Let \( X \) be the total consolidated net sales in billions.
   - Given that $7.146 billion represents 32% of \( X \), we can set up the equation:
     \[
     0.32 \times X = 7.146
     \]
   - Solve for \( X \):
     \[
     X = \frac{7.146}{0.32} = 22.33125
     \]

**Answer**: The company's consolidated net sales in 2009 were approximately 22.33 billion dollars.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- From the table, the segment net sales for 2009 is given as $7,146 million.
- Since 1 billion equals 1,000 million, we convert the net sales from millions to billions by dividing by 1,000.
- Calculation: \( \frac{7,146 \text{ million}}{1,000} = 7.146 \text{ billion} \)
- The mobile devices segment's net sales for 2009 were $7.1 billion, representing 32% of the company's consolidated net sales.
- The segment net sales for 2009 is given as $7,146 million, which is equivalent to $7.146 billion when converted from millions to billions.
- Let \( X \) be the total consolidated net sales in billions.
- Given that $7.146 billion represents 32% of \( X \), we can set up the equation:
- Solve for \( X \):
- Mobile devices segment net sales: $7.146 billion (32% of total)
- Total consolidated net sales = \( \frac{7.146}{0.32} = 22.33125 \) billion
