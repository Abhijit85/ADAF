=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In 2017, what was the amount of net sales applicable to the international market in millions?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Required Data**: We need the total net sales for 2017.
2. **Extract from Text**: The text provides that 26% of net sales were international.
3. **Assume Total Net Sales for 2017**: Let's assume the total net sales for 2017 is \( X \) million USD (since the exact figure is not provided in the text or table).
4. **Calculate International Sales**: 
   \[
   \text{International Sales} = 0.26 \times X
   \]

Since the exact total net sales figure \( X \) is not provided in the context or table, we cannot compute the exact amount of international sales in millions.

**Answer**: Additional context required. To calculate the exact amount of net sales applicable to the international market in 2017, we need the total net sales figure for 2017. If this figure is available, the calculation can be completed using the formula provided.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context.

Answer Echoes:
- **Arithmetic Type**: Percentage calculation
- **Data Requirements**: Total net sales for 2017 and the percentage of sales to international markets
- **Context Needs**: Percentage of net sales attributed to international markets in 2017
- **International Sales Percentage**: The text states that approximately 26% of 2017 net sales were to international markets.
- The table data is not directly provided, but we need the total net sales figure for 2017 to calculate the international sales amount.
- **International Sales Calculation**: Use the percentage of international sales to calculate the actual sales amount.
