=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: For U.S. federal purposes, how many years are currently involved in IRS controversies?

**Calculation**:
1. **Text Context**: The company is under continuous examination by the IRS for tax years 1999 through 2013. Additionally, the IRS appeals office is reviewing issues for tax years 1999 to 2005, and the IRS field examination for tax years 2006 to 2008 is substantially completed.
2. **Table Data**: The table provides balances for unrecognized tax benefits for the years 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014.
3. **Overlap Analysis**: The years 2011, 2012, and 2013 are explicitly mentioned in both the table data and the text as being involved in IRS controversies. The year 2014 is included in the table data but not explicitly mentioned in the text as being under IRS examination for the same period.

**Answer**: 3 years (2011, 2012, and 2013) are currently involved in IRS controversies for U.S. federal purposes.

**Source**: Combined analysis of table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- **Years Involved**: The table explicitly covers the years 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014. These are the years for which tax positions have been adjusted and are thus involved in IRS controversies.
- Balance at December 31, 2011: $4,045 million
- Balance at December 31, 2012: $4,065 million
- Balance at December 31, 2013: $4,096 million
- Balance at December 31, 2014: $2,228 million
- The text states that the company is under IRS examination for tax years 1999 through 2013.
- The table data shows changes in tax positions for the years 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014.
- The years 2011, 2012, and 2013 are explicitly mentioned in both the table data and the text as being involved in IRS controversies.
- The year 2014 is included in the table data but not explicitly mentioned in the text as being under IRS examination for the same period.
- Based on the text and table data, the years 2011, 2012, and 2013 are involved in IRS controversies.
- The year 2014 is involved in the context of changes in tax positions but not explicitly mentioned as under IRS examination for the same period.
