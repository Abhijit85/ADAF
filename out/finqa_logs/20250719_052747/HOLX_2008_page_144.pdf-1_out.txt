=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the estimated price of Hologic common stock used in the acquisition of Suros?

**Calculation**:
1. From the text context, we know that 4600 shares of Hologic common stock were used in the acquisition, valued at $106500.
2. To find the estimated price per share, divide the total value of the stock by the number of shares issued:
   - Estimated price per share = $106500 รท 4600 shares
   - Estimated price per share = $23.15

**Answer**: The estimated price of Hologic common stock used in the acquisition of Suros is $23.15 per share.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context and table data.

Answer Echoes:
- Net tangible assets acquired: $13,100
- In-process research and development: $4,900
- Developed technology and know-how: $46,000
- Customer relationship: $17,900
- Trade name: $5,800
- Deferred income taxes: $(21,300) (negative value)
- Goodwill: $181,700
- Sum = $13,100 + $4,900 + $46,000 + $17,900 + $5,800 - $21,300 + $181,700
- Sum = $248,100
- The sum of the components ($248,100) matches the final purchase price listed in the table.
- Since the sum of the components equals the final purchase price, it implies that the entire acquisition cost is accounted for by the listed components. Therefore, there is no separate line item or additional context provided in the table that specifies the use of Hologic common stock in the acquisition.
- The acquisition of Suros Surgical Systems, Inc. was completed with an initial aggregate purchase price of approximately $248,100.
- This purchase price consisted of:
- 4,600 shares of Hologic common stock valued at $106,500.
- Cash paid of $139,000.
- Approximately $2,600 for acquisition-related fees and expenses.
- The table outlines the components of the final purchase price, which sums up to $248,100, matching the initial aggregate purchase price mentioned in the text.
- From the text, we know that 4,600 shares of Hologic common stock were valued at $106,500.
- To find the estimated price per share of Hologic common stock, we divide the total value of the stock by the number of shares issued.
- Calculation: $106,500 รท 4,600 shares = $23.15 per share
- From text: 4,600 shares valued at $106,500.
- From table: Total purchase price components sum to $248,100.
- Estimated price per share = $106,500 รท 4,600 = $23.15
