=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: As of May 31, 2016, what percentage of cash and cash equivalents was held in foreign subsidiaries?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Total Cash and Equivalents**: $5.5 billion.
2. **Identify the Cash Held by Foreign Subsidiaries**: $4.6 billion.
3. **Calculate the Percentage**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage held in foreign subsidiaries} = \left(\frac{\text{Cash held by foreign subsidiaries}}{\text{Total cash and equivalents}}\right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   = \left(\frac{4.6 \text{ billion}}{5.5 \text{ billion}}\right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   = 0.8364 \times 100
   \]
   \[
   = 83.64\%
   \]

**Answer**: 83.64% of cash and cash equivalents was held in foreign subsidiaries as of May 31, 2016.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context, as the table did not provide the necessary data.
