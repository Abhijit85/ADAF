=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the percent change in earnings for non-utility nuclear from 2001 to 2002?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Initial and Final Values**:
   - Initial value (2001 earnings): $128 million
   - Final value (2002 earnings): $201 million

2. **Calculate the Change in Earnings**:
   \[
   \text{Change in earnings} = \text{Final value} - \text{Initial value} = 201 - 128 = 73 \text{ million dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Percent Change**:
   \[
   \text{Percent change} = \left(\frac{\text{Change in earnings}}{\text{Initial value}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{73}{128}\right) \times 100
   \]

4. **Perform the Division and Multiplication**:
   \[
   \frac{73}{128} \approx 0.5703
   \]
   \[
   0.5703 \times 100 \approx 57.03\%
   \]

**Answer**: The percent change in earnings for non-utility nuclear from 2001 to 2002 is approximately 57.03%.

**Source**: Text context provided the earnings figures for 2001 and 2002, which were used in the calculation.

Answer Echoes:
- Earnings for non-utility nuclear in 2001: $128 million
- Earnings for non-utility nuclear in 2002: $201 million
- Initial value (2001 earnings): $128 million
- Final value (2002 earnings): $201 million
