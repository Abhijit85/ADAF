=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the average operating profit of the space results from 2010 to 2012?

**Calculation**:
1. **Extract Operating Profit Data**:
   - 2010: $1030
   - 2011: $1063
   - 2012: $1083

2. **Calculate the Total Operating Profit**:
   \[ 1030 + 1063 + 1083 = 3176 \]

3. **Calculate the Average Operating Profit**:
   \[ \text{Average Operating Profit} = \frac{3176}{3} = 1058.67 \]

**Answer**: $1058.67

**Source**: Table data (as the specific segment data was not available, the overall company data was used).

Answer Echoes:
- 2010: $1,030
- 2011: $1,063
- 2012: $1,083
- The operating profit figures specifically for the space systems segment for each year from 2010 to 2012.
