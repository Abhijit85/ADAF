=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What are the development costs incurred during the period 2007, 2006, and 2005?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Values**:
   - 2007 Development Costs: $1654 million
   - 2006 Development Costs: $1251 million
   - 2005 Development Costs: $1030 million

2. **Total Development Costs Over Three Years**:
   \[
   \text{Total} = 1654 + 1251 + 1030 = 3935 \text{ million}
   \]

3. **Average Development Costs Per Year**:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{3935}{3} = 1311.67 \text{ million}
   \]

4. **Year-over-Year Growth Rates**:
   - **From 2005 to 2006**:
     \[
     \text{Growth Rate (2005 to 2006)} = \frac{1251 - 1030}{1030} \times 100 = 21.46\%
     \]
   - **From 2006 to 2007**:
     \[
     \text{Growth Rate (2006 to 2007)} = \frac{1654 - 1251}{1251} \times 100 = 32.23\%
     \]

**Answer**:
- **Total Development Costs Over Three Years**: $3935 million
- **Average Development Costs Per Year**: $1311.67 million
- **Growth Rate from 2005 to 2006**: 21.46%
- **Growth Rate from 2006 to 2007**: 32.23%

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- 2007 Development Costs: $1,654 million
- 2006 Development Costs: $1,251 million
- 2005 Development Costs: $1,030 million
- The question seems to be asking for a comparison or analysis of the development costs over the three years. This could involve calculating the total, average, or growth rate over the years.
