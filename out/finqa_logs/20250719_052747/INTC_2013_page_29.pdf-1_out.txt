=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What percentage of major facilities by square footage are owned as of December 28, 2013?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base**: The total square footage of major facilities is 54.9 million square feet.
2. **Identify Part**: The square footage of owned facilities is 46.6 million square feet.
3. **Calculate Percentage**: Use the formula \((\text{Part} / \text{Base}) \times 100\).
   \[
   \text{Percentage of Owned Facilities} = \left(\frac{46.6}{54.9}\right) \times 100
   \]
4. **Perform Calculation**:
   \[
   \frac{46.6}{54.9} \approx 0.8488
   \]
   \[
   0.8488 \times 100 \approx 84.88
   \]

**Answer**: 84.88%

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data.

Answer Echoes:
- From the table, the total square footage of all facilities is 54.9 million square feet.
- From the table, the square footage of owned facilities is 46.6 million square feet.
- **Total Square Footage of Major Facilities**: 54.9 million square feet
- **Square Footage of Owned Facilities**: 46.6 million square feet
