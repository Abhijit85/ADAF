=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the percentage of allowance of the company's purchased distressed loan portfolio at December 31, 2010?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base**: The carrying amount of loan receivable at December 31, 2010, is $469 million.
2. **Identify Part**: The allowance at December 31, 2010, is $77 million.
3. **Calculate Percentage**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Allowance}}{\text{Carrying amount of loan receivable}}\right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{77}{469}\right) \times 100 = 16.42\%
   \]

**Answer**: 16.42%

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data (for numerical values) and text context (for understanding terms and ensuring accuracy).

Answer Echoes:
- **Arithmetic Type**: Percentage calculation
- **Data Requirements**: Carrying amount of loan receivable and allowance
- **Context Needs**: Understanding of the terms "carrying amount" and "allowance"
- **Calculation Steps**: Calculate the percentage of allowance relative to the carrying amount
- **Carrying Amount of Loan Receivable**: $469 million
- **Allowance**: $77 million
- The text provides additional context about the nature of the loans and the allowance but does not alter the numerical values needed for the calculation.
- **Formula**:
- Carrying amount of loan receivable: $469 million
- Allowance: $77 million
- \((77 / 469) \times 100 = 16.42\%\)
