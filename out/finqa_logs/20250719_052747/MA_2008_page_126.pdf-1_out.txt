=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the percentage change in total liabilities for litigation settlements from 2006 to 2007?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Relevant Values**:
   - Balance as of December 31, 2006: $476915
   - Balance as of December 31, 2007: $404436

2. **Calculate the Change in Liabilities**:
   - Change in Liabilities = Balance as of December 31, 2007 - Balance as of December 31, 2006
   - Change in Liabilities = $404436 - $476915 = -$72479

3. **Calculate the Percentage Change**:
   - Percentage Change = (Change in Liabilities / Balance as of December 31, 2006) × 100
   - Percentage Change = (-$72479 / $476915) × 100

4. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - Percentage Change = -0.1519 × 100 = -15.19%

**Answer**: -15.19% (decrease)

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- **Balance as of December 31, 2006**: $476,915
- **Balance as of December 31, 2007**: $404,436
- **Change in Liabilities** = Balance as of December 31, 2007 - Balance as of December 31, 2006
- **Change in Liabilities** = $404,436 - $476,915 = -$72,479
- **Percentage Change** = (Change in Liabilities / Balance as of December 31, 2006) × 100
- **Percentage Change** = (-$72,479 / $476,915) × 100
- **Percentage Change** = -0.1519 × 100 = -15.19%
- The percentage change in total liabilities for litigation settlements from 2006 to 2007 is a decrease of 15.19%.
- **Balance as of December 31, 2006**: $476,915
- **Balance as of December 31, 2007**: $404,436
- **Change in Liabilities** = Balance as of December 31, 2007 - Balance as of December 31, 2006
- **Change in Liabilities** = $404,436 - $476,915 = -$72,479
- **Percentage Change** = (Change in Liabilities / Balance as of December 31, 2006) × 100
- **Percentage Change** = (-$72,479 / $476,915) × 100
- **Percentage Change** = -0.1519 × 100 = -15.19%
