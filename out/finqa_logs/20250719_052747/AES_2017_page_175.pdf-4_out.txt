=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What percentage of the company's receivable balances in Puerto Rico as of December 31, 2017, was past due?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Total Receivable Balances**: $86 million
2. **Identify the Overdue Receivable Balances**: $53 million
3. **Calculate the Percentage of Receivables that were Overdue**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Overdue} = \left( \frac{\text{Overdue Receivables}}{\text{Total Receivables}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage Overdue} = \left( \frac{53}{86} \right) \times 100
   \]
4. **Perform the Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Overdue} = 0.6163 \times 100 = 61.63\%
   \]

**Answer**: The percentage of the company's receivable balances in Puerto Rico that were past due as of December 31, 2017, was **61.63%**.
