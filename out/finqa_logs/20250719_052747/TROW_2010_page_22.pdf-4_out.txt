=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What percentage of tangible book value at December 31, 2010, is due to cash and cash equivalents and mutual fund investment holdings?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the relevant values**:
   - Tangible book value at December 31, 2010: $2.6 billion
   - Combined value of cash and cash equivalents and mutual fund investment holdings: $1.5 billion

2. **Calculate the percentage**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Cash and cash equivalents and mutual fund investment holdings}}{\text{Tangible book value}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1.5 \text{ billion}}{2.6 \text{ billion}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1.5}{2.6} \right) \times 100 \approx 57.69\%
   \]

**Answer**: Approximately 57.69% of the tangible book value at December 31, 2010, is due to cash and cash equivalents and mutual fund investment holdings.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Tangible book value at December 31, 2010: $2.6 billion
- Combined value of cash and cash equivalents and mutual fund investment holdings: More than $1.5 billion
- Tangible book value = $2.6 billion
- Cash and cash equivalents and mutual fund investment holdings = $1.5 billion
- Tangible book value = $2.6 billion
- Cash and cash equivalents and mutual fund investment holdings = $1.5 billion
- \(\left( \frac{1.5}{2.6} \right) \times 100 \approx 57.69\%\)
