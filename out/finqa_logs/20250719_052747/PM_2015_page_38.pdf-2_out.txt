=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the percentage change in the weighted-average discount rate for non-U.S. pension plans from 2014 to 2015?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Values**:
   - Discount rate for non-U.S. pension plans in 2014: 1.92%
   - Discount rate for non-U.S. pension plans in 2015: 1.68%

2. **Calculate the Change**:
   - Change = 2015 rate - 2014 rate
   - Change = 1.68% - 1.92% = -0.24%

3. **Calculate the Percentage Change**:
   - Percentage Change = (Change / 2014 rate) × 100
   - Percentage Change = (-0.24% / 1.92%) × 100

4. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - Percentage Change = (-0.24 / 1.92) × 100
   - Percentage Change = -12.5%

**Answer**: The percentage change in the weighted-average discount rate for non-U.S. pension plans from 2014 to 2015 is -12.5%.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Discount rate for non-U.S. pension plans in 2014: 1.92%
- Discount rate for non-U.S. pension plans in 2015: 1.68%
- Change = 2015 rate - 2014 rate
- Change = 1.68% - 1.92% = -0.24%
- Percentage Change = (Change / 2014 rate) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-0.24% / 1.92%) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-0.24 / 1.92) × 100
- Percentage Change = -12.5%
- 2014 Discount Rate: 1.92%
- 2015 Discount Rate: 1.68%
- Change = 2015 rate - 2014 rate
- Change = 1.68% - 1.92% = -0.24%
- Percentage Change = (Change / 2014 rate) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-0.24% / 1.92%) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-0.24 / 1.92) × 100
- Percentage Change = -12.5%
