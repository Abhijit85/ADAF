=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: For 2013, what was the total in millions of the combined interest-only product and principal and interest product?

**Calculation**:
1. Identify the values from the table:
   - Interest Only Product for 2013: $1211 million
   - Principal and Interest Product for 2013: $331 million

2. Perform the calculation by adding these two values:
   \[
   \text{Total for 2013} = \text{Interest Only Product} + \text{Principal and Interest Product}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total for 2013} = 1211 + 331
   \]

3. Calculate the sum:
   \[
   \text{Total for 2013} = 1542
   \]

**Answer**: The total in millions of the combined interest-only product and principal and interest product for 2013 is $1542 million.

**Source**: Table data was used to extract the numerical values for the calculation.

Answer Echoes:
- Interest Only Product for 2013: $1,211 million
- Principal and Interest Product for 2013: $331 million
- **Interest Only Product for 2013**: $1,211 million
- **Principal and Interest Product for 2013**: $331 million
- Interest Only Product for 2013: $1,211 million
- Principal and Interest Product for 2013: $331 million
- We need to find the total of these two products for 2013 by adding them together.
