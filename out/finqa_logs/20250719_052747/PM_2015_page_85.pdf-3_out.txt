=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the interest expense in 2015 assuming that all the debt is interest-bearing debt, (in billions)?

**Calculation**:
1. **Interest from U.S. Dollar Notes**:
   - **Note 1 (1.250%)**:
     - Face Value: $500 million
     - Annual Interest: $500 million × 1.250% = $6.25 million
     - Interest for 5 months in 2015: ($6.25 million / 12) × 5 = $2.604 million

   - **Note 2 (3.375%)**:
     - Face Value: $750 million
     - Annual Interest: $750 million × 3.375% = $25.3125 million
     - Interest for 5 months in 2015: ($25.3125 million / 12) × 5 = $10.547 million

   - **Total Interest from Notes**: $2.604 million + $10.547 million = $13.151 million
   - Convert to billions: $13.151 million = $0.013151 billion

2. **Interest on Total Debt**:
   - Total Debt at December 31, 2015: $28.5 billion
   - Weighted-Average All-In Financing Cost: 3.0%
   - Annual Interest Expense on Total Debt: $28.5 billion × 3.0% = $0.855 billion

3. **Total Interest Expense for 2015**:
   - Total Interest Expense = Interest from Notes + Interest on Total Debt
   - Total Interest Expense = $0.013151 billion + $0.855 billion = $0.868151 billion

**Answer**: $0.868 billion

Answer Echoes:
- **U.S. dollar notes (1.250%)**:
- Face Value: $500 million
- Interest Rate: 1.250%
- Issuance: August 2015
- Maturity: August 2017
- **U.S. dollar notes (3.375%)**:
- Face Value: $750 million
- Interest Rate: 3.375%
- Issuance: August 2015
- Maturity: August 2025
- **Annual Interest**: $500 million × 1.250% = $6.25 million
- **Interest for 2015**: Since the notes were issued in August, they were outstanding for 5 months in 2015.
- Monthly Interest: $6.25 million / 12 months = $0.5208 million per month
- Interest for 5 months: $0.5208 million/month × 5 months = $2.604 million
- **Annual Interest**: $750 million × 3.375% = $25.3125 million
- **Interest for 2015**: Similarly, these notes were also outstanding for 5 months in 2015.
- Monthly Interest: $25.3125 million / 12 months = $2.1094 million per month
- Interest for 5 months: $2.1094 million/month × 5 months = $10.547 million
- Total Interest Expense = Interest from Note 1 + Interest from Note 2
- Total Interest Expense = $2.604 million + $10.547 million = $13.151 million
- $13.151 million = $0.013151 billion
- Note 1: ($500 million × 1.250% × 5/12) + Note 2: ($750 million × 3.375% × 5/12)
- Total Interest Expense = $13.151 million = $0.013151 billion
- **U.S. Dollar Notes (1.250%)**:
- Face Value: $500 million
- Interest Rate: 1.250%
- Interest for 2015: $2.604 million
- **U.S. Dollar Notes (3.375%)**:
- Face Value: $750 million
- Interest Rate: 3.375%
- Interest for 2015: $10.547 million
- **Total Interest Expense from Notes**: $13.151 million
- **Total Debt at December 31, 2015**: $28.5 billion
- **Weighted-Average All-In Financing Cost of Total Debt in 2015**: 3.0%
- Total Debt: $28.5 billion
- Interest Rate: 3.0%
- Annual Interest Expense on Total Debt = $28.5 billion × 3.0% = $0.855 billion
- Interest from U.S. Dollar Notes: $0.013151 billion (from table data)
- Interest on Total Debt: $0.855 billion
- Total Interest Expense = $0.013151 billion + $0.855 billion = $0.868151 billion
- Interest from U.S. dollar notes: $0.013151 billion
- Interest on total debt: $0.855 billion
- Total Interest Expense = Interest from Notes + Interest on Total Debt
- Total Interest Expense = $0.013151 billion + $0.855 billion = $0.868151 billion
