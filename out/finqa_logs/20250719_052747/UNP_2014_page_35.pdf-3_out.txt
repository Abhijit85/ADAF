=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the percentage change in cash provided by operating activities from 2012 to 2013?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base and Part**:
   - Base (2012): Cash provided by operating activities in 2012 = $6161 million
   - Part (2013): Cash provided by operating activities in 2013 = $6823 million

2. **Calculate the Change**:
   - Change = Part (2013) - Base (2012) = $6823 million - $6161 million = $662 million

3. **Calculate the Percentage Change**:
   - Percentage Change = \((\text{Change} / \text{Base}) \times 100 = (662 / 6161) \times 100\)

4. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - \((662 / 6161) \times 100 \approx 10.74\%\)

**Answer**: The percentage change in cash provided by operating activities from 2012 to 2013 is approximately 10.74%.

**Source**: Table data was used for the exact numerical values, and the calculation was verified for mathematical accuracy. The text context was reviewed but did not directly impact the calculation.

Answer Echoes:
- **Base (2012)**: Cash provided by operating activities in 2012 = $6,161 million
- **Part (2013)**: Cash provided by operating activities in 2013 = $6,823 million
- **Change**: $6,823 million (2013) - $6,161 million (2012) = $662 million
- **Percentage Change**: \((\text{Change} / \text{Base}) \times 100 = (662 / 6,161) \times 100\)
- \((662 / 6,161) \times 100 \approx 10.74\%\)
- **Answer**: 10.74%
- **Base (2012)**: Cash provided by operating activities in 2012 = $6,161 million
- **Part (2013)**: Cash provided by operating activities in 2013 = $6,823 million
- The text context provides additional information about factors influencing cash flows, such as higher net income and tax payments, but does not directly affect the calculation of percentage change.
- Base (2012): $6,161 million
- Part (2013): $6,823 million
- Change = Part (2013) - Base (2012) = $6,823 million - $6,161 million = $662 million
- Percentage Change = \((\text{Change} / \text{Base}) \times 100 = (662 / 6,161) \times 100\)
- \((662 / 6,161) \times 100 \approx 10.74\%\)
