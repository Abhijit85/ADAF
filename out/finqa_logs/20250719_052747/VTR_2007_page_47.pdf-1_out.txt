=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Prior to the shares repurchased in 2007, how many shares of common stock were outstanding?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Total Shares Outstanding After Repurchase**:
   - From the text, as of February 15, 2008, there were 138311810 shares of common stock outstanding. This figure is after the repurchase in December 2007.

2. **Determine the Number of Shares Repurchased**:
   - From the table, the number of shares repurchased in December 2007 is 14669 shares.

3. **Calculate the Shares Outstanding Prior to Repurchase**:
   - To find the number of shares outstanding before the repurchase, add the number of shares repurchased to the total shares outstanding after the repurchase.
   \[
   \text{Shares Outstanding Before Repurchase} = \text{Shares Outstanding After Repurchase} + \text{Shares Repurchased}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Shares Outstanding Before Repurchase} = 138311810 + 14669 = 138326479
   \]

**Answer**: Prior to the shares repurchased in 2007, there were 138326479 shares of common stock outstanding.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
