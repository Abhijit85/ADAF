=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the fair value of Hologic common stock used to acquire Suros?

**Calculation**:
1. From the text context, the initial aggregate purchase price for Suros was approximately $248100, which includes:
   - 2300 shares of Hologic common stock valued at $106500
   - Cash paid of $139000
   - Approximately $2600 for acquisition-related fees and expenses

2. The table provides a breakdown of the estimated purchase price of $267100, which includes various components such as net tangible assets, in-process research and development, developed technology and know-how, customer relationships, trade name, deferred income taxes, and goodwill.

3. The discrepancy between the table's estimated purchase price ($267100) and the text's aggregate purchase price ($248100) could be due to adjustments or additional considerations not detailed in the text.

4. The fair value of the Hologic common stock used in the acquisition is explicitly stated in the text as $106500.

**Answer**: The fair value of Hologic common stock used to acquire Suros is $106500.

**Source**: Text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Net tangible assets: $11,800
- In-process research and development: $4,900
- Developed technology and know-how: $46,000
- Customer relationship: $17,900
- Trade name: $5,800
- Deferred income taxes: $(21,300)
- Goodwill: $202,000
- **Net tangible assets**: $11,800
- **In-process research and development**: $4,900
- **Developed technology and know-how**: $46,000
- **Customer relationship**: $17,900
- **Trade name**: $5,800
- **Deferred income taxes**: $(21,300)
- **Goodwill**: $202,000
- The text states that the initial aggregate purchase price for Suros was approximately $248,100, consisting of:
- 2,300 shares of Hologic common stock valued at $106,500
- Cash paid of $139,000
- Approximately $2,600 for acquisition-related fees and expenses
- From the text, the components contributing to the purchase price are the value of the common stock, cash, and acquisition-related fees.
- The text explicitly states that the 2,300 shares of Hologic common stock were valued at $106,500.
- The total purchase price from the text ($248,100) is slightly different from the table's estimated purchase price ($267,100). This discrepancy could be due to adjustments or additional considerations not detailed in the text.
