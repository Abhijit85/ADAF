=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the ratio of Snap-on's performance to that of the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index in 2012?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Required Data**: We need the performance values for Snap-on and the S&P 500 for the year 2012.
2. **Extract from Table**: The values extracted are 187.26 for Snap-on and 108.59 for the S&P 500.
3. **Perform Calculations**: Calculate the ratio of Snap-on's performance to the S&P 500's performance:

   \[
   \text{Ratio} = \frac{187.26}{108.59}
   \]

4. **Execute Arithmetic Operations**: Perform the division:

   \[
   \text{Ratio} = 1.724
   \]

5. **Validate Results**: Check for reasonableness. The calculation appears correct based on the extracted data.

**Answer**: The ratio of Snap-on's performance to the S&P 500's performance in 2012 is approximately 1.724.

**Source**: Table data was used for the exact numerical values.

Answer Echoes:
- We need to compare Snap-on's performance in 2012 to the S&P 500's performance in 2012.
- From the table, the performance values for 2012 are:
- Snap-on Incorporated: 187.26
- S&P 500: 108.59
- The ratio is calculated as Snap-on's performance divided by the S&P 500's performance:
- Performing the division:
- The ratio of Snap-on's performance to the S&P 500's performance in 2012 is approximately 1.724.
- From the table, the performance values for 2012 are:
- Snap-on Incorporated: 187.26
- S&P 500: 108.59
