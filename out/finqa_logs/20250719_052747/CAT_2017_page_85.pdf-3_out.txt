=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What portion of the maximum exposure to loss from VIEs is related to guarantees in 2018?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Relevant Data**:
   - Guarantees in 2017: $259 million
   - Total Maximum Exposure in 2017: $412 million

2. **Calculate the Portion Related to Guarantees in 2017**:
   \[
   \text{Portion} = \frac{\text{Guarantees in 2017}}{\text{Total in 2017}} = \frac{259}{412} \approx 0.6291
   \]

3. **Convert to Percentage**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = 0.6291 \times 100 \approx 62.91\%
   \]

4. **Estimate for 2018**:
   - Since specific 2018 data is not available, we assume the trend from 2017 continues. Therefore, the portion of guarantees in 2018 is estimated to be approximately 62.91% of the total maximum exposure to loss from VIEs.

**Answer**: Approximately 62.91% of the maximum exposure to loss from VIEs is estimated to be related to guarantees in 2018, based on the trend from 2017.

**Source**: Combined analysis using table data from 2017 as a proxy due to the lack of specific 2018 data.

Answer Echoes:
- Guarantees in 2017: $259 million
- Guarantees in 2016: $210 million
- Total in 2017: $412 million
- Total in 2016: $716 million
- Portion related to guarantees in 2017 = Guarantees / Total
- Portion related to guarantees in 2017 = $259 million / $412 million
- **Arithmetic Type**: Ratio and percentage
- **Data Requirements**: Maximum exposure to loss from VIEs and guarantees for 2018
- **Context Needs**: Trends from previous years to estimate 2018 values
- **2017 Guarantees**: $259 million
- **2017 Total Maximum Exposure**: $412 million
- **2016 Guarantees**: $210 million
- **2016 Total Maximum Exposure**: $716 million
- The text does not provide specific 2018 data, but it does mention trends and how the financial products segment operates.
- **Portion related to guarantees in 2017**:
- **Convert to Percentage**:
- Since specific 2018 data is not available, we assume the trend from 2017 continues.
- The portion of guarantees in 2017 was approximately 62.91% of the total maximum exposure to loss from VIEs.
- Without additional data, we use this percentage as an estimate for 2018.
