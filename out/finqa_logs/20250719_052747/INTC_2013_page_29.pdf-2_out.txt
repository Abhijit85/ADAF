=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What percentage of major facilities by square footage are leased as of December 28, 2013?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Base**: Total square footage of all major facilities is 54.9 million square feet.
2. **Identify the Part**: Square footage of leased facilities is 8.3 million square feet.
3. **Calculate the Percentage**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of Leased Facilities} = \left(\frac{\text{Leased Facilities}}{\text{Total Facilities}}\right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   = \left(\frac{8.3}{54.9}\right) \times 100
   \]
4. **Perform the Calculation**:
   \[
   = 0.151183 \times 100
   \]
   \[
   = 15.12\%
   \]

**Answer**: 15.12% of major facilities by square footage are leased as of December 28, 2013.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data.

Answer Echoes:
- From the table, the total facilities square footage is 54.9 million square feet.
- From the table, the total leased facilities square footage is 8.3 million square feet.
- **Total Facilities Square Footage**: 54.9 million square feet
- **Leased Facilities Square Footage**: 8.3 million square feet
- Total facilities square footage: 54.9 million square feet
- Leased facilities square footage: 8.3 million square feet
- \((8.3 / 54.9) \times 100 = 15.12\%\)
