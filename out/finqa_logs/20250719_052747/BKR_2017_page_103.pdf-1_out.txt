=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the expense which relates to the acceleration of equity awards upon termination of employment of Baker Hughes employees as a percentage of stock-based compensation expense?

**Calculation**:
1. **Total Stock-Based Compensation Expense**: $37 million
2. **Expense Related to Acceleration of Equity Awards**: $15 million

To find the percentage of the total stock-based compensation expense that is related to the acceleration of equity awards, use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Expense related to acceleration}}{\text{Total stock-based compensation expense}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substitute the extracted values:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15 \text{ million}}{37 \text{ million}} \right) \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{37} \right) \times 100 \approx 40.54\%
\]

**Answer**: The expense related to the acceleration of equity awards upon termination of employment of Baker Hughes employees is approximately 40.54% of the total stock-based compensation expense.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context.
