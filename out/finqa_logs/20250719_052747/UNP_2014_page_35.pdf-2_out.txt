=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the cost per car for the buyout of locomotives in 2012?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Total Cost and Number of Locomotives**:
   - Total cost for buyout in 2012 = $75 million
   - Number of locomotives = 165

2. **Calculate the Cost per Locomotive**:
   - Cost per locomotive = Total cost / Number of locomotives
   - Cost per locomotive = $75000000 / 165

3. **Perform the Division**:
   - Cost per locomotive = $454545.45 (rounded to two decimal places)

**Answer**: The cost per car for the buyout of locomotives in 2012 was approximately $454545.45.

**Source**: Text Context (as the table did not provide relevant data)

Answer Echoes:
- The text states that in 2012, $75 million was spent for the early buyout of 165 locomotives under long-term operating and capital leases.
- Total cost for buyout in 2012 = $75 million
- Number of locomotives = 165
- Cost per locomotive = Total cost / Number of locomotives
- Cost per locomotive = $75,000,000 / 165
- Cost per locomotive = $454,545.45 (rounded to two decimal places)
- Total cost for buyout in 2012 = $75 million
- Number of locomotives = 165
- Cost per locomotive = $75,000,000 / 165 = $454,545.45
