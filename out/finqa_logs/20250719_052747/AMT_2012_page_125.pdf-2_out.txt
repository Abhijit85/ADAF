=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: For the MTN deal, what was the total post-closing adjustments, in millions?

**Calculation**:
1. **Extract Data from Text Context**:
   - Initial aggregate purchase price: $171.5 million
   - Adjusted aggregate purchase price: $173.2 million

2. **Determine Post-Closing Adjustments**:
   - Post-closing adjustments = Adjusted aggregate purchase price - Initial aggregate purchase price
   - Post-closing adjustments = $173.2 million - $171.5 million

3. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - Post-closing adjustments = $1.7 million

**Answer**: The total post-closing adjustments for the MTN deal were $1.7 million.

**Source**: Combined analysis using both table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- We have the "Fair value of net assets acquired" and "Goodwill" listed in the table.
- The total purchase price is typically the sum of the fair value of net assets acquired and goodwill.
- Fair value of net assets acquired: $160,596
- Goodwill: $12,564
- Total Purchase Price = Fair value of net assets acquired + Goodwill
- Total Purchase Price = $160,596 + $12,564
- Total Purchase Price = $173,160
- The question asks for total post-closing adjustments. However, the table does not explicitly list any post-closing adjustments. If we assume that the total purchase price calculated is the adjusted amount, then the post-closing adjustments would be the difference between the preliminary purchase price allocation and the total purchase price.
- Since the table does not provide a preliminary purchase price, we assume the total purchase price calculated is the final adjusted amount.
- Total Purchase Price in millions = $173,160 / 1,000 = $173.16 million
- Initial aggregate purchase price: $171.5 million
- Adjusted aggregate purchase price: $173.2 million
- Fair value of net assets acquired: $160,596 (in thousands)
- Goodwill: $12,564 (in thousands)
- Total purchase price calculated from table: $173,160 (in thousands)
- Fair value of net assets acquired: $160,596,000 / 1,000,000 = $160.596 million
- Goodwill: $12,564,000 / 1,000,000 = $12.564 million
- Total purchase price from table: $173,160,000 / 1,000,000 = $173.16 million
- The adjusted aggregate purchase price from the text is $173.2 million.
- The initial aggregate purchase price was $171.5 million.
- Post-closing adjustments = Adjusted aggregate purchase price - Initial aggregate purchase price
- Post-closing adjustments = $173.2 million - $171.5 million
- Post-closing adjustments = $1.7 million
- Initial aggregate purchase price: $171.5 million
- Adjusted aggregate purchase price: $173.2 million
- Post-closing adjustments = $173.2 million - $171.5 million = $1.7 million
