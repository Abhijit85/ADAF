=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: For the three months ended March 2003, what were the total sales proceeds for subsidiaries' assets in millions?

**Calculation**:
1. Identify the relevant projects and their sales proceeds:
   - CILCORP/Medina Valley: Completed in January 2003, Sales Proceeds = $495 million
   - AES Ecogen/AES Mt. Stuart: Completed in January 2003, Sales Proceeds = $59 million
   - Mountainview: Completed in March 2003, Sales Proceeds = $30 million
   - Kelvin: Completed in March 2003, Sales Proceeds = $29 million

2. Sum the sales proceeds for these projects:
   - Total Sales Proceeds = $495 million + $59 million + $30 million + $29 million

3. Perform the calculation:
   - Total Sales Proceeds = $495 + $59 + $30 + $29 = $613 million

**Answer**: $613 million

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.
