=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In December 2011, what was the ratio of the receivables to the credit facility outstanding?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Required Data**:
   - **Receivables**: The table does not specify the value of receivables for December 2011.
   - **Credit Facility Outstanding**: From the text context, we know that $50 million was outstanding on the credit facility as of December 31, 2011.

2. **Data Extraction**:
   - The table provides a figure of ($118415) in thousands for 2011, but it does not specify what this figure represents. Without knowing if this is related to receivables, we cannot use it for the calculation.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the table does not provide a clear figure for receivables and the text does not mention it, we cannot calculate the ratio of receivables to the credit facility outstanding.

**Answer**: Additional context is required to determine the receivables amount for December 31, 2011. Without this information, the ratio cannot be calculated.

**Source**: Combined analysis of table and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- **Receivables**: We need the value of receivables as of December 31, 2011.
- **Credit Facility Outstanding**: We need the amount outstanding on the credit facility as of December 31, 2011.
- **Credit Facility Outstanding**: The text states that as of December 31, 2011, $50 million was outstanding on the credit facility.
- The table provides a single financial figure for 2011: ($118,415) in thousands. However, it does not specify whether this figure represents receivables or another financial metric. Given the lack of specification, we cannot directly use this figure to determine the receivables.
