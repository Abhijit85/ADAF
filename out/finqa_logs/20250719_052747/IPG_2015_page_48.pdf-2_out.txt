=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the percentage change in interest income from 2014 to 2015?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Change in Interest Income**:
   - Interest income for 2014: $27.4 million
   - Interest income for 2015: $22.8 million
   - Change in interest income = Interest income in 2015 - Interest income in 2014
   - Change = $22.8 million - $27.4 million = -$4.6 million

2. **Calculate the Percentage Change**:
   - Percentage Change = (Change in Interest Income / Interest Income in 2014) × 100
   - Percentage Change = (-$4.6 million / $27.4 million) × 100
   - Percentage Change = (-0.1678832117) × 100 ≈ -16.79%

**Answer**: The percentage change in interest income from 2014 to 2015 is approximately -16.79%.

**Source**: Combined analysis using text context for interest income figures.

Answer Echoes:
- For a 10% increase in interest rates:
- 2014: $(35.5)
- 2015: $(33.7)
- For a 10% decrease in interest rates:
- 2014: $36.6
- 2015: $34.7
- For a 10% increase in interest rates:
- Change from 2014 to 2015 = $(33.7) - $(35.5) = $1.8
- For a 10% decrease in interest rates:
- Change from 2014 to 2015 = $34.7 - $36.6 = $(1.9)
- We will use the 2014 values as the base for calculating the percentage change.
- For a 10% increase in interest rates:
- Percentage Change = ($1.8 / $(35.5)) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-5.07%)
- For a 10% decrease in interest rates:
- Percentage Change = ($(1.9) / $36.6) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-5.19%)
- Interest income for 2014: $27.4 million
- Interest income for 2015: $22.8 million
- Change in interest income = Interest income in 2015 - Interest income in 2014
- Change = $22.8 million - $27.4 million = -$4.6 million
- Percentage Change = (Change in Interest Income / Interest Income in 2014) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-$4.6 million / $27.4 million) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-0.1678832117) × 100 ≈ -16.79%
