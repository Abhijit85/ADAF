=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What percentage of the board of directors approved budget was capital expenditures?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base**: The total budget approved by the board of directors is $3521 million.
2. **Identify Part**: The capital expenditures portion of the budget is $3442 million, which is the sum of "North America E&P," "International E&P," and "Oil Sands Mining."
3. **Calculate Percentage**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of Capital Expenditures} = \left(\frac{3442}{3521}\right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage of Capital Expenditures} = 0.9776 \times 100 = 97.76\%
   \]

**Answer**: 97.76% of the board of directors approved budget was capital expenditures.
