=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the average payment per year for the state tax settlement, in millions?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Total Payment**:
   - From the table, the initial balance at March 31, 2008, was $168 million.
   - The balance at March 31, 2009, was $0 million.
   - The reduction in balance, which represents the total payment made for the state tax settlement, is $168 million.

2. **Determine Time Period**:
   - The payment was made over a period of one year, from March 31, 2008, to March 31, 2009.

3. **Calculate Average Payment Per Year**:
   \[
   \text{Average Payment Per Year} = \frac{\text{Total Payment}}{\text{Number of Years}} = \frac{168 \text{ million}}{1 \text{ year}} = 168 \text{ million per year}
   \]

**Answer**: $168 million per year

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- **Initial Balance at March 31, 2008**: $168 million
- **Reductions for tax positions for closing of the applicable statute of limitations**: $(168) million
- **Balance at March 31, 2009**: $0 million
- **Initial Balance at March 31, 2008**: $168 million
- **Reductions for tax positions for closing of the applicable statute of limitations**: $(168) million
- **Balance at March 31, 2009**: $0 million
- The company remitted all outstanding amounts owed to each of the states by March 31, 2009.
- The period over which the payment was made is one year (from March 31, 2008, to March 31, 2009).
- The total reduction in the balance from March 31, 2008, to March 31, 2009, is $168 million. This reduction represents the total payment made for the state tax settlement over the period.
- The payment was made over one year.
- Since the total payment was made over one year, the average payment per year is simply the total payment divided by the number of years.
- Total Payment: $168 million
- Time Period: 1 year
- Total Payment = $168 million
- Number of Years = 1
- Average Payment Per Year = $168 million / 1 year = $168 million per year
