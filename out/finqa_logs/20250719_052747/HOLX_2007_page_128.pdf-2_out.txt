=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What portion of the estimated purchase price of R2 is paid in cash?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Cash Portion from Text Context**: 
   - Cash paid: $6900

2. **Verify Total Purchase Price**:
   - Components from text:
     - Hologic common stock: $205500
     - Cash: $6900
     - Debt assumed: $5700
     - Acquisition-related fees and expenses: $2500
   - Total: $205500 (stock) + $6900 (cash) + $5700 (debt) + $2500 (fees) = $220600

3. **Confirm Total Matches Estimated Purchase Price**:
   - The total of $220600 matches the estimated purchase price provided.

**Answer**: The portion of the estimated purchase price of R2 paid in cash is $6900.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context and table data.

Answer Echoes:
- Net tangible assets acquired: $1,200
- In-process research and development: $10,200
- Developed technology and know-how: $39,500
- Customer relationship: $15,700
- Trade name: $3,300
- Order Backlog: $800
- Deferred income taxes: $4,400
- Goodwill: $145,500
- Sum of all components = $1,200 + $10,200 + $39,500 + $15,700 + $3,300 + $800 + $4,400 + $145,500 = $220,600
- Estimated Purchase Price = $220,600
- The total estimated purchase price for R2 Technology, Inc. is $220,600.
- The breakdown of the purchase price includes:
- Hologic common stock valued at $205,500
- Cash paid of $6,900
- Debt assumed of $5,700
- Acquisition-related fees and expenses of $2,500
- The table lists components of the purchase price, but it does not explicitly mention the cash portion. The components sum up to the total estimated purchase price of $220,600, which matches the total provided in the text.
- Stock: $205,500
- Cash: $6,900
- Debt: $5,700
- Fees: $2,500
- Total: $205,500 + $6,900 + $5,700 + $2,500 = $220,600
- Cash portion of the purchase price: $6,900 (from text context)
- Total purchase price components: $205,500 (stock) + $6,900 (cash) + $5,700 (debt) + $2,500 (fees) = $220,600
