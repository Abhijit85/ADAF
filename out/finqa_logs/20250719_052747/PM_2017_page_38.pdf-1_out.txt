=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the change in millions of operating income from 2016 to 2017?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Values**:
   - Operating income for 2017: $11503 million
   - Operating income for 2016: $10815 million

2. **Calculate the Difference**:
   \[
   \text{Change in Operating Income} = \text{Operating Income in 2017} - \text{Operating Income in 2016}
   \]
   \[
   = 11503 - 10815
   \]
   \[
   = 688 \text{ million}
   \]

3. **Check Sign**: The result is positive, indicating an increase.

**Answer**: The change in operating income from 2016 to 2017 was an increase of $688 million.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Operating income for 2017: $11,503 million
- Operating income for 2016: $10,815 million
- Operating income for 2017: $11,503 million
- Operating income for 2016: $10,815 million
- The text confirms the increase in operating income is due to various factors, including price increases and offsetting costs.
- Operating income for 2017: $11,503 million
- Operating income for 2016: $10,815 million
- Operating income for 2017: $11,503 million
- Operating income for 2016: $10,815 million
- \(11,503 - 10,815 = 688\)
