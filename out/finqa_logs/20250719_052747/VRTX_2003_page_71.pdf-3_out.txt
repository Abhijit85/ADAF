=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the percentage change in the common stock and option?

**Calculation**: 
To calculate the percentage change, we need both the current and previous values of the common stock and option. The formula for percentage change is:

\[ \text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{\text{Current Value} - \text{Previous Value}}{\text{Previous Value}} \right) \times 100 \]

**Answer**: 
Since the provided data only includes the current values of common stock under stock and option plans (21829), the Vertex Purchase Plan (249), and the Vertex 401(k) Plan (125), totaling 22203, and does not include any previous period data, it is impossible to calculate the percentage change. Additional historical data is required to perform this calculation.

**Source**: Table data provided, but lacking previous period data for comparison.

Answer Echoes:
- Common stock under stock and option plans: 21,829
- Common stock under the Vertex Purchase Plan: 249
- Common stock under the Vertex 401(k) Plan: 125
- Total: 22,203
- A previous value for "Common stock under stock and option plans" to compare against the current value of 21,829.
- **Arithmetic Type**: Percentage change
- **Data Requirements**: Current and previous values of common stock and option
- **Context Needs**: Previous period data for common stock and option
- **Current Values**:
- Common stock under stock and option plans: 21,829
- Common stock under the Vertex Purchase Plan: 249
- Common stock under the Vertex 401(k) Plan: 125
- Total: 22,203
- The text does not provide previous period data for common stock and option plans.
- **Change Percentages**: Requires both current and previous values to calculate the percentage change.
