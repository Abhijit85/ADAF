=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the percent of the total commitment with an expiration of less than 1 year that was subject to renewal?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Total Commitments with Expiration Less Than 1 Year**:
   - From the table: $2505 million.

2. **Identify Total Amount Subject to Renewal**:
   - From the text context:
     - Standby letters of credit subject to renewal = $2262 million.
     - Surety bonds subject to renewal = $38 million.
   - Total amount subject to renewal = $2262 million + $38 million = $2300 million.

3. **Calculate the Percentage**:
   - Percentage of total commitment subject to renewal = (Total amount subject to renewal / Total commitments with an expiration of less than 1 year) × 100
   - = ($2300 million / $2505 million) × 100
   - = 91.76%

**Answer**: 91.76% of the total commitment with an expiration of less than 1 year was subject to renewal.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- **Base**: Total commitments with an expiration of less than 1 year.
- **Part**: The portion of the total commitment that is subject to renewal. However, the table does not provide explicit information about what portion of the commitments is subject to renewal. Without this specific data, we cannot calculate the percentage of commitments subject to renewal.
- Total commitments with an expiration of less than 1 year = $2,505 million.
- Total commitments with an expiration of less than 1 year = $2,505 million.
- Approximately $2,262 million of standby letters of credit in the "less than 1 year" period are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation.
- Additionally, approximately $38 million of surety bonds in the "less than 1 year" period are expected to renew.
- Standby letters of credit subject to renewal = $2,262 million.
- Surety bonds subject to renewal = $38 million.
- Total amount subject to renewal = $2,262 million + $38 million = $2,300 million.
- Percentage of total commitment subject to renewal = (Total amount subject to renewal / Total commitments with an expiration of less than 1 year) × 100
- = ($2,300 million / $2,505 million) × 100
- = 91.76%
- Total commitments with an expiration of less than 1 year = $2,505 million.
- Total amount subject to renewal = $2,300 million.
- Percentage = ($2,300 million / $2,505 million) × 100 = 91.76%
