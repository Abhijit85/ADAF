=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the percentage change in cash provided by operating activities from 2013 to 2014?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base**: Cash provided by operating activities in 2013 = $6823 million.
2. **Identify Part**: Cash provided by operating activities in 2014 = $7385 million.
3. **Calculate the Change**: 
   - Change = Cash in 2014 - Cash in 2013
   - Change = $7385 million - $6823 million = $562 million
4. **Calculate the Percentage Change**:
   - Percentage Change = (Change / Base) × 100
   - Percentage Change = ($562 million / $6823 million) × 100
   - Percentage Change = 0.0824 × 100 = 8.24%

**Answer**: The percentage change in cash provided by operating activities from 2013 to 2014 is 8.24%.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Change = Cash in 2014 - Cash in 2013
- Change = $7,385 million - $6,823 million = $562 million
- Percentage Change = (Change / Base) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($562 million / $6,823 million) × 100
- Percentage Change = 0.0824 × 100 = 8.24%
- Cash provided by operating activities in 2013: $6,823 million
- Cash provided by operating activities in 2014: $7,385 million
- The context explains factors influencing cash flow changes, such as higher net income and tax payments, but these do not directly affect the calculation of percentage change.
- Change = Cash in 2014 - Cash in 2013
- Change = $7,385 million - $6,823 million = $562 million
- Percentage Change = (Change / Base) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($562 million / $6,823 million) × 100
- Percentage Change = 0.0824 × 100 = 8.24%
- Cash in 2013: $6,823 million
- Cash in 2014: $7,385 million
- Change = $562 million
- Percentage Change = 8.24%
