=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the net change in the number of environmental sites from 2011 to 2012?

**Calculation**:
1. Identify the ending balance of open sites for each year:
   - Ending balance at December 31, 2011: 285 sites
   - Ending balance at December 31, 2012: 284 sites

2. Calculate the net change:
   - Net Change = Ending balance 2012 - Ending balance 2011
   - Net Change = 284 - 285
   - Net Change = -1

**Answer**: The net change in the number of environmental sites from 2011 to 2012 was -1.

**Source**: Table data was used to extract the ending balances for 2011 and 2012, ensuring the calculation is based on reliable numerical data.

Answer Echoes:
- Open sites, ending balance at December 31, 2011: 285
- Open sites, ending balance at December 31, 2012: 284
- Net Change = Ending balance 2012 - Ending balance 2011
- Net Change = 284 - 285
- Net Change = -1
- **Arithmetic Type**: Difference
- **Data Requirements**: Ending balance of open sites for 2011 and 2012
- **Context Needs**: Understanding of environmental site activity and liabilities
- **Calculation Steps**: Determine the net change in the number of sites
- **Additional Context**: The environmental liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites, as well as ongoing monitoring costs.
- **Net Change**: Calculate the difference between the ending balances for 2012 and 2011.
- 2011: 285 sites
- 2012: 284 sites
- Net Change = Ending balance 2012 - Ending balance 2011
- Net Change = 284 - 285
- Net Change = -1
- Ending balance of open sites at December 31, 2011: 285
- Ending balance of open sites at December 31, 2012: 284
- Net Change = 284 - 285 = -1
