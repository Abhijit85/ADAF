=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In 2006, what percentage of consumer packaging sales were represented by foodservice net sales?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Base and Part**:
   - **Base (Consumer Packaging Sales)**: $2455 million (from table)
   - **Part (Foodservice Net Sales)**: $396 million (from text)

2. **Calculate the Percentage**:
   - Formula: \((\text{Part} / \text{Base}) \times 100\)
   - Calculation: \((396 / 2455) \times 100 = 16.13\%\)

**Answer**: In 2006, foodservice net sales represented 16.13% of consumer packaging sales.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- **Base (Consumer Packaging Sales)**: This is the total sales figure for 2006, which is $2,455 million.
- **Part (Foodservice Net Sales)**: The question asks for the percentage of consumer packaging sales represented by foodservice net sales. However, the table provided does not contain specific data on foodservice net sales.
- **Consumer Packaging Sales in 2006**: The text states that consumer packaging net sales increased by 9% compared to 2005. However, the exact figure for 2006 is not directly mentioned in the context.
- **Foodservice Net Sales in 2006**: The text provides this figure as $396 million.
- **Consumer Packaging Sales in 2006**: The table data mentions that the total consumer packaging sales for 2006 were $2,455 million.
- **Base (Consumer Packaging Sales)**: $2,455 million
- **Part (Foodservice Net Sales)**: $396 million
- Formula: \((\text{Part} / \text{Base}) \times 100\)
- Calculation: \((396 / 2,455) \times 100\)
- \((396 / 2,455) \times 100 = 16.13\%\)
- Consumer Packaging Sales in 2006: $2,455 million (from table)
- Foodservice Net Sales in 2006: $396 million (from text)
- \((396 / 2,455) \times 100 = 16.13\%\)
