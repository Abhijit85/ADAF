=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the percentage change in the unrecognized tax benefits from 2014 to 2015?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base**: The base value is the unrecognized tax benefits at the end of 2014, which is $394 million.
2. **Identify Part**: The part value is the unrecognized tax benefits at the end of 2015, which is $373 million.
3. **Calculate the Change**: 
   - Change = Balance at December 31, 2015 - Balance at December 31, 2014
   - Change = $373 million - $394 million = -$21 million
4. **Calculate the Percentage Change**:
   - Percentage Change = (Change / Base) × 100
   - Percentage Change = (-$21 million / $394 million) × 100
   - Percentage Change = -0.0533 × 100 = -5.33%

**Answer**: The percentage change in the unrecognized tax benefits from 2014 to 2015 was \(-5.33\%\).

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- From the table: Balance at December 31, 2014 = $394
- From the table: Balance at December 31, 2015 = $373
- Change = Balance at December 31, 2015 - Balance at December 31, 2014
- Change = $373 - $394 = -$21
- Percentage Change = (Change / Base) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-$21 / $394) × 100
- Percentage Change = -0.0533 × 100 = -5.33%
- **Balance at December 31, 2014**: $394 million (from the table data)
- **Balance at December 31, 2015**: $373 million (from the table data)
- Change = Balance at December 31, 2015 - Balance at December 31, 2014
- Change = $373 million - $394 million = -$21 million
- Percentage Change = (Change / Base) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-$21 million / $394 million) × 100
- Percentage Change = -0.0533 × 100 = -5.33%
