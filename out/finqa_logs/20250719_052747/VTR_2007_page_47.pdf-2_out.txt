=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the number of shares outstanding as of December 31, 2007?

**Calculation**: 
1. **Identify Initial Shares Outstanding**: 
   - From the text, we know that as of February 15, 2008, there were 138311810 shares of common stock outstanding.

2. **Adjust for Repurchases**: 
   - The table indicates that shares were repurchased during the quarter ended December 31, 2007. However, it does not specify the exact number of shares repurchased or any other transactions affecting the share count between December 31, 2007, and February 15, 2008.

3. **Conclusion**: 
   - Without specific data on the number of shares repurchased or issued during the quarter ended December 31, 2007, we cannot accurately calculate the number of shares outstanding as of December 31, 2007.

**Answer**: Additional context is required to determine the exact number of shares outstanding as of December 31, 2007. Specifically, we need the number of shares repurchased or any other adjustments made to the share count during the quarter ended December 31, 2007.

**Source**: Combined analysis of text and table data.

Answer Echoes:
- As of February 15, 2008, there were 138,311,810 shares of common stock outstanding.
- The table mentions repurchases of common stock during the quarter ended December 31, 2007, but does not provide specific numbers or the initial number of shares outstanding.
- The text provides the number of shares outstanding as of February 15, 2008, which is 138,311,810 shares.
- The table mentions that shares were repurchased during the quarter ended December 31, 2007, but does not specify the number of shares repurchased or the average price per share. Therefore, we cannot directly adjust the February 15, 2008, figure to determine the December 31, 2007, figure.
- Without specific data on the number of shares repurchased or issued between December 31, 2007, and February 15, 2008, we cannot accurately calculate the number of shares outstanding as of December 31, 2007.
- The number of shares repurchased during the quarter ended December 31, 2007.
- Any additional shares issued or other adjustments made to the share count during this period.
