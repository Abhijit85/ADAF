Answer Echoes:
- Tier 1 Capital in 2007: $82.0 billion
- Tier 1 Capital in 2008: $71.0 billion
- Difference = Tier 1 Capital in 2008 - Tier 1 Capital in 2007
- Difference = $71.0 billion - $82.0 billion
- Difference = -$11.0 billion
- The result is negative, indicating a decrease.
- Include units and sign
- **From Table**:
- Tier 1 Capital in 2007: $82.0 billion
- Tier 1 Capital in 2008: $71.0 billion
- Tier 1 Capital in 2007: $82.0 billion
- Tier 1 Capital in 2008: $71.0 billion
- Difference = Tier 1 Capital in 2008 - Tier 1 Capital in 2007
- Difference = $71.0 billion - $82.0 billion
- Difference = -$11.0 billion
- The result is negative, indicating a decrease.
- Include units and sign
