=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In 2005, what percentage of consumer packaging sales were represented by foodservice net sales?

**Calculation**: 
To determine the percentage of consumer packaging sales represented by foodservice net sales in 2005, we need the total consumer packaging net sales for that year. However, the provided information does not give a direct figure for total consumer packaging net sales. We only have the foodservice net sales figure, which is $437 million.

Given the lack of a total consumer packaging net sales figure, we cannot perform the calculation directly. If we had the total consumer packaging net sales, the calculation would be:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Foodservice Net Sales}}{\text{Total Consumer Packaging Net Sales}} \right) \times 100
\]

**Answer**: Unable to calculate the percentage without the total consumer packaging net sales figure for 2005.

**Source**: Combined analysis (text context provided foodservice net sales, but total consumer packaging net sales is missing).

Answer Echoes:
- **Consumer Packaging Net Sales in 2005**: The text states that consumer packaging net sales increased by 9% compared with 2005. However, it does not provide the exact figure for 2005 directly. We need to infer this from the context.
- **Foodservice Net Sales in 2005**: The text explicitly states that foodservice net sales were $437 million in 2005.
- The text mentions that coated paperboard net sales were $1.3 billion in 2005.
- It also mentions Shorewood net sales were $691 million in 2005.
- However, it does not provide a direct total for consumer packaging net sales, which would include these segments and potentially others.
- Since we do not have a direct total for consumer packaging net sales, we cannot calculate the percentage without making assumptions or having additional data.
- If we had the total consumer packaging net sales, the calculation would be:
