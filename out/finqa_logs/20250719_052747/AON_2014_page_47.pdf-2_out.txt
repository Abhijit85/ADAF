=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Considering the years 2013 and 2014, what is the basis point variation observed in the operating margin?

**Calculation**:
1. **Extract Operating Margins**:
   - From the text context, the operating margin for 2014 is 21.0% and for 2013 is 19.8%.

2. **Calculate the Difference in Percentage Points**:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 21.0\% - 19.8\% = 1.2\%
   \]

3. **Convert Percentage Points to Basis Points**:
   - 1 percentage point is equivalent to 100 basis points.
   - Therefore, 1.2 percentage points is equivalent to:
   \[
   1.2 \times 100 = 120 \text{ basis points}
   \]

**Answer**: The basis point variation observed in the operating margin between 2013 and 2014 is 120 basis points.

**Source**: Text context analysis.

Answer Echoes:
- Operating margin for 2014: 11.4%
- Operating margin for 2013: 7.8%
- 1 percentage point is equivalent to 100 basis points.
- Therefore, 3.6 percentage points is equivalent to:
- Operating margin for 2014: 21.0%
- Operating margin for 2013: 19.8%
- 1 percentage point is equivalent to 100 basis points.
- Therefore, 1.2 percentage points is equivalent to:
