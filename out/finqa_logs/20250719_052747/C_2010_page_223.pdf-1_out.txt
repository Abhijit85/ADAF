=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: At December 31, 2010, what was the percent of the net allowance to the carrying amount of the company's purchased distressed loan portfolio?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base**: The base for the percentage calculation is the carrying amount of the company's purchased distressed loan portfolio, which is $392 million (net of allowance).
2. **Identify Part**: The part is the allowance at December 31, 2010, which is $77 million.
3. **Calculate Percentage**: Use the formula \((\text{Part} / \text{Base}) \times 100\) to find the percentage.
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{77}{392}\right) \times 100
   \]
4. **Perform Calculation**:
   \[
   \frac{77}{392} \approx 0.1964
   \]
   \[
   0.1964 \times 100 = 19.64\%
   \]

**Answer**: 19.64%

**Source**: Combined analysis using both table data and text context. The carrying amount of $392 million is derived from the text context, which specifies it as net of the allowance, ensuring the calculation reflects the correct financial context.

Answer Echoes:
- Carrying amount of loan receivable = $469 million
- Allowance = $77 million
- **Carrying Amount of Loan Receivable**: $469 million
- **Allowance**: $77 million
- The carrying amount of the company's purchased distressed loan portfolio at December 31, 2010, was $392 million, net of an allowance of $77 million.
- Carrying amount = $392 million
- Allowance = $77 million
- Carrying amount of the loan portfolio: $392 million (net of allowance)
- Allowance: $77 million
- \((77 / 392) \times 100 = 19.64\%\)
