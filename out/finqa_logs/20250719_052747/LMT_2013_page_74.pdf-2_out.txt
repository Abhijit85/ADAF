=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the percentage of the total severance actions related to our aeronautics, space systems, and our IS&GS business segments and corporate headquarters in 2011 related to the aeronautics?

**Calculation**:
1. **Total Severance Actions in 2011**: $136 million
2. **Severance Actions Related to Aeronautics**: $49 million
3. **Percentage Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Severance Actions for Aeronautics}}{\text{Total Severance Actions}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{49}{136} \right) \times 100 \approx 36.03\%
   \]

**Answer**: The percentage of the total severance actions in 2011 related to the aeronautics segment was approximately 36.03%.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Total severance actions in 2011: $136 million
- Severance actions related to aeronautics: $49 million
- Severance actions related to space systems: $48 million
- Severance actions related to IS&GS and corporate headquarters: $39 million
- Total severance actions in 2011: $136 million
- Severance actions related to aeronautics: $49 million
- Percentage = (49 / 136) × 100 ≈ 36.03%
