=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: If the fuel surcharge grows by the same rate as in 2014, what would expected 2015 revenues be in billions?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the 2014 Fuel Surcharge Revenues**:  
   From the context, the fuel surcharge revenues for 2014 were $2.8 billion.

2. **Identify the Growth Rate from 2014**:  
   The growth rate for the fuel surcharge from 2013 to 2014 was 6%.

3. **Calculate the Expected 2015 Fuel Surcharge Revenues**:  
   To find the expected fuel surcharge revenues for 2015, we apply the 6% growth rate to the 2014 fuel surcharge revenues.

   \[
   \text{Expected 2015 Fuel Surcharge Revenues} = \text{2014 Fuel Surcharge Revenues} \times (1 + \text{Growth Rate})
   \]

   \[
   \text{Expected 2015 Fuel Surcharge Revenues} = 2.8 \times (1 + 0.06)
   \]

   \[
   \text{Expected 2015 Fuel Surcharge Revenues} = 2.8 \times 1.06
   \]

   \[
   \text{Expected 2015 Fuel Surcharge Revenues} = 2.968 \text{ billion}
   \]

**Answer**: 2.968 billion

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context regarding fuel surcharge revenues and growth rate.
