=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In 2005, what was the percent of the Investment Banking as part of the total segments operations?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base**: Total Operating Earnings for all segments in 2005 = $10521 million.
2. **Identify Part**: Investment Banking Operating Earnings in 2005 = $3658 million.
3. **Calculate Percentage**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Investment Banking Operating Earnings}}{\text{Total Operating Earnings}}\right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{3658}{10521}\right) \times 100 = 34.77\%
   \]

**Answer**: In 2005, Investment Banking accounted for 34.77% of the total segments' operating earnings.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Total Operating Earnings (2005) = $10,521 million
- Investment Banking Operating Earnings (2005) = $3,658 million
- **Total Operating Earnings (2005)**: $10,521 million
- **Investment Banking Operating Earnings (2005)**: $3,658 million
- The context provides additional information about the allocation methodologies and financial reporting practices, but it does not alter the numerical values needed for this calculation.
- Total Operating Earnings (2005) = $10,521 million
- Investment Banking Operating Earnings (2005) = $3,658 million
- Percentage = \((3,658 / 10,521) \times 100 = 34.77\%\)
