=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What portion of tax benefit would affect the effective tax rate if recognized as of December 31, 2011?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the relevant components for 2011**:
   - Additions for tax positions of prior years: $22 million
   - Reductions for tax positions of prior years: $(1) million
   - Additions based on tax positions related to the current year: $46 million
   - Settlements: $(25) million
   - Positions assumed in acquisitions: $0 million

2. **Calculate the net change in tax positions for 2011**:
   - Net change = Additions for prior years + Reductions for prior years + Additions for current year + Settlements
   - Net change = $22 million - $1 million + $46 million - $25 million
   - Net change = $42 million

3. **Determine the portion that would affect the effective tax rate**:
   - The net change of $42 million represents the total tax benefit adjustments for 2011.
   - This amount would directly affect the effective tax rate if recognized, as it represents changes in tax positions that impact the company's tax liabilities.

**Answer**: $42 million would affect the effective tax rate if recognized as of December 31, 2011.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- **Additions for tax positions of prior years**: $22 million
- **Reductions for tax positions of prior years**: $(1) million
- **Additions based on tax positions related to the current year**: $46 million
- **Settlements**: $(25) million
- **Positions assumed in acquisitions**: $0 million (since it's not listed for 2011)
- Net change = Additions for prior years + Reductions for prior years + Additions for current year + Settlements
- Net change = $22 million - $1 million + $46 million - $25 million
- Net change = $42 million
- The net change of $42 million represents the total tax benefit adjustments for 2011.
- This amount would directly affect the effective tax rate if recognized, as it represents changes in tax positions that impact the company's tax liabilities.
- **Additions for tax positions of prior years**: $22 million
- **Reductions for tax positions of prior years**: $(1) million
- **Additions based on tax positions related to the current year**: $46 million
- **Settlements**: $(25) million
- **Positions assumed in acquisitions**: $0 million
- The text mentions that included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2011, are $226 million of tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.
- Net change = Additions for prior years + Reductions for prior years + Additions for current year + Settlements
- Net change = $22 million - $1 million + $46 million - $25 million
- Net change = $42 million
- The net change of $42 million represents the total tax benefit adjustments for 2011.
- This amount would directly affect the effective tax rate if recognized, as it represents changes in tax positions that impact the company's tax liabilities.
