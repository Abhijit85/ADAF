=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the percent of the total self-insurance reserves that was classified as current in 2018?

**Calculation**:
1. Extract relevant data from the text:
   - Total self-insurance reserves as of December 31, 2018: $105 million
   - Current portion of self-insurance reserves as of December 31, 2018: $52 million

2. Use the formula for percentage to calculate the current portion of the reserves:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of Current Reserves} = \left( \frac{\text{Current Reserves}}{\text{Total Reserves}} \right) \times 100
   \]

3. Substitute the extracted values into the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of Current Reserves} = \left( \frac{52}{105} \right) \times 100
   \]

4. Perform the calculation:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of Current Reserves} = 0.4952 \times 100 = 49.52\%
   \]

**Answer**: 49.52% of the total self-insurance reserves was classified as current in 2018.

**Source**: Text context (as the table did not provide the necessary data).

Answer Echoes:
- Total self-insurance reserves as of December 31, 2018: $105 million
- Current portion of self-insurance reserves as of December 31, 2018: $52 million
