=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Considering the years 2015-2016, what is the decrease observed in the cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the values for each year**:
   - 2015 Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments: $137.5 million
   - 2016 Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments: $79.3 million

2. **Calculate the decrease**:
   - Decrease = 2015 amount - 2016 amount
   - Decrease = $137.5 million - $79.3 million

3. **Perform the subtraction**:
   - Decrease = $58.2 million

**Answer**: The decrease observed in the cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans between the years 2015 and 2016 is $58.2 million.

**Source**: Text context (as the table did not provide the necessary data).

Answer Echoes:
- **2015 Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments**: $137.5 million
- **2016 Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments**: $79.3 million
- 2015: $137.5 million
- 2016: $79.3 million
- Decrease = 2015 amount - 2016 amount
- Decrease = $137.5 million - $79.3 million
- Decrease = $58.2 million
