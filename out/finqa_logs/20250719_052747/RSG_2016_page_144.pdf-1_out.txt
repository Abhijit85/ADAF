=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the ratio of the gallons hedged in 2017 to 2018?

**Calculation**:
1. Identify the gallons hedged for each year:
   - Gallons Hedged in 2017: 12000000
   - Gallons Hedged in 2018: 3000000
2. Calculate the ratio:
   - Ratio = Gallons Hedged in 2017 / Gallons Hedged in 2018
   - Ratio = 12000000 / 3000000
   - Ratio = 4

**Answer**: The ratio of the gallons hedged in 2017 to 2018 is 4:1.

**Source**: Table data.

Answer Echoes:
- We need to find the ratio of "Gallons Hedged" in 2017 to 2018.
- Gallons Hedged in 2017: 12,000,000
- Gallons Hedged in 2018: 3,000,000
- Ratio = Gallons Hedged in 2017 / Gallons Hedged in 2018
- Ratio = 12,000,000 / 3,000,000
- Ratio = 4
- The ratio of the gallons hedged in 2017 to 2018 is 4:1.
- **Arithmetic Type**: Ratio
- **Data Requirements**: Gallons hedged in 2017 and 2018
- **Context Needs**: No additional context needed from the text as the table provides the necessary data.
- **Gallons Hedged in 2017**: 12,000,000 gallons
- **Gallons Hedged in 2018**: 3,000,000 gallons
- **Calculation Steps**:
- Ratio = Gallons Hedged in 2017 / Gallons Hedged in 2018
- Ratio = 12,000,000 / 3,000,000
- Ratio = 4
