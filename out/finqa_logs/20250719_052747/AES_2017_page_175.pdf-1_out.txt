=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What percent of the receivable balances in Puerto Rico as of December 31, 2017, was current?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Current Receivable Balances**:
   - Current receivable balances = Total receivable balances - Overdue receivable balances
   - Current receivable balances = $86 million - $53 million = $33 million

2. **Calculate the Percentage of Current Receivable Balances**:
   - Percentage of current receivable balances = (Current receivable balances / Total receivable balances) × 100
   - Percentage of current receivable balances = ($33 million / $86 million) × 100

3. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - Percentage = (33 / 86) × 100 ≈ 38.37%

**Answer**: Approximately 38.37% of the receivable balances in Puerto Rico as of December 31, 2017, were current.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context.

Answer Echoes:
- **Total receivable balances in Puerto Rico**: $86 million
- **Overdue receivable balances**: $53 million
- Current receivable balances = Total receivable balances - Overdue receivable balances
- Current receivable balances = $86 million - $53 million = $33 million
- Percentage of current receivable balances = (Current receivable balances / Total receivable balances) × 100
- Percentage of current receivable balances = ($33 million / $86 million) × 100
- Percentage = (33 / 86) × 100 ≈ 38.37%
- Current receivable balances = $86 million - $53 million = $33 million
- Percentage of current receivable balances = ($33 million / $86 million) × 100 ≈ 38.37%
