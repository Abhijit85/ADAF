=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the percentage change in net revenue in 2011?

**Calculation**: 
To calculate the percentage change in net revenue for 2011, we need the net revenue figures for both 2010 and 2011. However, the provided data only includes net revenue for 2009 and 2010, which are $536.7 million and $555.3 million, respectively. Without the net revenue figure for 2011, we cannot perform the calculation for the percentage change from 2010 to 2011.

**Answer**: Unable to calculate the percentage change in net revenue for 2011 due to missing data for 2011 net revenue.

**Source**: Combined analysis of table data and text context. The table provides net revenue figures for 2009 and 2010, but there is no information available for 2011 in the provided context.

Answer Echoes:
- The text does not provide explicit net revenue figures for 2011. It mentions various changes in expenses and revenues but does not provide a direct net revenue figure for 2011.
- 2009 Net Revenue: $536.7 million
- 2010 Net Revenue: $555.3 million
