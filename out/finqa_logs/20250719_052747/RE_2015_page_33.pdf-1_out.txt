=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the book-to-market ratio of the commercial mortgage-backed securities?

**Calculation**:
To calculate the book-to-market ratio, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Book-to-Market Ratio} = \frac{\text{Book Value}}{\text{Market Value}}
\]

From the text context, we have:
- **Book Value of CMBS**: $264.9 million
- **Market Value of CMBS**: $266.3 million

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
\text{Book-to-Market Ratio} = \frac{264.9}{266.3} \approx 0.9947
\]

**Answer**: The book-to-market ratio of the commercial mortgage-backed securities is approximately 0.9947.

**Source**: Text Context

Answer Echoes:
- **Book Value of CMBS**: $264.9 million
- **Market Value of CMBS**: $266.3 million
