=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the applied 2019's net sales in 2018, in billions?

**Calculation**: 
To determine the net sales for 2018, we need the RD&E spending for that year and the percentage it represents of net sales. The text provides an average RD&E spending of 14% of net sales over the last five years. However, without the specific RD&E spending amount for 2018, we cannot calculate the net sales for that year.

**Answer**: Additional context required. The specific RD&E spending amount for 2018 is needed to calculate the net sales for that year using the average percentage of 14%.

**Source**: Text context analysis.

Answer Echoes:
- **Arithmetic Type**: Percentage calculation
- **Data Requirements**: Net sales figures for 2018
- **Context Needs**: Percentage of net sales spent on RD&E
- **Calculation Steps**: Use the percentage of net sales spent on RD&E to back-calculate net sales
- **RD&E Spending in 2013**: $1.3 billion, which is 18% of net sales
- **RD&E Spending in 2012**: $1.2 billion, which is 14% of net sales
- **RD&E Spending in 2011**: $1.1 billion, which is 11% of net sales
- **Average RD&E Spending**: 14% of net sales over the last five years
- We know that RD&E spending as a percentage of net sales has averaged 14% over the last five years. We can use this average percentage to estimate net sales for 2018 if we assume similar spending patterns.
