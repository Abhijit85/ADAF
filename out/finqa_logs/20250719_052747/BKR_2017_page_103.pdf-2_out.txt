=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the risk-free interest of the stock-based compensation expense in 2017?

**Calculation**: The risk-free interest rate is directly extracted from the table, which lists it as 2.1%. This rate is used in the valuation of stock-based compensation, typically within models like the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The text context confirms that this rate is based on the observed U.S. Treasury yield curve at the time the options were granted.

**Answer**: 2.1%

**Source**: Table (with confirmation from text context)

Answer Echoes:
- **Arithmetic Type**: Direct extraction
- **Data Requirements**: Risk-free interest rate for stock-based compensation
- **Context Needs**: Understanding of how the risk-free interest rate is used in stock-based compensation valuation
- **Calculation Steps**: None needed beyond extraction
- **Additional Context**: The text explains that the risk-free interest rate is part of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for valuing stock options.
- **Definitions**: The risk-free interest rate is based on the observed U.S. Treasury yield curve at the time the options were granted.
- **None Required**: The question requires direct extraction of the risk-free interest rate.
