=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What percent of assets acquired by the acquisition are non-tangible assets?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Non-Tangible Assets**:
   - Goodwill: $13536
   - Customer-related intangible assets: $4091
   - Contract-based intangible assets: $1031

2. **Calculate Total Non-Tangible Assets**:
   - Total Non-Tangible Assets = Goodwill + Customer-related intangible assets + Contract-based intangible assets
   - Total Non-Tangible Assets = $13536 + $4091 + $1031 = $18658

3. **Identify Total Assets Acquired**:
   - Total Assets Acquired = $19427

4. **Calculate Percentage of Non-Tangible Assets**:
   - Percentage = (Total Non-Tangible Assets / Total Assets Acquired) × 100
   - Percentage = ($18658 / $19427) × 100
   - Percentage = 0.9605 × 100 = 96.05%

**Answer**: 96.05% of the assets acquired by the acquisition are non-tangible assets.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Goodwill: $13,536
- Customer-related intangible assets: $4,091
- Contract-based intangible assets: $1,031
- Total Non-Tangible Assets = Goodwill + Customer-related intangible assets + Contract-based intangible assets
- Total Non-Tangible Assets = $13,536 + $4,091 + $1,031 = $18,658
- Total Assets Acquired = $19,427
- Percentage = (Total Non-Tangible Assets / Total Assets Acquired) × 100
- Percentage = ($18,658 / $19,427) × 100
- Percentage = 0.9605 × 100 = 96.05%
- **Arithmetic Type**: Percentage calculation
- **Data Requirements**: Values of non-tangible assets and total assets acquired
- **Context Needs**: Understanding of what constitutes non-tangible assets
- **Non-Tangible Assets**:
- Goodwill: $13,536
- Customer-related intangible assets: $4,091
- Contract-based intangible assets: $1,031
- **Total Non-Tangible Assets**: $18,658 (calculated as $13,536 + $4,091 + $1,031)
- **Total Assets Acquired**: $19,427
- **Calculate Percentage of Non-Tangible Assets**:
- Formula: \((\text{Total Non-Tangible Assets} / \text{Total Assets Acquired}) \times 100\)
- Calculation: \((18,658 / 19,427) \times 100\)
- Total Non-Tangible Assets = $18,658
- Total Assets Acquired = $19,427
- Percentage = \((18,658 / 19,427) \times 100\)
- Percentage = \(0.9605 \times 100 = 96.05\%\)
- The calculation is reasonable given the high proportion of non-tangible assets relative to total assets.
- Present the percentage with appropriate precision.
