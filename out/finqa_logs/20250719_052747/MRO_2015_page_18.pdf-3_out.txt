=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the total net undeveloped acres expiring for the three-year period, in thousands?

**Calculation**:
1. **Extract Values from the Table**:
   - Total for 2016: 257 (in thousands)
   - Total for 2017: 4533 (in thousands)
   - Total for 2018: 1018 (in thousands)

2. **Sum the Values**:
   - Total expiring acres over the three years = 257 + 4533 + 1018

3. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - \( 257 + 4533 = 4790 \)
   - \( 4790 + 1018 = 5808 \)

**Answer**: 5808 (in thousands)

**Source**: Table data

The total net undeveloped acres expiring for the three-year period is 5808 thousand acres.

Answer Echoes:
- Total for 2016: 257 (in thousands)
- Total for 2017: 4,533 (in thousands)
- Total for 2018: 1,018 (in thousands)
- Total expiring acres over the three years = 257 + 4,533 + 1,018
- 257 + 4,533 = 4,790
- 4,790 + 1,018 = 5,808
- \( 257 + 4,533 = 4,790 \) thousand acres
- \( 4,790 + 1,018 = 5,808 \) thousand acres
