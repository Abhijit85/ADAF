Answer Echoes:
- The text states: "We repurchased nearly 5.0 million common shares for $ 240.0 million in 2010."
- Total amount spent on repurchases: $240.0 million
- Number of shares repurchased: 5.0 million shares
- Average price per share = Total amount spent / Number of shares repurchased
- Average price per share = $240.0 million / 5.0 million shares
- Average price per share = $240,000,000 / 5,000,000
- Average price per share = $48.00
- Total amount spent on repurchases: $240.0 million
- Number of shares repurchased: 5.0 million shares
- Average price per share = $240.0 million / 5.0 million shares = $48.00
