=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What are the net earnings attributable to PMI in the previous year, (in billions)?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Known Values**:
   - Net earnings for 2017: $6.0 billion
   - Percentage decrease from 2016 to 2017: 13.4%

2. **Set Up the Equation**:
   - Let \( E_{2016} \) be the net earnings for 2016.
   - The relationship between 2016 and 2017 earnings is given by:
     \[
     E_{2017} = E_{2016} \times (1 - \text{Percentage Decrease})
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     6.0 = E_{2016} \times (1 - 0.134)
     \]
     \[
     6.0 = E_{2016} \times 0.866
     \]

3. **Solve for \( E_{2016} \)**:
   \[
   E_{2016} = \frac{6.0}{0.866} \approx 6.928 \text{ billion}
   \]

**Answer**: The net earnings attributable to PMI in the previous year (2016) were approximately $6.928 billion.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context (net earnings for 2017 and percentage decrease).

Answer Echoes:
- **Arithmetic Type**: Difference
- **Data Requirements**: Net earnings for 2017 and the percentage decrease from 2016 to 2017
- **Context Needs**: Net earnings for 2017 and the percentage decrease
- **Net Earnings for 2017**: $6.0 billion
- **Percentage Decrease from 2016 to 2017**: 13.4%
- Let \( E_{2016} \) be the net earnings for 2016.
- Given that net earnings for 2017 are $6.0 billion and this represents a 13.4% decrease from 2016, we can set up the equation:
