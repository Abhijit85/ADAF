=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What portion of total assets acquired is composed of goodwill?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base**: Total assets acquired = $19427
2. **Identify Part**: Goodwill = $13536
3. **Calculate Percentage**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of Goodwill} = \left(\frac{\text{Goodwill}}{\text{Total assets acquired}}\right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage of Goodwill} = \left(\frac{13536}{19427}\right) \times 100
   \]
4. **Perform Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of Goodwill} = 0.6966 \times 100 = 69.66\%
   \]

**Answer**: 69.66% of the total assets acquired is composed of goodwill.

**Source**: Table data.

Answer Echoes:
- **Arithmetic Type**: Percentage calculation
- **Data Requirements**: Total assets acquired and goodwill amount
- **Context Needs**: None beyond what's provided
- **Calculation Steps**: Calculate the percentage of goodwill relative to total assets acquired
- **Exact Numbers**:
- Total assets acquired: $19,427
- Goodwill: $13,536
- **Composition Percentages**: Determine what percentage of the total assets is made up of goodwill.
- Total assets acquired = $19,427
- Goodwill = $13,536
- These values are directly provided in the table data.
- Divide the goodwill amount by the total assets acquired: \( \frac{13,536}{19,427} \approx 0.6966 \)
- Multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage: \( 0.6966 \times 100 = 69.66\% \)
- The calculation is straightforward and the result seems reasonable given the data.
- Present the final result with appropriate precision.
