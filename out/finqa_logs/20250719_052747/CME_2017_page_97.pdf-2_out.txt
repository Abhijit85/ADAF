=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In 2017, what was the percent of the common stock authorized that was issued and outstanding for the Class A common stock?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base and Part**:
   - Base: Total Class A common stock authorized in 2017 = 1000000
   - Part: Class A common stock issued and outstanding in 2017 = 339235

2. **Calculate the Percentage**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Issued and Outstanding}}{\text{Authorized}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{339235}{1000000} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = 0.339235 \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = 33.9235\%
   \]

3. **Format the Result**:
   - Rounded to two decimal places: 33.92%

**Answer**: 33.92% (rounded to two decimal places)

**Source**: Table data (Class A common stock authorized = 1000000; issued and outstanding = 339235)

Answer Echoes:
- **Base**: The total Class A common stock authorized in 2017.
- **Part**: The Class A common stock issued and outstanding in 2017.
- **Class A common stock authorized**: 1,000,000
- **Class A common stock issued and outstanding**: 339,235
- **From Table:**
- Class A common stock authorized: 1,000,000
- Class A common stock issued and outstanding: 339,235
- **From Text Context:**
- No additional context from the text is required for this calculation as the table provides all necessary numerical data.
- Base: Total Class A common stock authorized in 2017.
- Part: Class A common stock issued and outstanding in 2017.
- Rounded to two decimal places: 33.92%
