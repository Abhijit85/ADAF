=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the ratio of the net income to the revenues in 2010?

**Calculation**: 
1. **Net Revenue for 2010**: $540.2 million (from table data).
2. **Net Income for 2010**: The net income for 2010 is not directly provided. However, it is mentioned that net income increased by $2.4 million from 2009 to 2010. Without the net income for 2009, we cannot determine the exact net income for 2010.
3. **Ratio Calculation**: To calculate the ratio of net income to revenues, we need both the net income and the net revenue for 2010. Since the net income is not available, the ratio cannot be calculated.

**Answer**: The ratio of net income to revenues for 2010 cannot be determined with the provided data, as the net income for 2010 is not available.

**Source**: Combined analysis (table data for revenue and text context for net income change).

Answer Echoes:
- **Net Income**: This is not directly provided in the table. We need additional information to determine the net income for 2010.
- **Revenues**: The 2010 net revenue is given as $540.2 million.
- **2010 Net Revenue**: $540.2 million
- From the financial context, it is mentioned that net income increased by $2.4 million from 2009 to 2010. However, the exact net income for 2010 is not directly provided.
- We need to deduce the net income for 2010 using the information given for 2011 and the increase from 2009 to 2010.
- The table data provides the net revenue for 2010 as $540.2 million.
- The context states that net income increased by $2.4 million from 2009 to 2010.
- Without the exact net income for 2009, we cannot directly calculate the net income for 2010 from the provided data.
- However, we know that net income for 2011 increased by $14.6 million from 2010. If we had the net income for 2011, we could work backward to find the 2010 figure.
- The ratio of net income to revenues for 2010 requires both the net income and the net revenue for that year.
- Since the net income for 2010 is not directly available from the provided data, we cannot compute this ratio without additional information.
