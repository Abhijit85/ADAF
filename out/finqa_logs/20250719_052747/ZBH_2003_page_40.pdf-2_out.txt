**Calculation**:
1. Identify the operating profit percentages for Europe from the table:
   - 2003: 26.3%
   - 2001: 19.5%
2. Calculate the difference in percentages:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 26.3\% - 19.5\% = 6.8\%
   \]

**Answer**: The difference in operating profit for Europe as a percentage of net sales between 2001 and 2003 is 6.8%.

**Source**: Table data.

Answer Echoes:
- **2003**: 26.3%
- **2001**: 19.5%
- **Arithmetic Type**: Difference in percentages
- **Data Requirements**: Operating profit percentages for Europe in 2001 and 2003
- **Context Needs**: Confirm the years and percentages from the provided data
- **Exact Numbers**:
- 2003 Operating Profit for Europe: 26.3%
- 2001 Operating Profit for Europe: 19.5%
- The text does not provide additional numerical data for this specific question but confirms the context of operating profit changes over the years.
- **Difference Calculation**: Subtract the 2001 percentage from the 2003 percentage to find the change.
- 2003: 26.3%
- 2001: 19.5%
- \[ \text{Difference} = 26.3\% - 19.5\% = 6.8\% \]
