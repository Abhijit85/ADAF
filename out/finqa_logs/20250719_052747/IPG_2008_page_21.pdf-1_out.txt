=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: How much more, in percent, was spent on October shares than November shares?

**Calculation**:
1. **Calculate Total Amount Spent in October**:
   \[
   \text{Total Amount Spent in October} = 29704 \, \text{shares} \times \$5.99/\text{share} = \$177978.96
   \]

2. **Calculate Total Amount Spent in November**:
   \[
   \text{Total Amount Spent in November} = 4468 \, \text{shares} \times \$3.24/\text{share} = \$14482.32
   \]

3. **Calculate the Difference in Amount Spent**:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \$177978.96 - \$14482.32 = \$163496.64
   \]

4. **Calculate the Percentage Difference**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Difference} = \left(\frac{\text{Difference}}{\text{Total Amount Spent in November}}\right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage Difference} = \left(\frac{\$163496.64}{\$14482.32}\right) \times 100 \approx 1129.00\%
   \]

**Answer**: The amount spent on October shares was approximately 1129.00% more than the amount spent on November shares.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Total Number of Shares Purchased in October = 29,704
- Average Price Paid per Share in October = $5.99
- Total Amount Spent in October = 29,704 shares × $5.99/share = $177,978.96
- Total Number of Shares Purchased in November = 4,468
- Average Price Paid per Share in November = $3.24
- Total Amount Spent in November = 4,468 shares × $3.24/share = $14,482.32
- Difference = Total Amount Spent in October - Total Amount Spent in November
- Difference = $177,978.96 - $14,482.32 = $163,496.64
- Percentage Difference = (Difference / Total Amount Spent in November) × 100
- Percentage Difference = ($163,496.64 / $14,482.32) × 100 ≈ 1129.00%
- **October:**
- Total Number of Shares Purchased = 29,704
- Average Price Paid per Share = $5.99
- **November:**
- Total Number of Shares Purchased = 4,468
- Average Price Paid per Share = $3.24
- October: 29,704 shares at $5.99/share
- November: 4,468 shares at $3.24/share
- Total spent in October: $177,978.96
- Total spent in November: $14,482.32
- Difference: $163,496.64
- Percentage difference: 1129.00%
