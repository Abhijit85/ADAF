=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the percentage growth of the aggregate fair values of our outstanding fuel hedge from 2014 to 2015?

**Calculation**:
1. Extract the necessary data from the text context:
   - Aggregate fair value of outstanding fuel hedges as of December 31, 2014: $34.4 million
   - Aggregate fair value of outstanding fuel hedges as of December 31, 2015: $37.8 million

2. Use the formula for percentage growth:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Growth} = \left( \frac{\text{Value in 2015} - \text{Value in 2014}}{\text{Value in 2014}} \right) \times 100
   \]

3. Substitute the extracted values into the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Growth} = \left( \frac{37.8 - 34.4}{34.4} \right) \times 100
   \]

4. Perform the arithmetic:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Growth} = \left( \frac{3.4}{34.4} \right) \times 100
   \]

5. Calculate the result:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Growth} = 0.0988372093 \times 100
   \]

6. Final result:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Growth} = 9.88\%
   \]

**Answer**: The percentage growth of the aggregate fair values of our outstanding fuel hedge from 2014 to 2015 is 9.88%.

**Source**: Text context (data extracted from text, not available in the table).

Answer Echoes:
- Aggregate fair value of outstanding fuel hedges as of December 31, 2014: $34.4 million
- Aggregate fair value of outstanding fuel hedges as of December 31, 2015: $37.8 million
