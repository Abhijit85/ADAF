=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the change in net sales in millions in 2007 in billions?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Values**:
   - Sales in 2007: $5245 million
   - Sales in 2006: $4925 million

2. **Calculate the Change in Sales**:
   - Change in Sales = Sales in 2007 - Sales in 2006
   - Calculation: $5245 million - $4925 million = $320 million

3. **Convert the Change to Billions**:
   - Since 1 billion = 1000 million, convert $320 million to billions.
   - Conversion: $320 million / 1000 = $0.32 billion

**Answer**: The change in net sales in 2007 was $320 million, which is equivalent to $0.32 billion.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- **Sales in 2007**: $5,245 million
- **Sales in 2006**: $4,925 million
- **Change in Sales** = Sales in 2007 - Sales in 2006
- **Calculation**: $5,245 million - $4,925 million = $320 million
- Since 1 billion = 1,000 million, we convert $320 million to billions.
- **Conversion**: $320 million / 1,000 = $0.32 billion
- **Sales in 2007**: $5,245 million
- **Sales in 2006**: $4,925 million
- The text confirms the net sales for industrial packaging in 2007 increased by 6% from 2006, which aligns with the table data.
- Sales in 2007: $5,245 million
- Sales in 2006: $4,925 million
- Change in Sales = Sales in 2007 - Sales in 2006
- Calculation: $5,245 million - $4,925 million = $320 million
- Since 1 billion = 1,000 million, convert $320 million to billions.
- Conversion: $320 million / 1,000 = $0.32 billion
