**Calculation**:
1. Identify the percentage of sales to restaurants for each year:
   - 2019: 62%
   - 2018: 62%
2. Calculate the difference:
   - Difference = Percentage in 2019 - Percentage in 2018
   - Difference = 62% - 62% = 0%

**Source**: Table data.

Answer Echoes:
- Percentage of sales to restaurants in 2019: 62%
- Percentage of sales to restaurants in 2018: 62%
- Difference = Percentage in 2019 - Percentage in 2018
- Difference = 62% - 62% = 0%
- The difference is 0%, indicating no change.
- The change in percentage is 0%.
- Percentage in 2019: 62%
- Percentage in 2018: 62%
- Difference = Percentage in 2019 - Percentage in 2018
- Difference = 62% - 62% = 0%
- The difference is 0%, indicating no change.
- The change in percentage is 0%.
