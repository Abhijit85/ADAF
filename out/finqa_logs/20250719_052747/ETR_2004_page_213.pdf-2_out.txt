=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What are the deferred fuel cost revisions as a percentage of the increase in fuel cost recovery revenues?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Increase in Fuel Cost Recovery Revenues**:
   - From the text context, the increase in fuel cost recovery revenues is $98.0 million.

2. **Identify the Deferred Fuel Cost Revisions**:
   - From the table data, the deferred fuel cost revisions are $59.1 million.

3. **Calculate the Deferred Fuel Cost Revisions as a Percentage of the Increase in Fuel Cost Recovery Revenues**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Deferred Fuel Cost Revisions}}{\text{Increase in Fuel Cost Recovery Revenues}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{59.1}{98.0} \right) \times 100
   \]

4. **Perform the Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = (0.6020408163265306) \times 100 \approx 60.20\%
   \]

**Answer**: The deferred fuel cost revisions represent approximately 60.20% of the increase in fuel cost recovery revenues.

**Source**: Combined analysis using both table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- **2002 Net Revenue**: $922.9 million
- **2003 Net Revenue**: $973.7 million
- From the financial context, the increase in fuel cost recovery revenues is mentioned as $98.0 million.
- From the table data, the deferred fuel cost revisions are given as $59.1 million.
- The increase in fuel cost recovery revenues is $98.0 million.
- The deferred fuel cost revisions are $59.1 million.
- Use the formula for percentage calculation:
- Substitute the values:
- \[
- Increase in Fuel Cost Recovery Revenues: $98.0 million
- Deferred Fuel Cost Revisions: $59.1 million
- Percentage Calculation: \((59.1 / 98.0) \times 100 \approx 60.20\%\)
