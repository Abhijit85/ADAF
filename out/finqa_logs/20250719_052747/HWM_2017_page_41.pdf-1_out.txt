=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Considering the reverse stock split, what was the percentual reduction of the common stock outstanding shares?

**Calculation**:
1. **Reverse Stock Split Ratio**: 1-for-3, meaning every three shares were consolidated into one.
2. **Shares Before and After the Split**:
   - Before the split: Approximately 1.3 billion shares.
   - After the split: Approximately 0.4 billion shares.
3. **Determine the Reduction in Shares**:
   - Reduction in shares = Initial shares - Final shares = 1.3 billion - 0.4 billion = 0.9 billion
4. **Calculate the Percentual Reduction**:
   - Percentual reduction = (Reduction in shares / Initial shares) × 100
   - Percentual reduction = (0.9 billion / 1.3 billion) × 100 ≈ 69.23%

**Answer**: The percentual reduction of the common stock outstanding shares due to the reverse stock split was approximately 69.23%.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Before the split: Approximately 1.3 billion shares.
- After the split: Approximately 0.4 billion shares.
- Initial shares = 1.3 billion
- Final shares = 0.4 billion
- Reduction in shares = Initial shares - Final shares = 1.3 billion - 0.4 billion = 0.9 billion
- Percentual reduction = (Reduction in shares / Initial shares) × 100
- Percentual reduction = (0.9 billion / 1.3 billion) × 100
- Percentual reduction = (0.9 / 1.3) × 100 ≈ 69.23%
