=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the percentage change in net fair value of derivatives outstanding between 2007 and 2008 in thousands?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Initial and Final Values**:
   - Initial Value (2007): $25171 (thousands of dollars)
   - Final Value (2008): $258800 (thousands of dollars)

2. **Calculate the Change in Value**:
   - Change in Value = Final Value - Initial Value
   - Change in Value = $258800 - $25171 = $233629 (thousands of dollars)

3. **Calculate the Percentage Change**:
   - Percentage Change Formula: \((\text{Change in Value} / \text{Initial Value}) \times 100\)
   - Calculation: \((233629 / 25171) \times 100 \approx 928.06\%\)

**Answer**: The percentage change in net fair value of derivatives outstanding between 2007 and 2008 is approximately 928.06%.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- **Base (Initial Value)**: Net fair value of derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2007 = $25,171 (thousands of dollars)
- **Part (Final Value)**: Net fair value of derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2008 = $258,800 (thousands of dollars)
- **Change in Value**: Final Value - Initial Value = $258,800 - $25,171 = $233,629 (thousands of dollars)
- **Percentage Change Formula**: \((\text{Change in Value} / \text{Initial Value}) \times 100\)
- **Calculation**: \((233,629 / 25,171) \times 100 \approx 928.06\%\)
- **Answer**: The percentage change in net fair value of derivatives outstanding between 2007 and 2008 is approximately 928.06%.
- **Base (Initial Value)**: Net fair value of derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2007 = $25,171 (thousands of dollars)
- **Part (Final Value)**: Net fair value of derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2008 = $258,800 (thousands of dollars)
- Change in Value = Final Value - Initial Value
- Change in Value = $258,800 - $25,171 = $233,629 (thousands of dollars)
- Percentage Change Formula: \((\text{Change in Value} / \text{Initial Value}) \times 100\)
- Calculation: \((233,629 / 25,171) \times 100 \approx 928.06\%\)
- Change in Value = $233,629 (thousands)
- Percentage Change = 928.06%
