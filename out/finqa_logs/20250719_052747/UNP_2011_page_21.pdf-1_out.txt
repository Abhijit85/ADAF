=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: For the 4th quarter of 2011, approximately how much was spent on stock repurchases?

**Calculation**:
1. **October Expenditure**:
   - Total Number of Shares Purchased: 379488
   - Average Price Paid Per Share: $87.46
   - Expenditure for October = 379488 shares × $87.46/share = $33200820.48

2. **November Expenditure**:
   - Total Number of Shares Purchased: 1748964
   - Average Price Paid Per Share: $98.41
   - Expenditure for November = 1748964 shares × $98.41/share = $172161502.24

3. **December Expenditure**:
   - Total Number of Shares Purchased: 1787343
   - Average Price Paid Per Share: $100.26
   - Expenditure for December = 1787343 shares × $100.26/share = $179243338.38

4. **Total Expenditure for the 4th Quarter**:
   - Total Expenditure = October Expenditure + November Expenditure + December Expenditure
   - Total Expenditure = $33200820.48 + $172161502.24 + $179243338.38 = $384605661.10

**Answer**: Approximately $384605661.10 was spent on stock repurchases in the 4th quarter of 2011.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Total Number of Shares Purchased: 379,488
- Average Price Paid Per Share: $87.46
- Expenditure for October = 379,488 shares × $87.46/share = $33,200,820.48
- Total Number of Shares Purchased: 1,748,964
- Average Price Paid Per Share: $98.41
- Expenditure for November = 1,748,964 shares × $98.41/share = $172,161,502.24
- Total Number of Shares Purchased: 1,787,343
- Average Price Paid Per Share: $100.26
- Expenditure for December = 1,787,343 shares × $100.26/share = $179,243,338.38
- Total Expenditure = October Expenditure + November Expenditure + December Expenditure
- Total Expenditure = $33,200,820.48 + $172,161,502.24 + $179,243,338.38 = $384,605,661.10
- From the table data, we have the following information for each month in the 4th quarter of 2011:
- **October**:
- Total Number of Shares Purchased: 379,488

- **November**:
- Total Number of Shares Purchased: 1,748,964
- Average Price Paid Per Share: $98.41
- Expenditure for November = 1,748,964 shares × $98.41/share = $172,161,502.24
- **December**:
- Total Number of Shares Purchased: 1,787,343
- Average Price Paid Per Share: $100.26
