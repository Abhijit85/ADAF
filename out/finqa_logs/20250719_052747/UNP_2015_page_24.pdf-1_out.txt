=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the ratio of the free cash flow to the cash provided by operating activities in 2015?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Components**:
   - Free Cash Flow in 2015: $524 million
   - Cash Provided by Operating Activities in 2015: $7344 million

2. **Calculate Ratio**:
   - Ratio = Free Cash Flow / Cash Provided by Operating Activities
   - Ratio = $524 / $7344

3. **Perform Calculation**:
   - Ratio = 0.07137 (rounded to five decimal places)

**Answer**: The ratio of the free cash flow to the cash provided by operating activities in 2015 is approximately 0.0714.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- **Free Cash Flow in 2015**: $524 million
- **Cash Provided by Operating Activities in 2015**: $7,344 million
- Free Cash Flow = $524 million
- Cash Provided by Operating Activities = $7,344 million
- Ratio = Free Cash Flow / Cash Provided by Operating Activities
- Ratio = $524 / $7,344
- Ratio = 0.07137 (rounded to five decimal places)
- The ratio of the free cash flow to the cash provided by operating activities in 2015 is approximately 0.0714.
- **Free Cash Flow in 2015**: $524 million
- **Cash Provided by Operating Activities in 2015**: $7,344 million
- Free Cash Flow = $524 million
- Cash Provided by Operating Activities = $7,344 million
- Ratio = Free Cash Flow / Cash Provided by Operating Activities
- Ratio = $524 / $7,344
- Ratio = 0.07137 (rounded to five decimal places)
- The ratio of the free cash flow to the cash provided by operating activities in 2015 is approximately 0.0714.
- Free Cash Flow = $524 million
- Cash Provided by Operating Activities = $7,344 million
- Ratio = $524 / $7,344 = 0.07137
