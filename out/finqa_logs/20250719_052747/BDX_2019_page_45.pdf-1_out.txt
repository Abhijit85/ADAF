=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In 2019, what was the percent of the financing structure that was based on equity?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Total Debt as a Percentage of Total Capital**: From the table, the total debt as a percentage of total capital in 2019 is 45.6%.
2. **Calculate Equity as a Percentage of Total Capital**:
   \[
   \text{Equity Percentage} = 100\% - \text{Total Debt Percentage}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Equity Percentage} = 100\% - 45.6\% = 54.4\%
   \]

**Answer**: 54.4%

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context. The table provided the total debt percentage, and the text confirmed the composition of total capital as debt and equity.

Answer Echoes:
- From the table, we know that in 2019, the total debt as a percentage of total capital is 45.6%.
- Since total capital is composed of both debt and equity, the percentage of total capital that is equity can be calculated as:
- Substitute the given value:
- **Arithmetic Type**: Percentage calculation
- **Data Requirements**: Total debt as a percentage of total capital
- **Context Needs**: Understanding of total capital composition (debt and equity)
- **Total Debt as a Percentage of Total Capital**: 45.6% (provided in the table data)
- **Understanding of Total Capital**: Total capital is composed of both debt and equity.
- **Equity as a Percentage of Total Capital**:
- Calculate equity percentage: \(100\% - 45.6\% = 54.4\%\)
