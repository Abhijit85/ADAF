=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What amount of long-term debt is due in the next 24 months as of December 31, 2003, in millions?

**Calculation**: 
Given the information provided, we are unable to perform a direct calculation due to the absence of specific numerical data on long-term debt maturities from both the table and the text. The text mentions certain bond maturities and a payment made in 2003, but without specific figures for the total debt due, we cannot calculate the exact amount.

**Answer**: Unable to calculate the exact amount of long-term debt due in the next 24 months as of December 31, 2003, due to missing specific maturity figures. Additional financial data is required.

**Source**: Combined analysis of table and text context.
