=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What percentage of future minimum lease commitments at December 31, 2006, for all operating leases that have a remaining term of more than one year are due in 2008?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Total Future Lease Commitments**:
   - Total future lease commitments = $1.1 billion

2. **Identify Lease Commitments Due in 2008**:
   - Lease commitments due in 2008 = $254 million

3. **Calculate the Percentage of Total Commitments Due in 2008**:
   - Percentage = (Lease commitments due in 2008 / Total future lease commitments) × 100
   - Percentage = ($254 million / $1100 million) × 100
   - Percentage = (254 / 1100) × 100 ≈ 23.09%

**Answer**: Approximately 23.09% of future minimum lease commitments at December 31, 2006, for all operating leases with a remaining term of more than one year are due in 2008.

Answer Echoes:
- Future minimum lease commitments at December 31, 2006, for all operating leases with a remaining term of more than one year are $1.1 billion.
- The specific breakdown of these commitments is as follows:
- $288 million in 2007
- $254 million in 2008
- $211 million in 2009
- $153 million in 2010
- $118 million in 2011
- $121 million in later years
- Total future lease commitments = $1.1 billion
- Lease commitments due in 2008 = $254 million
- Percentage = (Lease commitments due in 2008 / Total future lease commitments) × 100
- Percentage = ($254 million / $1,100 million) × 100
- Percentage = (254 / 1,100) × 100 ≈ 23.09%
- Total future lease commitments = $1.1 billion
- Lease commitments due in 2008 = $254 million
- Percentage = (254 / 1,100) × 100 ≈ 23.09%
