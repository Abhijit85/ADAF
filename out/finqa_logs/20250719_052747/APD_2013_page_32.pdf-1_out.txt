=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the percentual increase of other income due to favorable foreign exchange and reimbursements in 2011?

**Calculation**: 
To calculate the percentual increase, we need the base year value of other income (expense), net for 2011. The text provides that the increase in other income (expense), net was $5.4 million in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to favorable foreign exchange and reimbursements. However, the base year value for 2011 is not provided in the text or table data.

The percentual increase formula is:
\[
\text{Percentual Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Increase Amount}}{\text{Base Year Value}} \right) \times 100
\]

Given:
- Increase Amount = $5.4 million
- Base Year Value (2011 other income) = Not provided

Without the base year value, the percentual increase cannot be calculated.

**Answer**: The percentual increase of other income due to favorable foreign exchange and reimbursements in 2011 cannot be determined without the base year value for 2011 other income (expense), net.

**Source**: Combined analysis of text context (increase amount) and lack of specific table data for 2011 base year value.

Answer Echoes:
- In 2012 vs. 2011, other income (expense), net increased by $5.4 million.
- The increase was primarily due to favorable foreign exchange and reimbursements from government grants for expenses.
- The table data does not provide specific figures for other income, foreign exchange, or reimbursements for 2011.
- We need the value of other income (expense), net for 2011 to calculate the percentual increase. However, this value is not directly provided in the text or table.
- The percentual increase formula is:
- We know the increase amount is $5.4 million, but we lack the base year value (2011 other income).
- To calculate the percentual increase, we need the value of other income (expense), net for 2011. This information is not provided in the text or table data.
