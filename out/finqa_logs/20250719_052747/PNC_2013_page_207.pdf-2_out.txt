=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Was the notional amount of derivatives designated as hedging instruments under GAAP greater than the notional amount of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under GAAP?

**Calculation**:
1. Extract the relevant data from the table:
   - Notional amount of derivatives designated as hedging instruments under GAAP: $36197 million
   - Notional amount of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under GAAP: $345059 million

2. Perform the comparison:
   - Compare $36197 million (designated) with $345059 million (not designated).

3. Conclusion:
   - $36197 million is less than $345059 million.

**Answer**: No, the notional amount of derivatives designated as hedging instruments under GAAP ($36197 million) is not greater than the notional amount of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under GAAP ($345059 million).

**Source**: Table data.

Answer Echoes:
- **Notional amount of derivatives designated as hedging instruments under GAAP (2013)**: $36,197 million
- **Notional amount of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under GAAP (2013)**: $345,059 million
- **Designated as hedging instruments**: $36,197 million
- **Not designated as hedging instruments**: $345,059 million
- **Arithmetic Type**: Comparison
- **Data Requirements**: Notional amounts of derivatives designated and not designated as hedging instruments under GAAP.
- **Context Needs**: Understanding of what constitutes derivatives designated as hedging instruments under GAAP.
- **Notional amount of derivatives designated as hedging instruments under GAAP (2013)**: $36,197 million
- **Notional amount of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under GAAP (2013)**: $345,059 million
- **Definitions**: Derivatives designated as hedging instruments under GAAP are those used to manage interest rate risk and are recognized in the income statement in the same period the hedged items affect earnings.
- **Designated as hedging instruments**: $36,197 million
- **Not designated as hedging instruments**: $345,059 million
- Notional amount of derivatives designated as hedging instruments: $36,197 million
- Notional amount of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: $345,059 million
- Compare $36,197 million with $345,059 million.
