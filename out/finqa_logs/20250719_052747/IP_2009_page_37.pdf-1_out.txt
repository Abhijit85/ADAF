=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What percentage of consumer packaging sales in 2009 were North American consumer packaging net sales?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base**: Total consumer packaging sales in 2009 = $3.06 billion
2. **Identify Part**: North American consumer packaging net sales in 2009 = $2.2 billion
3. **Calculate Percentage**: 
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Base}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{2.2}{3.06}\right) \times 100
   \]
4. **Perform Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{2.2}{3.06}\right) \times 100 \approx 71.90\%
   \]

**Answer**: North American consumer packaging net sales were approximately 71.90% of total consumer packaging sales in 2009.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context and table data.

Answer Echoes:
- **Sales in 2009**: $3,060 million
- **Verify Numbers**: The table does not include North American consumer packaging net sales.
- **Check Units**: Units are consistent (millions).
- **Validate Calculations**: Calculation cannot proceed without the specific part value.
- **Format Properly**: Not applicable as calculation cannot be completed.
- **North American Consumer Packaging Net Sales in 2009**: $2.2 billion
- **Total Consumer Packaging Sales in 2009**: $3,060 million (or $3.06 billion)
