=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: How much of an increase, in millions, to the pension expenses did the three changes in assumption cause?

**Calculation**:
1. Extract the estimated increases from the table:
   - 0.5% decrease in discount rate: $23 million
   - 0.5% decrease in expected long-term return on assets: $18 million
   - 0.5% increase in compensation rate: $2 million

2. Sum the increases:
   \[
   23 + 18 + 2 = 43
   \]

**Answer**: The total increase to the pension expenses caused by the three changes in assumptions is **$43 million**.

**Source**: Combined analysis using table data for exact numbers and text context for understanding the assumptions.

Answer Echoes:
- .5% decrease in discount rate: $23 million
- .5% decrease in expected long-term return on assets: $18 million
- .5% increase in compensation rate: $2 million
- **0.5% decrease in discount rate**: $23 million
- **0.5% decrease in expected long-term return on assets**: $18 million
- **0.5% increase in compensation rate**: $2 million
- Add the estimated increases for each change in assumption:
