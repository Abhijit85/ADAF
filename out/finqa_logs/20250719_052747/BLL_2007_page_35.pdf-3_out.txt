=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the total amount of cash outflow used for shares repurchased during November 2007, in millions?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Number of Shares Purchased**: 
   - From October 29 to November 25, 2007, the total number of shares purchased was 431170.

2. **Identify the Average Price Paid per Share**: 
   - The average price paid per share during this period was $48.11.

3. **Calculate the Total Cash Outflow**:
   - Use the formula: Total Cash Outflow = Number of Shares × Average Price per Share
   - Total Cash Outflow = 431170 shares × $48.11/share

4. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - Total Cash Outflow = 431170 × 48.11 = $20742928.70

5. **Convert to Millions**:
   - Since the question asks for the amount in millions, divide the total cash outflow by 1000000.
   - Total Cash Outflow in Millions = $20742928.70 / 1000000 = $20.74 million

**Answer**: $20.74 million

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- From October 29 to November 25, 2007, the total number of shares purchased was 431,170.
- The average price paid per share during this period was $48.11.
- Multiply the total number of shares purchased by the average price paid per share to find the total cash outflow.
- Total Cash Outflow = Number of Shares × Average Price per Share
- Total Cash Outflow = 431,170 shares × $48.11/share
- Total Cash Outflow = 431,170 × 48.11 = $20,742,928.70
- Since the question asks for the amount in millions, divide the total cash outflow by 1,000,000.
- Total Cash Outflow in Millions = $20,742,928.70 / 1,000,000 = $20.74 million
- From the table data, it is stated that the total number of shares purchased from October 29 to November 25, 2007, was 431,170.
- The average price paid per share during this period was $48.11.
- Use the formula: Total Cash Outflow = Number of Shares × Average Price per Share
- Total Cash Outflow = 431,170 shares × $48.11/share
- Total Cash Outflow = 431,170 × 48.11 = $20,742,928.70
- Since the question asks for the amount in millions, divide the total cash outflow by 1,000,000.
- Total Cash Outflow in Millions = $20,742,928.70 / 1,000,000 = $20.74 million
- The calculation follows the standard arithmetic process for determining total expenditure based on unit price and quantity.
- The conversion to millions is correctly done by dividing by 1,000,000.
- Number of Shares: 431,170
- Average Price per Share: $48.11
- Total Cash Outflow = 431,170 × 48.11 = $20,742,928.70
- Total Cash Outflow in Millions = $20.74 million
