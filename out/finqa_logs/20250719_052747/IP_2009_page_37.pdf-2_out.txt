=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: North American consumer packaging net sales were what percentage of consumer packaging sales in 2008?

**Calculation**: 
To calculate the percentage of North American consumer packaging net sales relative to total consumer packaging sales in 2008, we need both figures. From the text context, we know:

- **North American Consumer Packaging Net Sales in 2008**: $2.5 billion

However, the total consumer packaging sales for 2008 is not provided in the text or table. Without this figure, we cannot perform the percentage calculation. The formula for the calculation, if the total sales were known, would be:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{North American Sales}}{\text{Total Consumer Packaging Sales}} \right) \times 100
\]

**Answer**: Additional context required. The total consumer packaging sales for 2008 are needed to calculate the percentage of North American consumer packaging net sales.

**Source**: Combined analysis (text context and assumed data requirement)

Answer Echoes:
- **North American Consumer Packaging Net Sales in 2008**: $2.5 billion
- **Total Consumer Packaging Sales in 2008**: This information is not directly provided in the text. However, we can infer that the total consumer packaging sales would include North American sales. Since the text does not provide a separate figure for total consumer packaging sales, we will assume that the North American sales are a significant portion of the total.
