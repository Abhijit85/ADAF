=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the interest amount in 2016 in millions, given a net interest reduction of 13 million or 23% compared to 2015?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Base Year (2015) Interest Amount**:
   - Let the interest amount in 2015 be denoted as \( I_{2015} \).

2. **Understand the Reduction**:
   - The interest amount in 2016 is 13 million less than in 2015.
   - This reduction represents 23% of the 2015 interest amount.

3. **Set Up the Equation**:
   - The reduction of 13 million is 23% of the 2015 interest amount:
     \[
     0.23 \times I_{2015} = 13
     \]

4. **Solve for \( I_{2015} \)**:
   \[
   I_{2015} = \frac{13}{0.23} = 56.52 \text{ million}
   \]

5. **Calculate the 2016 Interest Amount**:
   - The interest amount in 2016 is 13 million less than in 2015:
     \[
     I_{2016} = I_{2015} - 13 = 56.52 - 13 = 43.52 \text{ million}
     \]

**Answer**: The interest amount in 2016 was 43.52 million.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data and text context.

Answer Echoes:
- Let the interest amount in 2015 be denoted as \( I_{2015} \).
- The interest amount in 2016 is 13 million less than in 2015.
- This reduction represents 23% of the 2015 interest amount.
- The reduction of 13 million is 23% of the 2015 interest amount:
- The interest amount in 2016 is 13 million less than in 2015:
- \( I_{2015} = \frac{13}{0.23} = 56.52 \text{ million} \)
- \( I_{2016} = 56.52 - 13 = 43.52 \text{ million} \)
- **From Table**: The interest amount in 2015 is denoted as \( I_{2015} \).
- **From Text Context**: The interest amount in 2016 is 13 million less than in 2015, and this reduction represents 23% of the 2015 interest amount.
- Let the interest amount in 2015 be denoted as \( I_{2015} \).
- The interest amount in 2016 is 13 million less than in 2015.
- This reduction represents 23% of the 2015 interest amount.
- The reduction of 13 million is 23% of the 2015 interest amount:
- The interest amount in 2016 is 13 million less than in 2015:
