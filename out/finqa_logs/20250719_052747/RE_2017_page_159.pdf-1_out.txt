=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: At December 31, 2017, under the 2010 employee plan, what was the percent of shares that had been granted?

**Calculation**:
1. **Total Shares Authorized under 2010 Employee Plan**: 4000000 shares
2. **Remaining Shares Available as of December 31, 2017**: 2553473 shares

   - **Calculate Shares Granted**:
     \[
     \text{Shares Granted} = \text{Total Authorized Shares} - \text{Remaining Shares} = 4000000 - 2553473 = 1446527
     \]

   - **Calculate the Percentage of Shares Granted**:
     \[
     \text{Percentage Granted} = \left(\frac{\text{Shares Granted}}{\text{Total Authorized Shares}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{1446527}{4000000}\right) \times 100
     \]
     \[
     \text{Percentage Granted} = 36.16\%
     \]

**Answer**: As of December 31, 2017, 36.16% of the shares under the 2010 employee plan had been granted.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context.

Answer Echoes:
- From the text, we know that 4,000,000 common shares were authorized to be granted under the 2010 employee plan.
- The text states that there were 2,553,473 shares remaining available to be granted under the 2010 employee plan as of December 31, 2017.
- To find the number of shares that had been granted, subtract the remaining shares from the total authorized shares:
- To find the percentage of shares that had been granted, divide the number of shares granted by the total authorized shares and multiply by 100:
- Total Authorized Shares: 4,000,000
- Remaining Shares: 2,553,473
- Shares Granted = 4,000,000 - 2,553,473 = 1,446,527
- Percentage Granted = (1,446,527 / 4,000,000) × 100 = 36.16%
