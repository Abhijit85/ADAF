=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What percentage of the total purchase price is represented by intangible assets?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Value of Intangible Assets**: 
   - From the text, intangible assets acquired are valued at $8.5 million.

2. **Calculate the Total Purchase Price**:
   - Total Purchase Price = Cash Paid + Prior Investment in HPL + Acquisition-related Costs
   - Total Purchase Price = $11.0 million (cash) + $1.9 million (prior investment) + $2.8 million (acquisition-related costs) = $15.7 million

3. **Calculate the Percentage of Total Purchase Price Represented by Intangible Assets**:
   - Formula: \((\text{Intangible Assets} / \text{Total Purchase Price}) \times 100\)
   - Calculation: \((8.5 \, \text{million} / 15.7 \, \text{million}) \times 100 = 54.14\%\)

**Answer**: 54.14% of the total purchase price is represented by intangible assets.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context and table data.

Answer Echoes:
- **Cash Paid**: $11.0 million
- **Prior Investment in HPL**: $1.9 million
- **Acquisition-related Costs**: $2.8 million
- **Intangible Assets Acquired**: $8.5 million (consisting of $5.1 million in core developed technology, $3.2 million in customer relationships, and $0.2 million in backlog)
- The total purchase consideration is the sum of cash paid, prior investment, and acquisition-related costs.
- **Total Purchase Price** = $11.0 million (cash) + $1.9 million (prior investment) + $2.8 million (acquisition-related costs) = $15.7 million
- From the text, intangible assets acquired are valued at $8.5 million.
- Formula: \((\text{Intangible Assets} / \text{Total Purchase Price}) \times 100\)
- Calculation: \((8.5 \, \text{million} / 15.7 \, \text{million}) \times 100 = 54.14\%\)
- Intangible Assets = $8.5 million
- Total Purchase Price = $15.7 million
- \((8.5 / 15.7) \times 100 = 54.14\%\)
