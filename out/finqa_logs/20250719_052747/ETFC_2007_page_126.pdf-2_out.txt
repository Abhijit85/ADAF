=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: As of December 2007, what was the ratio of the future debt maturities for 2011 to the amounts after 2012?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify the Relevant Values**:
   - Future Debt Maturities for 2011: $453815
   - Future Debt Maturities for Amounts After 2012: $2996337

2. **Calculate the Ratio**:
   - Ratio = 2011 Debt Maturities / Thereafter Debt Maturities
   - Ratio = $453815 / $2996337

3. **Perform the Division**:
   - Ratio ≈ 0.1515 (rounded to four decimal places)

**Answer**: The ratio of the future debt maturities for 2011 to the amounts after 2012 is approximately 0.1515, meaning that the 2011 maturities are about 15.15% of the amounts due after 2012.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data.

Answer Echoes:
- Future debt maturities for 2011: $453,815
- Future debt maturities for amounts after 2012 (labeled as "Thereafter"): $2,996,337
- 2011 debt maturities: 453,815
- Thereafter debt maturities: 2,996,337
- Ratio = 2011 debt maturities / Thereafter debt maturities
- Ratio = 453,815 / 2,996,337
- Ratio ≈ 0.1515 (rounded to four decimal places)
- **Future Debt Maturities for 2011**: $453,815
- **Future Debt Maturities for Amounts After 2012**: $2,996,337
- 2011 Debt Maturities: $453,815
- Thereafter Debt Maturities: $2,996,337
- Ratio = 2011 Debt Maturities / Thereafter Debt Maturities
- Ratio = $453,815 / $2,996,337
- Ratio ≈ 0.1515 (rounded to four decimal places)
- 2011 Debt Maturities: $453,815
- Thereafter Debt Maturities: $2,996,337
- Ratio = $453,815 / $2,996,337 ≈ 0.1515
