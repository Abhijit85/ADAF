=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: At December 31, 2012, what was the percent of the total future minimum commitments under existing non-cancelable operating leases that was due in 2014?

**Calculation**:
1. **Identify Base**: Total future minimum commitments under existing non-cancelable operating leases.
   - From the table, the total lease obligations are:
     - 2013: $198 million
     - 2014: $136 million
     - 2015: $106 million
     - 2016: $70 million
     - 2017: $50 million
     - Thereafter: $141 million

2. **Calculate Total Lease Obligations**:
   - Total = $198 + $136 + $106 + $70 + $50 + $141
   - Total = $701 million

3. **Identify Part**: The portion of the lease obligations due in 2014.
   - 2014 Lease Obligations = $136 million

4. **Calculate Percentage**:
   - Percentage = (Part / Base) × 100
   - Percentage = ($136 million / $701 million) × 100
   - Percentage = (136 / 701) × 100 ≈ 19.40%

**Answer**: Approximately 19.40% of the total future minimum commitments under existing non-cancelable operating leases were due in 2014.

**Source**: Combined analysis from table data.

Answer Echoes:
- From the table, the total lease obligations are given as:
- 2013: $198 million
- 2014: $136 million
- 2015: $106 million
- 2016: $70 million
- 2017: $50 million
- Thereafter: $141 million
- Total = $198 + $136 + $106 + $70 + $50 + $141
- Total = $701 million
- 2014 Lease Obligations = $136 million
- Percentage = (Part / Base) × 100
- Percentage = ($136 million / $701 million) × 100
- Percentage = (136 / 701) × 100 ≈ 19.40%
- Total lease obligations are calculated as:
- Total = $198 + $136 + $106 + $70 + $50 + $141 = $701 million
- The portion of the lease obligations due in 2014 is $136 million.
- Percentage = (Part / Base) × 100
- Percentage = ($136 million / $701 million) × 100
- Percentage = (136 / 701) × 100 ≈ 19.40%
