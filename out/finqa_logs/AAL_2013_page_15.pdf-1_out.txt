=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis highlights the personnel distribution and potential regulatory impacts on American Airlines, US Airways, and their wholly-owned regional carriers as of December 31, 2013.

1. American Airlines leads in personnel numbers across all categories, with a total of 60100 employees, including 7900 pilots and 15000 flight attendants, nearly double those of US Airways.
2. Wholly-owned Regional Carriers exhibit an unusual staffing pattern, with more passenger service personnel (6400) than flight attendants (2100), and a relatively high number of passenger service personnel compared to their total personnel (18200).
3. Maintenance personnel numbers show a significant disparity, with American employing 11300, far exceeding US Airways' 3100 and the regional carriers' 2400.
4. Regulatory changes pose a risk of increasing operating costs and disrupting operations, with salaries, wages, and benefits already comprising 22% of operating expenses in 2013, underscoring the importance of labor relations and infrastructure maintenance.

Answer Echoes:
- [RATIO] American has the highest number of pilots at 7,900, which is nearly double that of US Airways at 4,100.
- [RATIO] Flight attendants at American (15,000) are almost twice those at US Airways (7,700).
- [ANOMALY] Wholly-owned Regional Carriers have more passenger service personnel (6,400) than flight attendants (2,100), which is unusual.
- [OUTLIER] American has significantly more maintenance personnel (11,300) compared to US Airways (3,100) and Wholly-owned Regional Carriers (2,400).
- [TREND] Across all categories, American consistently has the highest number of personnel, totaling 60,100.
- [RATIO] Fleet service personnel at US Airways (5,500) are more than three times those at Wholly-owned Regional Carriers (1,700).
- [ANOMALY] Wholly-owned Regional Carriers have a relatively high number of passenger service personnel (6,400) compared to their total personnel (18,200).
- [OUTLIER] Administrative and other personnel are equally distributed between American and US Airways, both at 5,500, despite the overall personnel difference.
- [DEFINITION] "Salaries, wages, and benefits" were 22% of operating expenses in 2013.
- [SCOPE] Focus on regulatory impacts and labor costs in the airline industry.
- [SOURCE] Information from a financial document, likely an annual report.
- [NOTE] Regulatory changes could "increase operating costs" and "disrupt operations".
- [WARNING] Potential "material adverse impact" on operations if facilities are inadequate.
