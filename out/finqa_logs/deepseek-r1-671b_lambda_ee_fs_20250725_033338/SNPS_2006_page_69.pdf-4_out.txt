=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what is the percentage of tax and accounting fees among the total acquisition-related costs?",
  "Calculation": "Insufficient data: $1.6M combines legal + tax + accounting fees (text context). Total acquisition costs = $2.8M (text). Percentage requires separating tax/accounting from legal fees, which is not provided.",
  "Answer": "Cannot calculate - insufficient fee breakdown",
  "Source": "combined"
}
