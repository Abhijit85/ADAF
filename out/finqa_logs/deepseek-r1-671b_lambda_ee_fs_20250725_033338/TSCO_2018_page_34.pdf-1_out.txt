=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "how much of a greater return , in percentage , was gained in the s&p retail index compared to the tractor supply company?",
  "Calculation": "Tractor Supply: ($117.18 - $100.00)/$100.00 × 100 = 17.18%\nS&P Retail: ($217.01 - $100.00)/$100.00 × 100 = 117.01%\nDifference: 117.01% - 17.18% = 99.83 percentage points",
  "Answer": "99.83%",
  "Source": "table"
}

Answer Echoes:
- Tractor Supply Company's return: ($117.18 - $100.00) / $100.00 × 100 = 17.18%
- S&P Retail Index's return: ($217.01 - $100.00) / $100.00 × 100 = 117.01%
- Difference in returns: 117.01% (S&P Retail) - 17.18% (Tractor) = 99.83 percentage points
