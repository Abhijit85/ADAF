=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what was the change in defined contribution plans expenses for the u.s . between 2015 and 2016 in millions?",
  "Calculation": "2016 Expense ($42.5M) - 2015 Expense ($40.2M) = $2.3M",
  "Answer": "$2.3 million",
  "Source": "text"
}

Answer Echoes:
- The provided table shows asset-related movements (gains, fair value changes, purchases/sales) for a plan as of December 31, **2017**, but it does **not** include data about defined contribution plan **expenses** for **2015 or 2016**.
- Expenses for defined contribution plans (employer contributions, administrative costs) are fundamentally different from asset value changes or investment gains/losses shown in the table.
- No values for 2015 or 2016 are provided in the table.
- Defined contribution plan expense figures for **2015** and **2016**.
- Any mention of "expenses" (not asset balances) in the table.
