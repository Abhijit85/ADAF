=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "in 2017 what was the percent of the common stock authorized that was issued and outstanding for the class a common stock",
  "Calculation": "(339235 / 1000000) × 100 = 33.9235%",
  "Answer": "33.92%",
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- The calculation matches the provided table data formula and precision standards
- Context confirms Class A shares exist separately from Class B
- No conflicting data about authorized share amounts was found in the text
