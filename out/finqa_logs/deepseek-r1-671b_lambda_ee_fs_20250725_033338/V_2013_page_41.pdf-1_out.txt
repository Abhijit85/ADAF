=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "for the quarter ended september 30 , 2013 what was the total number of shares purchased in august",
  "Calculation": "Direct extraction from August 2013 row: 6640567 shares (table value) [Note: Original answer shows 6640563 but correction needed based on table analysis]",
  "Answer": "6640567",
  "Source": "table"
}

Answer Echoes:
- No complex calculations are required. The value for August 2013 is directly stated in the table.
- The text clarifies that "3,022 shares of class A common stock" were withheld for tax obligations, but these are included in the total figures reported in the table. Since the question specifically asks for August 2013 (a distinct row), the provided value is standalone.
