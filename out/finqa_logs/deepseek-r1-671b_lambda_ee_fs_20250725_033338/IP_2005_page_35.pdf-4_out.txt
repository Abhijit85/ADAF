=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what was the percent of the total contractual obligations for future payments for total debt in 2005",
  "Calculation": "No calculation possible. Required data elements (2005 total contractual obligations and 2005 total debt) are unavailable in both table and text sources.",
  "Answer": "Cannot be determined - insufficient data",
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- Total contractual obligations for 2005 (including debt, leases, and purchase obligations).
- Total debt specifically included in the 2005 contractual obligations.
