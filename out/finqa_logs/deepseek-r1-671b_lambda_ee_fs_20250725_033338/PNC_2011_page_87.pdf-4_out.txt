=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "for 2013 , what was the total in millions of the combined interest only product and principal and interest product?",
  "Calculation": "1211 (Interest Only Product) + 331 (Principal and Interest Product) = 1542",
  "Answer": "$1542 million",
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- The calculation matches the explicit arithmetic provided in the table data.
- The context confirms the 2013 Form 10-K includes data as of December 31, 2011, aligning with the question’s reference to "for 2013."
- No discrepancies or additional context required.
