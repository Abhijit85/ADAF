=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "1. if the fuel surcharge grows by the same rate as in 2014 what would expected 2015 revenues be in billions?",
  "Calculation": "Insufficient data: Requires 2014 total revenue to calculate 2015 projection. While 2014 fuel surcharge ($2.8B) can grow 6% to $2.968B (2.8 * 1.06), total revenue components beyond fuel surcharge are unknown.",
  "Answer": "Insufficient data to calculate",
  "Source": "combined"
