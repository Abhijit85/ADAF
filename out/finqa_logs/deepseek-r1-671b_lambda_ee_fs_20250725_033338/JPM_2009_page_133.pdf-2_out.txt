=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "if there were a 100bp rise in rates , how much more would the impact be on earnings in 2009 vs . 2008?",
  "Calculation": "Difference = (-554 million 2009 impact) - (672 million 2008 impact) = -1226 million → Absolute value = 1226 million",
  "Answer": "$1226 million",
