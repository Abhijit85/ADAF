=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "in 2017 , what percentage of undeveloped acres were located in africa?",
  "Calculation": "(4444 Africa undeveloped acres / 4533 Global total acres) × 100 = (4444/4533) × 100 = 0.9804 × 100",
  "Answer": "98.04%",
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- The text confirms that most undeveloped acres in "Other Africa" (Ethiopia/Kenya) were sold in 2016, meaning the 2017 Africa total reflects post-sale acreage.
- The calculation matches the provided arithmetic and aligns with the temporal scope of the question.
