=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "for the three months ended march 2003 what were the total sales proceeds for subsidiaries assets in millions?",
  "Calculation": "495 (CILCORP/Medina Valley) + 59 (AES Ecogen/AES Mt. Stuart) + 30 (Mountainview) + 29 (Kelvin) = 495 + 59 + 30 + 29 = 613",
  "Answer": "$613M",
  "Source": "table"
}

Answer Echoes:
- Exact completion dates for each subsidiary sale (to verify if they fall within March 2003 or Q1 2003).
- Explicit confirmation that the listed sales in the table occurred during the three-month period ending March 2003.
