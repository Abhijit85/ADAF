=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what was the change in millions of weighted average common shares outstanding for diluted computations from 2016 to 2017?",
  "Calculation": "290.6 (2017) - 303.1 (2016) = -12.5",
  "Answer": "-12.5 million",
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- The financial context explicitly states that diluted earnings per share calculations include the dilutive effects of equity awards (RSUs, PSUs, stock options) and confirms no significant anti-dilutive impacts for 2016–2017.
- The table directly provides the weighted average shares for diluted computations in 2016 (303.1 million) and 2017 (290.6 million).
- The arithmetic difference (-12.5 million) reflects a decrease in shares year-over-year, consistent with the provided calculation.
