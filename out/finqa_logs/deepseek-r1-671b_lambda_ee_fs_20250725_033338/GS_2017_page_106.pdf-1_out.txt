=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "in millions , what was the change in the estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected between december 2017 and december 2016?",
  "Calculation": "35 million (Dec 2017) - 25 million (Dec 2016) = 10 million",
  "Answer": "$10 million",
  "Source": "text"
}

Answer Echoes:
- Breakdown of debt by measurement category
- Duration/risk exposure details
- Credit spread sensitivity disclosures
