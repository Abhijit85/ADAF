=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "how much was cost of good sold in 2009?",
  "Calculation": "1. Total gains = $158M (Ireland) + $232M (Gabon) = $390M\n2. Total losses = $154M (impairment) + $18M (pension) = $172M\n3. Net gains = $390M - $172M = $218M\n4. Pretax income formula: $80M = ($188M - COGS - OperatingExpenses) + $218M\n5. Solving: COGS + OperatingExpenses = $326M\n6. Unable to isolate COGS from operating expenses",
  "Answer": "Cannot be determined from provided data",
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- Revenues: $188 million
- Pretax income: $80 million
- Gross profit (Revenues - COGS)
- Explicit COGS or operating expense values
