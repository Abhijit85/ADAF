=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what is the ratio of the deffered tax assets for the state income tax credit carry-forwards to the net operating loss carry-forward",
  "Calculation": "16 million (state income tax credit) / 3 million (NOL) = 5.33:1",
  "Answer": "5.33:1",
  "Source": "text"
}

Answer Echoes:
- State income tax credit carry-forwards: $16 million
- NOL carry-forward: $3 million
