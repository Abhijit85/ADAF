=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "as of december 31 , what was percent of the capital markets goodwill to the total",
  "Calculation": "(142.4 / 1934.2) × 100 = 7.36%",
  "Answer": "7.36%",
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- The calculation matches the provided formula and aligns with the financial context, which confirms the Trading and Investing segment as the relevant scope.
- No goodwill is allocated to the Balance Sheet Management segment, so $1,934.2 million represents the total for the segment in question.
- Result is consistent with the annual impairment test date (December 31, 2011) referenced in the text.
