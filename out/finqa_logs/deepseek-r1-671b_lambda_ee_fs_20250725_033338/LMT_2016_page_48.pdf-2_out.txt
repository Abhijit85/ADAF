=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "in 2016 based on the increase in the net sales what was the ratio of the increasing factor to the offsetting factors that reduced sales",
  "Calculation": "Total Increasing Factors = $1700M (F-35) + $290M (C-130) + $250M (F-16) = $2240M | Total Offsetting Factors = $55M (C-5) | Ratio = $2240M รท $55M = 40.73:1",
  "Answer": "40.73:1",
