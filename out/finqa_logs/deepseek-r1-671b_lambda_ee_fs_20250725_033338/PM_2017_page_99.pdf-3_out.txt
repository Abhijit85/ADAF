=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what was the change in weighted-average shares for diluted eps from 2016 to 2017 , in millions?",
  "Calculation": "1553 (2017) - 1551 (2016) = 2",
  "Answer": "2 million",
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- The table explicitly lists the weighted-average shares for diluted EPS in 2016 and 2017.
- The financial context confirms that no antidilutive stock options existed in 2016 or 2017, meaning all dilutive securities were already factored into the diluted EPS calculations.
- The arithmetic difference between the two years’ values directly answers the question.
