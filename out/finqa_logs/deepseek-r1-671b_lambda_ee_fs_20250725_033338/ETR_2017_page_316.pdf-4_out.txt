=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "how much higher is net revenue in 2017 than 2016 ? ( in millions )",
  "Calculation": "$1522.6 million (2017) - $1520.5 million (2016) = $2.1 million",
  "Answer": "$2.1 million",
  "Source": "table"
}

Answer Echoes:
- The table provides direct values for both years.
- The text context explains *why* net revenue changed (e.g., rate adjustments, union power station purchase), but does not alter the arithmetic difference between the two stated values.
- Result matches the precomputed answer in the table and aligns with standard financial comparison logic.
