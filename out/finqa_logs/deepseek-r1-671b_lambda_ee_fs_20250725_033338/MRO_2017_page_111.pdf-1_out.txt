=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "for revisions of previous estimates , what was the impact in mmboe resulting from an increase in drilling programs in u.s . resource plays and an increase in discontinued operations due to technical reevaluation and lower royalty percentages related to lower realized prices?",
  "Calculation": "105 mmboe (U.S. drilling programs) + 67 mmboe (discontinued operations/royalty adjustments) = 172 mmboe",
  "Answer": "+172 mmboe",
  "Source": "combined"
}
