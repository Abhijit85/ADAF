=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what was the profit margin in 2015",
  "Calculation": "(Net Income 2015 / Net Revenues 2015) × 100 = ($231277 / $3967008) × 100 ≈ 5.83%",
  "Answer": "5.83%",
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- The calculation matches the table’s explicit formula and result.
- Text context confirms no material adjustments to 2015 financials (e.g., pro forma adjustments were excluded from the actual 2015 net income).
- Acquisition-related costs were already expensed in SG&A and reflected in the reported net income.
