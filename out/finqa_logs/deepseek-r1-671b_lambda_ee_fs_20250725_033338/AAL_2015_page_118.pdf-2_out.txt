=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what were total operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2013?",
  "Calculation": "Insufficient data to calculate. Required operating expenses = Revenue - Operating Income, but only Revenue ($40678M) and Net Income ($2526M) available. Total expenses = $40678M - $2526M = $38152M includes both operating and non-operating components which cannot be separated with provided information.",
  "Answer": "Cannot be determined from provided data",
  "Source": "table"
}

Answer Echoes:
- Total expenses (Revenue $40,678M - Net Income $2,526M = $38,152M) include **all** expenses (operating + interest + taxes + other non-operating costs).
- Isolating operating expenses requires explicit operating expense data or intermediate values not provided in the table or text context.
