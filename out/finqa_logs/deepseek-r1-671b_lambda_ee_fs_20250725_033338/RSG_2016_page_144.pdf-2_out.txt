=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what was the ratio of the aggregate fair values of our outstanding fuel hedges for 2015 and 2016",
  "Calculation": "2015 value / 2016 value = $37.8 million / $2.7 million = 14.0",
  "Answer": "14.0 (or 14:1)",
  "Source": "text"
}

Answer Echoes:
- 2015: $37.8 million
- 2016: $2.7 million
