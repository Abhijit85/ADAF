=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what is the percentage change in total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits from 2017 to 2018?",
  "Calculation": [
    "2017 Total: $3680 (prior year) + $24927 (current year) = $28607",
    "2018 Total: $16191 (prior year) + $60721 (current year) = $76912",
    "Difference: $76912 - $28607 = $48305",
    "Percentage Change: ($48305 / $28607) × 100 ≈ 168.8%"
  ],
  "Answer": "168.8%",
  "Source": "table"
}

Answer Echoes:
- 2017 Total Gross Increases: $3,680 (prior year) + $24,927 (current year) = $28,607
- 2018 Total Gross Increases: $16,191 (prior year) + $60,721 (current year) = $76,912
- Percentage Change: [(76,912 - 28,607) / 28,607] × 100 = (48,305 / 28,607) × 100 ≈ 168.8%
