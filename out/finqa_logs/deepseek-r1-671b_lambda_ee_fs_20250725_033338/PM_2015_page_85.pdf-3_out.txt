=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what is the interest expense in 2015 assuming that all the debt is interest bearing debt , ( in billions ) ?",
  "Calculation": "First note interest: $500M × 1.250% × (5/12) = $2.604M; Second note interest: $750M × 3.375% × (5/12) = $10.547M; Total = $2.604M + $10.547M = $13.151M; Convert to billions: $13.151M ÷ 1000 = $0.013151B",
  "Answer": "0.013 billion",
  "Source": "table"
}

Answer Echoes:
- First note interest for 5 months: $500 million × 1.250% × (5/12) = $2.604 million
- Second note interest for 5 months: $750 million × 3.375% × (5/12) = $10.547 million
- Total interest expense in 2015: $2.604M + $10.547M = $13.151 million
- Convert to billions: $13.151 million ÷ 1,000 = $0.013151 billion
- First note: $500M × 1.250% × (5/12) = $2.604M
- Second note: $750M × 3.375% × (5/12) = $10.547M
- Total = $2.604M + $10.547M = $13.151M
- Convert to billions: $13.151M ÷ 1,000 = **$0.013151B**
- Total Debt × Avg. Rate = $28.5B × 3.0% = **$0.855B**
