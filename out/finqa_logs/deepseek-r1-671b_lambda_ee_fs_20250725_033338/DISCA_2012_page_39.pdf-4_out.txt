=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what is the implied total value of the european sports satellite and cable network as of the transaction date?",
  "Calculation": "$264 million (20% equity purchase) ÷ 0.20 = $1320 million",
  "Answer": "$1.32 billion",
  "Source": "text"
}

Answer Echoes:
- The transaction implies that 20% of Eurosport's equity was valued at $264 million.
- To find the 100% implied value: $264 million ÷ 20% = $264 million ÷ 0.20 = $1,320 million.
