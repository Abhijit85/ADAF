=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "if there were 50 facilities being rated in 2009 , how many were bbb/baa?",
  "Calculation": "0.02 × 50 = 1",
  "Answer": "1",
  "Source": "table"
}

Answer Echoes:
- **Assumption**: The 2% in the table is used as the implied percentage for BBB/Baa-rated facilities (since no explicit data exists in the context).
- **Calculation**: \( 0.02 \times 50 = 1 \).
