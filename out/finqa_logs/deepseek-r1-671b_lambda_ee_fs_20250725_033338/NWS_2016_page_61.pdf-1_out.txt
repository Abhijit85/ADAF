=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what on the net interest reduction of 13 million or 23% ( 23 % ) compared to 2015 what was the interest amount in 2016 in millions",
  "Calculation": "Let I_2015 = 2015 interest. 23% decrease = $13M\n0.23 * I_2015 = 13 => I_2015 = 13/0.23 ≈ 56.52M\nI_2016 = 56.52M - 13M = 43.52M",
