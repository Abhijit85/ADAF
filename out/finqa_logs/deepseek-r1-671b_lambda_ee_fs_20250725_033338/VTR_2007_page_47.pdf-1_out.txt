=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "prior to the shares repurchased in 2007 , how many shares of common stock were outstanding?",
  "Calculation": "138311810 (post-repurchase shares as of Feb 15, 2008) + 14669 (Dec 2007 repurchased shares) = 138326479",
  "Answer": "138326479",
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- The number of shares outstanding **after** the repurchase, or
- The total shares outstanding **before** the repurchase (directly or via other data like total shares issued).
