=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "in 2010 what was the sum of the future minimum lease commitments due in 2014",
  "Calculation": "The table directly lists the 2014 future minimum lease commitment as $37660 (in thousands) under the 2010 column. No summation required as this represents the total commitment for 2014.",
  "Answer": "$37660",
  "Source": "table"
}

Answer Echoes:
- The table explicitly states the 2014 commitment is $37,660.
- No additional values from the text context (e.g., rental expenses, guarantees, or litigation) affect this figure, as they relate to other periods or obligations.
