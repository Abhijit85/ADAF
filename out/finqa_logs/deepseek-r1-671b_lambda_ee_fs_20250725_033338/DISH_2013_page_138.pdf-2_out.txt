=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what is the tax expense related to discontinued operations in 2012?",
  "Calculation": "Tax Expense = Pre-tax Loss - Net Loss After Tax = $62 million - $37 million = $25 million. Since the result reduces the loss, it represents a tax benefit recorded as negative tax expense",
  "Answer": "-$25 million",
