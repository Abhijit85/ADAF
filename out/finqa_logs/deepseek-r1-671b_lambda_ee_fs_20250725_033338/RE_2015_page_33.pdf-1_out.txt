=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what is the book to market ratio of the commercial mortgage-backed securities",
  "Calculation": "Book-to-Market Ratio = Book Value / Market Value = $264.9 million / $266.3 million = 0.9947",
  "Answer": "0.99",
  "Source": "text"
}

Answer Echoes:
- CMBS-specific unrealized gains/losses (to adjust book value to market value)
- Separate CMBS book vs. market value reporting
