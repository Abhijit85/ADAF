=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what is the net change in amount of statutory capital and surplus for bermuda subsidiaries in 2010?",
  "Calculation": "2010 Bermuda: $11798 million (combined) - $206 million (U.S. adjustment) = $11592 million; 2009 Bermuda: $9164 million (combined) - $215 million (U.S. adjustment) = $8949 million; Net change: $11592 million - $8949 million = $2643 million",
  "Answer": "$2643 million",
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- **2010**: $11,798 million (combined) - $206 million (U.S. adjustment) = **$11,592 million**
- **2009**: $9,164 million (combined) - $215 million (U.S. adjustment) = **$8,949 million**
- $11,592 million (2010 Bermuda) - $8,949 million (2009 Bermuda) = **$2,643 million**
