=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what are the annual other sinking fund requirements as a percentage of annual long-term debt maturities ( excluding lease obligations ) and annual cash sinking fund requirements for debt outstanding in 2007?",
  "Calculation": "Cannot calculate percentage - missing required components:\n1. Long-term debt maturities (ex-lease) in 2007\n2. Cash sinking fund requirements in 2007\nGiven: Other sinking fund requirements = $30.2M\nFormula: (30.2M / (Debt Maturities + Cash Sinking)) × 100",
  "Answer": "Insufficient data to calculate percentage",
  "Source": "text"
}

Answer Echoes:
- Annual long-term debt maturities (ex-leases)
- Annual cash sinking fund requirements
- Annual other sinking fund requirements
