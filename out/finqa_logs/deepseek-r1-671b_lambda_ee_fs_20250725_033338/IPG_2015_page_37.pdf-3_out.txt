=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what is the cash flow statement effect of the change in cash used for working capital from 2013 to 2014?",
  "Calculation": "(-131.1) - (-9.6) = -131.1 + 9.6 = -121.5",
  "Answer": "-$121.5 million",
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- **Operating Activities**: Reduced net cash provided by operating activities by $121.5 million (per the working capital increase).
- **Reported Impact**: Explicitly stated in the text as a key driver of the $76.6 million operating cash flow improvement (net income gains partially offset this working capital drag).
