=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what portion of the maximum exposure to loss from vies is related to guarantees in 2018?",
  "Calculation": "No 2018 guarantee amounts or total VIE exposure figures available in table or text context. Required formula: (Guarantees Amount 2018 / Total Maximum Exposure 2018) × 100. Missing both numerator and denominator values.",
  "Answer": "Unable to calculate - insufficient 2018 data",
  "Source": "combined"
}
