=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what is the total value of the options , warrants and rights that remain available for future issuance , ( in millions ) ?",
  "Calculation": "No calculation possible. Missing exercise price for 4446967 shares (Column C). Column B's $86.98 explicitly applies only to Column A (1442912 outstanding shares).",
  "Answer": "Unable to calculate",
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- The exercise price for the 4,446,967 unissued securities in Column C is not disclosed. Column B’s $86.98 explicitly applies only to the already-outstanding securities in Column A (1,442,912 shares). Future-issuance securities may have different pricing terms, which are not provided in the table or text context.
