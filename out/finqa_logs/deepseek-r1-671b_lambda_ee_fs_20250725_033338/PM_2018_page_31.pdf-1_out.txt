=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "By what percentage will the 2019 pre-tax pension and postretirement expense be higher than that of 2018?",
  "Calculation": "2018 Total Expense: 1.61% + 3.97% = 5.58%\n2019 Total Expense: (1.61% + 0.10%) + (3.97% + 0.18%) = 1.71% + 4.15% = 5.86%\nPercentage Increase: ((5.86% - 5.58%) / 5.58%) × 100 = (0.28% / 5.58%) × 100 ≈ 5.02%",
  "Answer": "5.02%",
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- 2018 Total Expense: 1.61% (Pension) + 3.97% (Postretirement) = 5.58%
- Projected 2019 Pension Rate: 1.61% + (1.61% - 1.51%) = 1.71%
- Projected 2019 Postretirement Rate: 3.97% + (3.97% - 3.79%) = 4.15%
- 2019 Total Expense: 1.71% + 4.15% = 5.86%
- Percentage Increase: [(5.86% - 5.58%) / 5.58%] × 100 = (0.28% / 5.58%) × 100 ≈ 5.02%
