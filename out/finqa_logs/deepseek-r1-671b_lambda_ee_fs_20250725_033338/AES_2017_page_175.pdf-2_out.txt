=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "for 2017 , what was net interest expense with related parties , in millions?",
  "Calculation": "Total net interest expense = $36M (total interest expense) - $8M (total interest income) = $28M. No data available to isolate related-party components.",
  "Answer": "Insufficient data",
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- Breakdown of interest expense/income specifically involving related parties (e.g., government-owned entities in Panama/Dominican Republic/Mexico/Chile)
- Explicit disclosure of intercompany interest transactions in the related party agreements
