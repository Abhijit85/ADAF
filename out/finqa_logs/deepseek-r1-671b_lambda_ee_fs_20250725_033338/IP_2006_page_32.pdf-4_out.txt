=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what was the consumer packaging profit margin in 2006",
  "Calculation": "Net Sales = $1500M + $396M + $670M = $2566M; Operating Profit = ($125M 2005 base + $10M net change) = $135M; Margin = ($135M ÷ $2566M) × 100 = 5.26%",
  "Answer": "5.3%",
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- Net positive factors: $9M + $33M + $18M + $25M = $85M.
- Net negative factors: $19M + $21M + $14M + $21M = $75M.
- Net change: $85M - $75M = **+$10M**.
- 2006 Profit = 2005 Profit + $10M = 1.08 × 2005 Profit → 2005 Profit = $125M.
- 2006 Profit = $125M + $10M = **$135M**.
