=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "in december 2011 what was the ratio of the receivables to the credit facility outstanding",
  "Calculation": "Undetermined: Requires receivables value (unknown) and credit facility ($50M). Table shows -$118415 (unconfirmed as receivables). Ratio = [Receivables]/50000000",
  "Answer": "Cannot be determined (insufficient data)",
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- The specific amount of *receivables* (not payables) from the money pool as of December 31, 2011. The table’s -$118,415 is ambiguous and not confirmed as receivables.
