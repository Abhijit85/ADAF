=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "at december 31 , 2010 what was the percent of the net allowance to the the carrying amount of the company 2019s purchased distressed loan portfolio",
  "Calculation": "(Allowance / Gross Carrying Amount) × 100 = ($77 million / $469 million) × 100 = 16.42%",
  "Answer": "16.42%",
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- The text explicitly states the gross carrying amount of $469 million (note 2) and the allowance of $77 million.
- The table’s precomputed result aligns with this calculation.
- The net carrying amount ($392 million) is not used here because the question refers to the relationship between the allowance and the total carrying amount of the portfolio (gross), consistent with standard financial reporting practices for loan loss coverage ratios.
