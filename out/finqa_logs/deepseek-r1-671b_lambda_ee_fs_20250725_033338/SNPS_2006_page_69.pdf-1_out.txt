=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what percentage of the total purchase price is represented by intangible assets?",
  "Calculation": "Total Purchase Price = $11.0M (cash) + $1.9M (prior investment) = $12.9M\nPercentage = ($8.5M / $12.9M) × 100 ≈ 65.89%",
  "Answer": "65.89%",
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- The $2.8 million in acquisition-related costs were excluded from the total purchase price, as these are typically expensed separately under accounting standards.
- The calculation aligns with the explicit financial data in the text, treating the prior investment as part of the total consideration for HPL.
