=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "as of december 31 2012 what was the percent of the total total freight revenues from agriculture",
  "Calculation": "(3280 / 19686) × 100 = 16.66%",
  "Answer": "16.66%",
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- The Mexico business revenue ($1.9 billion in 2012) is already included in the Total Freight Revenues figure per the text context, ensuring no double-counting or exclusion.
- The calculation aligns with the arithmetic and financial context provided.
