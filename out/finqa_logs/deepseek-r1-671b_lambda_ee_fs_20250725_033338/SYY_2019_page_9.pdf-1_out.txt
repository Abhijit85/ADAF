=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what was the change in the percentage of sales to restaurants from 2017 to 2018?",
  "Calculation": "62% (2018) - 61% (2017) = 1 percentage point",
  "Answer": "+1%",
  "Source": "table"
}

Answer Echoes:
- The table explicitly states the calculation for the change in percentage points between 2017 and 2018.
- The text context clarifies that "other" (a separate category) includes non-restaurant cafeterias and other entities, none of which exceeded 5% of total sales. This implies the primary "restaurant" category (not listed in "other") accounts for the majority of sales and aligns with the percentages in the table.
- No additional context is required, as the table directly answers the question.
