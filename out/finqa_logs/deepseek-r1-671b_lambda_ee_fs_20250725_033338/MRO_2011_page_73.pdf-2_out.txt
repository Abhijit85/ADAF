=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "how much was cost of good sold in 2009?",
  "Calculation": "No calculation possible. Insufficient data: Table shows revenues and pretax income from discontinued operations but no COGS or gross profit. Text context mentions gains/impairments but no operational revenue/expense details. COGS cannot be isolated from available information.",
  "Answer": "Cannot be determined",
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- Revenue from discontinued operations in 2009 (operational, not asset sale proceeds).
- Gross profit margin or explicit COGS figures for these businesses.
- Detailed income statement breakdowns showing COGS separately from other expenses.
