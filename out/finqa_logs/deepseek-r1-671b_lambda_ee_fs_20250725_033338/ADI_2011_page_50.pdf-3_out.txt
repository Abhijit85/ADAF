=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what would the amount accrued because of interest on the term loan facility after october 29 , 2011?",
  "Calculation": "1. LIBOR derivation: 2.42% (swapped notes rate) - 2.05% (swap spread) = 0.37%\n2. Interest rate: 0.37% LIBOR + 1.61% spread = 1.98% annually\n3. Annual interest: $145000000 × 1.98% = $2871000",
  "Answer": "$2.87 million",
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- This calculation assumes the interest is accrued annually. For shorter periods (e.g., quarterly/monthly), the amount would scale proportionally with time.
- The LIBOR rate of 0.37% is inferred from the swap agreement data, as the text explicitly states the total rate on the swapped notes (2.42%) includes LIBOR + 2.05%.
