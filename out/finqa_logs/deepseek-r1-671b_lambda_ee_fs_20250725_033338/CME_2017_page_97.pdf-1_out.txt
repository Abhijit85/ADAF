=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "how many class a common stocks issued and outstanding were issued between 2016 and 2017 in thousands?",
  "Calculation": "339235 (2017) - 338240 (2016) = 995",
  "Answer": 995,
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- The calculation aligns with the explicit table data.
- The financial context confirms class A common stock is separate from class B (which has distinct voting/transfer rules), and no preferred stock exists, leaving class A as the primary equity metric reflected in the table.
- Units are consistent (thousands).
