=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what was the average pension service cost from 2016 to 2018 in millions",
  "Calculation": "($136 million + $110 million + $81 million) / 3 = $327 million / 3 = $109 million",
  "Answer": "$109 million",
  "Source": "table"
}

Answer Echoes:
- The calculation matches the arithmetic in the provided table.
- The text context confirms the existence of pension cost components (including service cost) but does not explicitly list annual service cost figures. The table data is therefore assumed to represent these values.
