=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "for us federal purposes , how many years are currently involved in irs controversies?",
  "Calculation": "Interpret tax years as ranges: '1999 2013 2005' → 1999–2005 (7 years), '2006 2013 2008' → 2006–2008 (3 years). Total = 7 + 3 = 10 years",
  "Answer": "10",
  "Source": "text"
}

Answer Echoes:
- The phrase "tax years 1999 2013 2005" is assumed to represent a range of **1999–2005** (7 years: 1999, 2000, ..., 2005).
- The phrase "tax years 2006 2013 2008" is assumed to represent **2006–2008** (3 years: 2006, 2007, 2008).
