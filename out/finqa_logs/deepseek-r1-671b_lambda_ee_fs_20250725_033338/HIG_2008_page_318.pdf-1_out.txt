=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "In 2008 what was the percent of the total gaap stockholders 2019 equity and aggregate statutory capital associated with life operations",
  "Calculation": "Insufficient data: No breakdown of GAAP stockholders' equity ($9.3B) or statutory capital ($13.8B) by business segment (life operations vs. others) provided in available context. The $987M statutory surplus adjustment for life operations represents a partial component, not total statutory capital allocation.",
  "Answer": "Cannot determine - missing segment breakdowns",
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- Total GAAP stockholders’ equity ($9.3B)
- Total statutory capital ($13.8B)
- A $987M statutory surplus adjustment for life operations (not the full life operations statutory surplus)
