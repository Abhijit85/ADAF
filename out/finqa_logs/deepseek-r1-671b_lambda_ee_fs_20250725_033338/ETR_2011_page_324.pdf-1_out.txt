=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what amount of credit facility was paid by entergy louisiana prior to december 31 , 2011 , ( in millions ) ?",
  "Calculation": "$200 million (total credit facility) - $50 million (outstanding balance) = $150 million",
  "Answer": "$150 million",
  "Source": "text"
}

Answer Echoes:
- This assumes the full credit facility ($200 million) was drawn, and $150 million was repaid by December 31, 2011, leaving $50 million outstanding. While the text does not explicitly state repayments, this calculation aligns with standard financial reasoning for revolving credit facilities.
