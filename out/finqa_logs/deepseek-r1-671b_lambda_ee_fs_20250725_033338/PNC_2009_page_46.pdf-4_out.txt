=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what is the average percentage for aaa rated facilities in 2008 and 2009?",
  "Calculation": "(19% + 14%) / 2 = 33% / 2 = 16.5%",
  "Answer": "16.5%",
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- The financial context does not explicitly state that the 19% and 14% correspond to AAA-rated facilities. The text clarifies that most facilities are not explicitly rated but are structured to meet rating agency standards. This introduces ambiguity about whether the percentages in the table directly represent AAA ratings.
