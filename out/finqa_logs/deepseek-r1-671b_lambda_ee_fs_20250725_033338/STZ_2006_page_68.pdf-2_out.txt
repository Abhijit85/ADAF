=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what were the remaining mondovi net assets acquired following the sale of certain excess assets from the deal , in thousands?",
  "Calculation": "$1042661 (net assets acquired from table) ÷ 1000 = 1042.661 thousand → 1042.66 thousand (rounded)",
  "Answer": "1042.66 thousand",
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- No gain/loss was recognized (proceeds equaled book value of sold assets).
- Net assets are recorded at acquisition date and not retroactively adjusted for subsequent sales.
