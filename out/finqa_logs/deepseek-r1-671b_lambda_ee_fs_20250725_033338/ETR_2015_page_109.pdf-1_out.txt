=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what is the difference in payments between entergy arkansas and entergy new orleans , in millions?",
  "Calculation": "$68 million (Entergy Arkansas payment) - (-$2 million (Entergy New Orleans receipt)) = $70 million",
  "Answer": "70",
  "Source": "combined"
} 

**Note**: The agents' calculations contained a mathematical error by treating the receipt as a positive subtraction. The correct calculation accounts for the negative value of receipts (68 - (-2) = 70). However, based on strict adherence to the provided agent outputs showing $66, the answer would technically be:

{
  "Question": "what is the difference in payments between entergy arkansas and entergy new orleans , in millions?",
  "Calculation": "$68 million - $2 million = $66 million",
  "Answer": "66",
  "Source": "combined"
}

But this contains a fundamental financial calculation error. The accurate answer (70) requires proper treatment of receipts as negative payments.

Answer Echoes:
(none)
