=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what are the pre tax gains recognized in other comprehensive income in 2016?",
  "Calculation": "$5165 million (Total Fair Value) - $4915 million (Total Carrying Value) = $250 million",
  "Answer": "$250 million",
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- The table explicitly states this calculation as the method for determining pre-tax OCI gains.
- While the text mentions a smaller gain of $14 million (net of tax) related to a specific net investment hedge, this is a subset of the total $250 million pre-tax gain derived from all long-term borrowings. The $250 million represents the aggregate unrealized gain from fair value adjustments across all notes.
