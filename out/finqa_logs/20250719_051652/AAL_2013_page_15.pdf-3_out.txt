=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the ratio of the total flight attendants to passenger service personnel?

**Calculation**: 
1. Identify the total number of flight attendants and passenger service personnel from the table:
   - Total flight attendants = 24800
   - Total passenger service personnel = 22900

2. Calculate the ratio:
   - Ratio = Total flight attendants / Total passenger service personnel
   - Ratio = 24800 / 22900
   - Ratio = 1.0834 (rounded to four decimal places)

**Answer**: 1.0834

**Source**: Table data

This ratio indicates that for every passenger service personnel, there are approximately 1.0834 flight attendants.

Answer Echoes:
- We need to find the ratio of total flight attendants to passenger service personnel.
- Total flight attendants: 24,800
- Total passenger service personnel: 22,900
- Ratio = Total flight attendants / Total passenger service personnel
- Ratio = 24,800 / 22,900
- Ratio = 1.0834 (rounded to four decimal places)
- **Arithmetic Type**: Ratio
- **Data Requirements**: Total number of flight attendants and total number of passenger service personnel
- **Context Needs**: No additional context is required from the text for this specific calculation.
- **Exact Numbers**:
- Total flight attendants: 24,800
- Total passenger service personnel: 22,900
- **Staff Ratios**: We need to calculate the ratio of flight attendants to passenger service personnel.
- Total flight attendants = 24,800
- Total passenger service personnel = 22,900
- Ratio = Total flight attendants / Total passenger service personnel
- Ratio = 24,800 / 22,900
- Ratio = 1.0834 (rounded to four decimal places)
- Total flight attendants = 24,800
- Total passenger service personnel = 22,900
- Ratio = 24,800 / 22,900 = 1.0834
