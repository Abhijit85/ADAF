=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

- **What is the ratio of the total flight attendants to pilots?**
  - The TabuSynth output provides a specific ratio for US Airways, which is 1:1.88 (7700 flight attendants to 4100 pilots). However, it does not provide a total ratio for all airlines combined. Since Contextron did not provide a specific answer for this question, we use the TabuSynth's available data for US Airways as an example.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] American has the highest number of personnel across all categories, totaling 60,100.
- [RATIO] US Airways has fewer pilots (4,100) compared to flight attendants (7,700), a ratio of 1:1.88.
- [ANOMALY] Wholly-owned Regional Carriers have more passenger service personnel (6,400) than flight attendants (2,100), which is unusual for airlines.
- [OUTLIER] American employs significantly more flight attendants (15,000) compared to Wholly-owned Regional Carriers (2,100).
- [TREND] Total personnel for each category show that flight attendants (24,800) are the largest group, followed by maintenance personnel (16,800).
- [RATIO] The ratio of pilots to total personnel is lowest for Wholly-owned Regional Carriers (3,400 out of 18,200), approximately 1:5.35.
- [ANOMALY] Fleet service personnel numbers are relatively low across all segments, with a total of 14,600, compared to other categories like passenger service personnel (22,900).
- [DEFINITION] "Salaries, wages, and benefits" are major operating expenses, about 22% of total expenses.
- [SCOPE] Focuses on regulatory impacts and labor costs in the airline industry.
- [SOURCE] Information from "part i, item 1a. risk factors" and employee data as of December 31, 2013.
- [NOTE] Regulatory changes could "increase operating costs" and disrupt operations.
- [WARNING] Potential "material adverse impact" on operations if infrastructure needs aren't met.
