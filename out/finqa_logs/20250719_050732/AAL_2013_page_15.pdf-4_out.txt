=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

- **What portion of the total full-time employees of American are pilots?**  
  Unfortunately, the Contextron output does not provide a specific answer to this question, and the TabuSynth output does not directly address the portion of pilots among American's full-time employees. Therefore, based on the available data, we cannot determine the exact portion of pilots among American's full-time employees.

Answer Echoes:
- [RATIO] American has more than double the pilots compared to US Airways: 7,900 vs 4,100.
- [RATIO] Flight attendants at American are nearly double those at US Airways: 15,000 vs 7,700.
- [TREND] Maintenance personnel show a significant drop from American to US Airways: 11,300 → 3,100.
- [ANOMALY] Wholly-owned Regional Carriers have more passenger service personnel (6,400) than flight attendants (2,100).
- [OUTLIER] Passenger service personnel at Wholly-owned Regional Carriers (6,400) is unusually high compared to other categories within the same carrier.
- [TREND] Total personnel numbers show a decreasing trend from American (60,100) to US Airways (32,100) to Wholly-owned Regional Carriers (18,200).
- [RATIO] Fleet service personnel at US Airways (5,500) is significantly higher than at Wholly-owned Regional Carriers (1,700), despite having fewer total personnel.
- [DEFINITION] "Salaries, wages, and benefits" are a major operating expense, about 22% of total expenses.
- [SCOPE] Focuses on regulatory impacts, labor costs, and operational challenges for the airline industry.
- [SOURCE] Information likely from "part i, item 1a. risk factors" of a financial report.
- [NOTE] Regulatory changes could "increase operating costs" and affect "operations" and "route network."
- [WARNING] Potential "material adverse impact" on operations if infrastructure needs aren't met.
