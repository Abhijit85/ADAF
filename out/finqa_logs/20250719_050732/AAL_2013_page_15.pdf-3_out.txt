=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

- **What is the ratio of the total flight attendants to passenger service personnel?**  
  Since Contextron did not provide a specific answer for this question, we will use TabuSynth's analysis. According to TabuSynth, the number of flight attendants in American is 15000, and the number of passenger service personnel in Wholly-owned Regional Carriers is 6400. Therefore, the ratio of total flight attendants to passenger service personnel is 15000:6400, which simplifies to approximately 2.34:1.

Answer Echoes:
- [RATIO] Pilots to total personnel ratio is lowest for Wholly-owned Regional Carriers: 3,400/18,200 ≈ 18.7%
- [RATIO] Flight attendants make up the largest group in American: 15,000/60,100 ≈ 24.9%
- [TREND] American has consistently higher personnel numbers across all categories compared to US Airways and Wholly-owned Regional Carriers.
- [OUTLIER] Passenger service personnel in Wholly-owned Regional Carriers is unusually high compared to other categories: 6,400.
- [ANOMALY] Fleet service personnel in US Airways is significantly higher than in Wholly-owned Regional Carriers: 5,500 vs 1,700.
- [RATIO] Maintenance personnel in US Airways is a smaller proportion of total personnel compared to American: 3,100/32,100 ≈ 9.7% vs 11,300/60,100 ≈ 18.8%
- [TREND] Administrative and other personnel numbers are consistent between US Airways and Wholly-owned Regional Carriers: both have 5,500.
- [OUTLIER] Total personnel for American is almost double that of US Airways: 60,100 vs 32,100.
- [DEFINITION] "Salaries, wages, and benefits" are 22% of operating expenses.
- [SCOPE] Focus on regulatory impacts and labor costs in 2013.
- [SOURCE] Information from "part i, item 1a. risk factors".
- [NOTE] Regulatory actions could "increase operating costs" and affect operations.
- [WARNING] Potential "material adverse impact" on operations from inadequate facilities.
