=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

- **What is the ROI of an investment in S&P 500 Index from 2006 to January 3, 2009?**
  - The Contextron output does not provide a specific ROI figure for the S&P 500 Index from 2006 to January 3, 2009. However, it mentions that the data assumes an initial investment of $100 on December 30, 2006, with reinvested dividends. The TabuSynth output notes a significant drop in the S&P 500 Index from 104.24 in 2007 to 65.70 in 2009, indicating a decrease of approximately 37%. Therefore, the ROI for this period would be negative, reflecting this decline.
