=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

- **What is the ROI of an investment in Advance Auto Parts from 2006 to January 3, 2009?**  
  The Contextron output does not provide a specific ROI figure for the investment in Advance Auto Parts from 2006 to January 3, 2009. It mentions a comparison of cumulative total return starting from December 30, 2006, with an initial investment value of $100, but does not specify the ROI by January 3, 2009. Therefore, based on the available information, the specific ROI cannot be determined.
