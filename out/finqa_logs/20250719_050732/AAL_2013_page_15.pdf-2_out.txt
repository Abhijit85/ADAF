=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

- **What portion of the total full-time employees of American are flight attendants?**  
  The TabuSynth output indicates that American has 15000 flight attendants. However, the total number of full-time employees for American is not explicitly provided by Contextron. Therefore, based on the TabuSynth output, flight attendants are the largest group across all categories, totaling 24800, but this includes other airlines as well. Without a specific total number of full-time employees for American from Contextron, we cannot calculate the exact portion.

Answer Echoes:
- [RATIO] American has more than double the pilots of US Airways (7,900 vs. 4,100).
- [TREND] Flight attendants are the largest group across all categories, totaling 24,800.
- [ANOMALY] Wholly-owned Regional Carriers have more passenger service personnel (6,400) than flight attendants (2,100), which is unusual compared to other categories.
- [OUTLIER] American has significantly more maintenance personnel (11,300) compared to US Airways (3,100) and Wholly-owned Regional Carriers (2,400).
- [RATIO] The ratio of pilots to flight attendants for American is approximately 1:1.9 (7,900:15,000), whereas for US Airways, it is 1:1.88 (4,100:7,700).
- [TREND] Administrative and other personnel are consistently around 15% of the total for each airline (American: 8,200/60,100, US Airways: 5,500/32,100, Wholly-owned Regional Carriers: 2,200/18,200).
- [OUTLIER] Wholly-owned Regional Carriers have a notably high number of passenger service personnel (6,400) compared to their total personnel (18,200), making up about 35% of their workforce.
- [DEFINITION] "Salaries, wages, and benefits" are a major expense, 22% of operating expenses.
- [SCOPE] Focuses on regulatory impacts and labor costs in the airline industry.
- [SOURCE] Information from "part i, item 1a. risk factors".
- [NOTE] Regulatory changes could "increase operating costs" and affect operations.
- [WARNING] Potential "material adverse impact" on operations if facilities are inadequate.
