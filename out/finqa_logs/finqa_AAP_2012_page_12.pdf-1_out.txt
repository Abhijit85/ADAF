=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The data shows a consistent increase in the number of stores from 2008 to 2012, with more stores opening than closing in 2010 and 2011. 
1. The number of beginning stores rose annually from 3153 in 2008 to 3460 in 2012, indicating a steady expansion of the store network over this period.
2. Similarly, the number of ending stores also saw an annual increase, from 3243 in 2008 to 3576 in 2012, further confirming the growth trend.
3. An anomaly was observed in 2010 and 2011, where the number of stores closed was negative. This suggests that more stores were opened than closed in these years, contributing to the overall growth.
4. The number of new stores opened each year fluctuated, with a peak of 116 in 2012 and a trough of 75 in 2009. Despite this variation, the overall trend was towards an increase in the number of stores.
The context does not provide specific information about the growth rate in the number of stores during 2012 or details about the company's store-based information systems, inventory management, and purchasing strategies.
