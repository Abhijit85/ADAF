=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The value of Advance Auto Parts significantly outperformed both the S&P 500 Index and the S&P Retail Index from 2006 to 2011. 
1. Advance Auto Parts saw a substantial increase in value, more than doubling from $100.00 in 2006 to $201.18 in 2011. 
2. In contrast, the S&P 500 Index experienced a decrease in value from 100.00 in 2006 to 65.70 in 2009, before recovering slightly to 88.67 in 2011. This value was still less than half of the Advance Auto Parts value in the same year.
3. The S&P Retail Index followed a similar trend to the S&P 500, dropping to 58.29 in 2009 and then increasing to 104.81 in 2011, which was still lower than the 2006 value.
4. An anomaly was observed in the S&P 500 Index value, which remained the same (88.67) in 2010 and 2011. 
5. The initial investment in Advance Auto Parts on December 30, 2006, was "$100", and by January 3, the value had slightly decreased to "$97.26". The context does not specify the year for this date, but it is assumed to be 2009 based on the question's request for the ROI until January 3, 2009.
