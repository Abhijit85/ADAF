=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

## SYNTHESIS FOR RATIO CALCULATION

### Question: 
What is the ratio of the total flight attendants to pilots?

### Calculation: 
To find the ratio of the total flight attendants to pilots, we need to extract the values from the table and divide the total number of flight attendants by the total number of pilots.

**Data Extraction**: From the table data, we have the total number of flight attendants as 24800 and the total number of pilots as 15400.

**Step 1: Extract Numbers**
- Value1: 24800 (total flight attendants)
- Value2: 15400 (total pilots)

**Step 2: Calculate Ratio**
- Ratio = Value1 / Value2 = 24800 / 15400

**Step 3: Format Result**
- Ratio = 1.61

### Answer: 
The ratio of the total flight attendants to the total pilots is 1.61.

### Source: 
Table and text analysis combined.

Answer Echoes:
- Total flight attendants = 24,800
- Total pilots = 15,400
- Value1: 24,800 (total flight attendants)
- Value2: 15,400 (total pilots)
- Ratio = Value1 / Value2 = 24,800 / 15,400
- Ratio = 1.61
