=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "as of december 31 , 2017 , assuming an average price per share of $ 12.12 , what would be the cost in millions to repurchase all the remaining shares remaining in the program?",
  "Calculation": "The cost to repurchase all remaining shares is directly given by the amount remaining available for repurchase under the program. Number of shares remaining = $246 million / $12.12 = 20297029 shares. Thus, the cost = $246 million.",
  "Answer": "246",
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- The average price per share for repurchases under the program is $12.12.
- As of December 31, 2017, $246 million remained available for repurchase under the program.
