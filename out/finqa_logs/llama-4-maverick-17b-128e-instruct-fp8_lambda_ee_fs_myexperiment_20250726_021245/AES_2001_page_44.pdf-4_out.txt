=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

To synthesize the best financial answer for the question "1. contract generation revenues were what in millions in 2001?", we need to analyze both the table data and the text context provided.

### Step 1: Evaluate Available Information
- **Table Data**: The TabuSynth Analysis directly extracts the contract generation revenue for 2001 as $827 million.
- **Text Context**: The Contextron Analysis provides additional context that the $827 million represents the gross margin, which is 33% of the revenues.

### Step 2: Determine the Correct Calculation
- The question asks for "contract generation revenues," not the gross margin. 
- The gross margin percentage is given as 33% in 2001.
- To find the revenues, we need to divide the gross margin by the gross margin percentage.

### Step 3: Perform the Calculation
Given:
- Gross Margin = $827 million
- Gross Margin Percentage = 33% or 0.33

\[ \text{Revenues} = \frac{\text{Gross Margin}}{\text{Gross Margin Percentage}} = \frac{827}{0.33} \]

\[ \text{Revenues} = 2506.06 \, \text{million} \]

Rounded to the nearest million, the revenues are approximately $2506 million.

### Step 4: Synthesize the Answer
The most accurate answer comes from the Contextron Analysis, which correctly interprets the gross margin and its percentage to calculate the total revenues.
