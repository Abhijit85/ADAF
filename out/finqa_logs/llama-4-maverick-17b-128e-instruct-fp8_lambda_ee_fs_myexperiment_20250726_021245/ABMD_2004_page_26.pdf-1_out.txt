=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "for the facility leases that have remaining terms through fiscal 2010 , assuming the annual rent is approximately that of 2003 , what is the remaining total obligation?",
  "Calculation": "$3870 (total payments from 2005 to 2009) + $774 (estimated payment for 2010) = $4644",
  "Answer": "$4644",
  "Source": "Combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- 2005: $781
- 2006: $776
- 2007: $769
- 2008: $772
- 2009: $772
- Thereafter: $708
- Total future minimum lease payments: $4,578
- Total committed through 2009: $3,870
- Estimated payment for 2010: $774 (using the average of previous years as a proxy)
- The "Thereafter" ($708) is the total for years after 2009. If we assume the lease payment remains consistent, we should directly consider the given total and the years provided.
- Total future minimum lease payments: $4,578
- Since the average annual payment is about $774, and "Thereafter" is $708, we can infer that the payment for the years after 2009 is less than the average annual payment, suggesting that 2010 is likely the last year of significant lease obligation.
- 2005: $781
