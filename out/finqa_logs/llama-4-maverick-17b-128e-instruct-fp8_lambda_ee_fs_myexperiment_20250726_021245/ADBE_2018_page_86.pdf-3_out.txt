=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what is the percentage change in total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits from 2016 to 2017?",
  "Calculation": "The calculation cannot be performed due to missing data for 2016.",
  "Answer": "Unable to calculate",
  "Source": "Combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- For 2018: Gross increases in unrecognized tax benefits – prior year tax positions = $16,191, Gross increases in unrecognized tax benefits – current year tax positions = $60,721.
- For 2017: Gross increases in unrecognized tax benefits – prior year tax positions = $3,680, Gross increases in unrecognized tax benefits – current year tax positions = $24,927.
- For 2018: Total gross increases = $16,191 + $60,721 = $76,912.
- For 2017: Total gross increases = $3,680 + $24,927 = $28,607.
- New Value (2018) = $76,912.
- Old Value (2017) = $28,607.
- Percentage change = (($76,912 - $28,607) / $28,607) * 100.
