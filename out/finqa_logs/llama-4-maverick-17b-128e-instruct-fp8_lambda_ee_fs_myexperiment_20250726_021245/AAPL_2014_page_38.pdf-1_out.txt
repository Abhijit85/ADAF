=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "1. in what year was the cash cash equivalents and marketable securities the highest?",
  "Calculation": "Comparing the values for 'Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities' across 2012, 2013, and 2014: $121251 (2012) < $146761 (2013) < $155239 (2014)",
  "Answer": "2014",
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- For 2012: $121,251
- For 2013: $146,761
- For 2014: $155,239
- $121,251 (2012) vs. $146,761 (2013) vs. $155,239 (2014)
- $121,251 (2012) vs. $146,761 (2013) vs. $155,239 (2014)
