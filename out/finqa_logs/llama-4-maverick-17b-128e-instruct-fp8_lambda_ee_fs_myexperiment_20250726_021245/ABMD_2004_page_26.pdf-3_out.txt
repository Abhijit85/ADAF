=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what percentage of total future minimum lease payments are due after 2009?",
  "Calculation": "($708 / $4578) × 100 = 15.46%",
  "Answer": "15.46%",
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- Total future minimum lease payments = $4,578
- Payments due by 2009 = $781 (2005) + $776 (2006) + $769 (2007) + $772 (2008) + $772 (2009)
- Payment due thereafter = $708
- Total due by 2009 = $781 + $776 + $769 + $772 + $772 = $3,870
- Total due after 2009 = Total future minimum lease payments - Total due by 2009
- Total due after 2009 = $4,578 - $3,870 = $708
- Percentage = (Total due after 2009 / Total future minimum lease payments) × 100
- Percentage = ($708 / $4,578) × 100
- Percentage = ($708 / $4,578) × 100 = 0.1546 × 100 = 15.46%
