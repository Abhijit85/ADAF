=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what would the amount accrued because of interest on the term loan facility after october 29, 2011?",
  "Calculation": "Principal (P) = $145000000, Interest Rate (R) = 1.61% or 0.0161 as decimal. Interest = P * R = $145000000 * 0.0161 = $2334500",
  "Answer": "$2334500",
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- The term loan facility is $145 million.
- The interest rate is based on LIBOR plus a spread of 1.25%.
- As of October 29, 2011, the interest rate was 1.61%.
- Principal (P) = $145 million
- Interest Rate (R) = 1.61% (as of October 29, 2011)
- Principal Amount = $145 million
- Interest Rate as of October 29, 2011 = 1.61%
