=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what is the percentage change in total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits from 2017 to 2018?",
  "Calculation": "((76912 - 28607) / 28607) * 100 = 168.87%",
  "Answer": "168.87%",
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- For 2018:
- Gross increases in unrecognized tax benefits – prior year tax positions: $16,191
- Gross decreases in unrecognized tax benefits – prior year tax positions: -$4,000
- Gross increases in unrecognized tax benefits – current year tax positions: $60,721
- For 2017:
- Gross increases in unrecognized tax benefits – prior year tax positions: $3,680
- Gross decreases in unrecognized tax benefits – prior year tax positions: -$30,166
- Gross increases in unrecognized tax benefits – current year tax positions: $24,927
- For 2018: Total gross increase = $16,191 (increase prior year) + $60,721 (increase current year) = $76,912; Total gross decrease = $4,000 (decrease prior year)
- For 2017: Total gross increase = $3,680 (increase prior year) + $24,927 (increase current year) = $28,607; Total gross decrease = $30,166 (decrease prior year)
- For 2018: Net change = $76,912 (total gross increases) - $4,000 (total gross decrease) = $72,912
- For 2017: Net change = $28,607 (total gross increases) - $30,166 (total gross decrease) = -$1,559
- For 2018: Total gross amount = $16,191 + $60,721 = $76,912
- For 2017: Total gross amount = $3,680 + $24,927 = $28,607
- Gross increases in unrecognized tax benefits – prior year tax positions: $16,191
- Gross decreases in unrecognized tax benefits – prior year tax positions: -$4,000
- Gross increases in unrecognized tax benefits – current year tax positions: $60,721
- Gross increases in unrecognized tax benefits – prior year tax positions: $3,680
- Gross decreases in unrecognized tax benefits – prior year tax positions: -$30,166
- Gross increases in unrecognized tax benefits – current year tax positions: $24,927
