=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "for fiscal 2018, what percentage of the total change in the valuation allowance was due to settlements with taxing authorities?",
  "Calculation": "($0 / ($196152 - $172945)) × 100 = 0%",
  "Answer": "0%",
  "Source": "Combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- The total change in unrecognized tax benefits is the difference between the ending balance and the beginning balance for 2018.
- The settlements with taxing authorities for 2018.
- Beginning balance for 2018: $172,945
- Ending balance for 2018: $196,152
- Settlements with taxing authorities for 2018: $0 (since it's mentioned as '—')
- The total change in the valuation allowance for fiscal 2018 was $80.9 million.
- The context discusses unrecognized tax benefits and their changes, but it does not directly link to the valuation allowance changes due to settlements with taxing authorities.
- The beginning balance of unrecognized tax benefits for 2018 was $172,945 (in thousands).
- The ending balance for 2018 was $196,152 (in thousands).
- Settlements with taxing authorities for 2018 were $0 (since it's mentioned as '—').
