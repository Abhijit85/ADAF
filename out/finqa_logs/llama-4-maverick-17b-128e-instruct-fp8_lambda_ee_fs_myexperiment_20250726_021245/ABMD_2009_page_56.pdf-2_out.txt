=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what portion of contractual obligations is expected to be paid within 12 months?",
  "Calculation": "(4619 / 9457) × 100 = 48.85%",
  "Answer": "48.85%",
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- Total Contractual Obligations = $9,457 (from the "Contractual Obligations (1)" row, "Total" column)
- Amount due in Less than 1 Year = $4,619 (from the "Contractual Obligations (1)" row, "Less than 1 Year" column)
- Total Contractual Obligations = $9,457 (from the "Contractual Obligations (1)" row, "Total" column)
- Amount due in Less than 1 Year = $4,619 (from the "Contractual Obligations (1)" row, "Less than 1 Year" column)
