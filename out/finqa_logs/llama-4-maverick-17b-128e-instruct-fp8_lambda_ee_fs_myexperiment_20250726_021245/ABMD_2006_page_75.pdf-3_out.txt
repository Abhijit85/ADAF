=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what percentage of total future minimum lease payments are due in 2008?",
  "Calculation": "(1371 / 4819) * 100 = 28.45%",
  "Answer": "28.45%",
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
- Total future minimum lease payments = $4,819
- Lease payment due in 2008 = $1,371
- Part = $1,371 (lease payment due in 2008)
- Base = $4,819 (total future minimum lease payments)
- Total future minimum lease payments = $4,819 (in thousands)
- Lease payment due in 2008 = $1,371 (in thousands)
- Part = $1,371 (lease payment due in 2008)
- Base = $4,819 (total future minimum lease payments)
