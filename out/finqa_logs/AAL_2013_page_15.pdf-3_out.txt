=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial document provides a detailed analysis of employment figures and regulatory risks impacting the airline industry, with a focus on American and US Airways.

1. American Airlines employs the highest number of pilots at 7900, nearly double the 4100 pilots at US Airways, highlighting its larger operational scale.
2. Flight attendants at American total 15000, almost twice the 7700 at US Airways, reflecting a similar trend in workforce size across different roles.
3. An anomaly is observed in Wholly-owned Regional Carriers, where passenger service personnel (6400) outnumber flight attendants (2100), which is unusual compared to other categories.
4. Maintenance personnel at American (11300) significantly exceed those at US Airways (3100) and Wholly-owned Regional Carriers (2400), indicating a substantial investment in aircraft upkeep.

Answer Echoes:
- [RATIO] American has the highest number of pilots at 7,900, which is nearly double US Airways' 4,100.
- [RATIO] Flight attendants at American (15,000) are almost twice as many as those at US Airways (7,700).
- [ANOMALY] Wholly-owned Regional Carriers have more passenger service personnel (6,400) than flight attendants (2,100), which is unusual compared to other categories.
- [OUTLIER] Maintenance personnel at American (11,300) significantly outnumber those at US Airways (3,100) and Wholly-owned Regional Carriers (2,400).
- [TREND] Total personnel for American (60,100) is almost double that of US Airways (32,100).
- [RATIO] Fleet service personnel at US Airways (5,500) are more than three times those at Wholly-owned Regional Carriers (1,700).
- [TREND] Administrative and other personnel are evenly distributed between American (8,200) and US Airways (5,500), with Wholly-owned Regional Carriers having the least (2,200).
- [DEFINITION] "Salaries, wages, and benefits" were 22% of operating expenses in 2013.
- [SCOPE] Focus on regulatory impacts and labor costs in the airline industry.
- [SOURCE] Information from Part I, Item 1A, and employment data as of December 31, 2013.
- [NOTE] Regulatory changes could increase costs and disrupt operations.
- [WARNING] Potential for "material adverse impact" on operations if infrastructure is inadequate.
