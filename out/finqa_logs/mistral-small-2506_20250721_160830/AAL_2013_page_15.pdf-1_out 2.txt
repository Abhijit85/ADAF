=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the ratio of the total flight attendants to pilots?

**Calculation**:
1. Total number of flight attendants = 24800
2. Total number of pilots = 15400
3. Ratio = Total flight attendants / Total pilots
4. Ratio = 24800 / 15400 ≈ 1.61

**Answer**: The ratio of total flight attendants to pilots is **1.61**.

**Source**: Table data (exact numbers provided in the table).

**Validation**:
- The calculation is mathematically correct (24800 ÷ 15400 = 1.61).
- The numbers are directly extracted from the table, ensuring reliability.
- The result is reasonable, as the ratio indicates there are approximately 1.61 flight attendants per pilot, which aligns with typical airline staffing ratios.

**Additional Notes**:
- No additional context from the text was required for this calculation, as the question only needed the ratio based on the provided table data.
- The answer is presented with proper formatting and includes all calculation steps for transparency.
