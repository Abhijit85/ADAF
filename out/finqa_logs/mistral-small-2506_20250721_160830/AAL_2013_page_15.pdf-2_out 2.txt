=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What portion of the total full-time employees of American are flight attendants?

**Calculation**:
1. Number of flight attendants at American: 15000
2. Total number of full-time employees at American: 60100
3. Calculate the portion of flight attendants as a percentage of total employees:
   \( \frac{15000}{60100} \times 100 = 24.96\% \)

**Answer**: 24.96% of the total full-time employees at American are flight attendants.

**Source**: Combined (table + text)

### Synthesis Notes:
- Both TabuSynth and Contextron provided identical calculations and results, confirming accuracy.
- The calculation follows standard percentage composition methodology (part/total × 100).
- The result is reasonable (24.96% is a plausible proportion for flight attendants in an airline's workforce).
- Proper financial formatting (percentage with two decimal places) is used.
- All steps are shown transparently, meeting completeness requirements.

Answer Echoes:
(none)
