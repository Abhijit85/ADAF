=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What portion of the total full-time employees of American are pilots?

**Calculation**:
1. Number of pilots at American: 7900
2. Total number of full-time employees at American: 60100
3. Calculate the portion of pilots as a percentage of total employees:
   \( \frac{7900}{60100} \times 100 = 13.14\% \)

**Answer**: 13.14% of the total full-time employees of American are pilots.

**Source**: Combined (table + text)

### Synthesis Notes:
- Both TabuSynth and Contextron provided identical calculations and results, confirming consistency.
- The calculation is mathematically correct and logically sound.
- The answer includes the full calculation steps and proper financial formatting (percentage).
- No additional context from text was needed beyond the numerical data.

Answer Echoes:
(none)
