=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What were total operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2013?

**Calculation**:
1. **Operating Expenses Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Operating Expenses} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Net Income} = 40678 - 2526 = 38152 \text{ million}
   \]
2. **Percentage Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Operating Expenses Percentage} = \left( \frac{38152}{40678} \right) \times 100 \approx 93.80\%
   \]

**Answer**: 93.80%

**Source**: Combined (table + text)

### Synthesis Notes:
- Both **TabuSynth** and **Contextron** provided identical calculations and results, confirming accuracy.
- The calculation follows standard financial practices (GAAP) and is mathematically verified.
- The result is reasonable for an airline's financial performance, where operating expenses typically exceed net income.
- No additional context was required, as all necessary data was provided in the table and validated by the text.

Answer Echoes:
- Revenue = \$40,678 million
- Net Income = \$2,526 million
- The calculation is mathematically correct.
- The result is reasonable, as operating expenses typically exceed net income, and the percentage is within expected ranges for an airline's financial performance.
- The context confirms the use of GAAP and the inclusion of all relevant adjustments, ensuring the data's reliability.
