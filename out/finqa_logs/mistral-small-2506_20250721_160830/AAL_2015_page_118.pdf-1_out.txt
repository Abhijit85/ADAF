=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the net profit margin on December 31, 2013?

**Calculation**:
Net Profit Margin = (Net Income / Revenue) × 100
= (2526 / 40678) × 100
≈ 6.21%

**Answer**: 6.21%

**Source**: Table (primary) + Text (contextual validation)

### Synthesis Notes:
1. **Mathematical Accuracy**: Both analyses correctly applied the formula and performed the division/multiplication steps.
2. **Data Reliability**: The table provided the exact figures (Net Income = $2526M, Revenue = $40678M), which were correctly extracted.
3. **Contextual Validation**: The text confirmed the period (Dec 9–31, 2013) and clarified that additional context (e.g., loyalty program liability) was irrelevant to this calculation.
4. **Precision**: The result is rounded to two decimal places, standard for financial margins.
5. **Final Decision**: The table-based calculation (6.21%) is preferred as it directly uses the exact numbers, while the text analysis provided confirmatory context.

No adjustments or corrections were needed. The answer is mathematically sound and contextually validated.
