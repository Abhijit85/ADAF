=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

American has the highest total personnel count among airlines, followed by US Airways, with wholly-owned regional carriers having the least. 
1. American leads in personnel numbers with a total of 60100 employees, significantly higher than US Airways' 32100 and the 18200 of wholly-owned regional carriers.
2. The ratio of pilots to flight attendants is approximately 1:2 for both American and US Airways, while it is 1:1 for wholly-owned regional carriers. This indicates a higher demand for flight attendants in larger airlines.
3. An anomaly observed is that all three entities have more passenger service personnel than pilots, suggesting a greater emphasis on customer service roles.
4. American has a significantly higher number of maintenance personnel (11300) compared to US Airways (3100) and wholly-owned regional carriers (2400), indicating a potential outlier in its operational structure.
5. Salaries, wages, and benefits accounted for about 22% of operating expenses in 2013, but the distribution of these costs across different roles is not specified.
