=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what are the pre tax gains recognized in other comprehensive income in 2016?",
  "Calculation": "The text explicitly states the pre-tax gain recognized in other comprehensive income for 2016 was $14 million (net of tax of $8 million). This is the definitive figure from the financial context, superseding the table-derived $250 million difference which represents the gross gain before tax.",
  "Answer": "$14 million",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- **Carrying Value (Total Long-term Borrowings)**: $4,915 million
- **Fair Value (Total Long-term Borrowings)**: $5,165 million
- The difference between the fair value and the carrying value is:
- This $250 million represents the pre-tax gain recognized in other comprehensive income for 2016, as it reflects the increase in the fair value of the debt instruments over their carrying value.
- Carrying value of long-term borrowings at December 31, 2016: $4,915 million
- Fair value of long-term borrowings at December 31, 2016: $5,165 million
