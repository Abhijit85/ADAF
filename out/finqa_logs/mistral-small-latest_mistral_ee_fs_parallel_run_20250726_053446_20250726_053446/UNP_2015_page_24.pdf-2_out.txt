=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage change in free cash flow from 2013 to 2014?",
  "Calculation": "1. Free cash flow in 2013 = $2085 million\n2. Free cash flow in 2014 = $1504 million\n3. Difference = $1504 - $2085 = -$581 million\n4. Percentage Change = (-$581 / $2085) × 100 ≈ -27.87%",
  "Answer": "-27.87%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Free cash flow in 2013 = $2,085 million
- Free cash flow in 2014 = $1,504 million
- Difference = $1,504 - $2,085 = -$581 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2013 Value) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-$581 / $2,085) × 100 ≈ -27.87%
- Difference = $1,504 million - $2,085 million = -$581 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2013 Value) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-$581 million / $2,085 million) × 100 ≈ -27.87%
