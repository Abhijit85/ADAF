=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage growth in the operating profit as reported from 2017 to 2018",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify operating profit for 2017 and 2018: 2017 = $1194 million, 2018 = $1211 million. 2. Calculate difference: $1211 - $1194 = $17 million. 3. Calculate percentage growth: ($17 / $1194) × 100 ≈ 1.43%.",
  "Answer": "1.43%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2018: $1,211
- 2017: $1,194
- Difference = $1,211 - $1,194 = $17
- Percentage Growth = (Difference / 2017 Value) × 100
- Percentage Growth = ($17 / $1,194) × 100 ≈ 1.43%
- Difference = $1,211 - $1,194 = $17 million
- Percentage Growth = (Difference / 2017 Value) × 100
- Percentage Growth = ($17 / $1,194) × 100 ≈ 1.43%
