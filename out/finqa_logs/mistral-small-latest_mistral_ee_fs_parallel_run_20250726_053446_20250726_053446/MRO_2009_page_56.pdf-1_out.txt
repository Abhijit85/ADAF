=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "by what percentage did the average wti crude oil benchmark decrease from 2007 to 2009?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify WTI crude oil prices: 2007 = $72.41, 2009 = $62.09. 2. Calculate difference: $72.41 - $62.09 = $10.32. 3. Calculate percentage decrease: ($10.32 / $72.41) × 100 ≈ 14.25%.",
  "Answer": "14.25%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2007: $72.41
- 2009: $62.09
- Difference = $72.41 - $62.09 = $10.32
- Percentage Decrease = (Difference / 2007 Price) × 100
- Percentage Decrease = ($10.32 / $72.41) × 100 ≈ 14.25%
- Difference = $72.41 (2007) - $62.09 (2009) = $10.32
- Percentage Decrease = (Difference / 2007 Price) × 100
- Percentage Decrease = ($10.32 / $72.41) × 100 ≈ 14.25%
