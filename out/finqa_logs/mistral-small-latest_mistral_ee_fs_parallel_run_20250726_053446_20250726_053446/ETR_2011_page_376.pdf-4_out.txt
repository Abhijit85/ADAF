=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the ratio of the net income to the revenues in 2010",
  "Calculation": "The ratio is calculated as Net Income (2010) / Net Revenue (2010). However, the net income for 2010 is not provided in the table or text. The table shows Net Revenue (2010) = $540.2 million, but the net income for 2010 cannot be derived from the given data.",
  "Answer": "Unable to calculate: Net income for 2010 is missing.",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- **Net revenue in 2010**: $540.2 million (as stated in the table under "2010 net revenue").
- The **net income for 2010** (either directly or the net income for 2009 to derive it from the $2.4 million increase).
