=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the change in billions of total debt from december 31 , 2014 to 2015?",
  "Calculation": "Change in total debt = Total debt at December 31, 2015 - Total debt at December 31, 2014 = $28.5 billion - $29.5 billion = -$1.0 billion",
  "Answer": "-$1.0 billion",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- $500 (2015-2017 note) + $750 (2015-2025 note) = $1,250.
- December 31, 2014: $29.5 billion
- December 31, 2015: $28.5 billion
- Change = Total debt at December 31, 2015 - Total debt at December 31, 2014
- Change = $28.5 billion - $29.5 billion = -$1.0 billion
- The table shows $1.25 billion in new debt issued in 2015, but the total debt decreased by $1.0 billion. This implies that the company likely repaid or retired more debt than it issued during the year.
