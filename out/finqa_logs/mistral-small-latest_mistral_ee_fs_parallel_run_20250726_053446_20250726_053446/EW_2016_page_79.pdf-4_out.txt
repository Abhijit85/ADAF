✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what percentage of the total cash purchase price net of cash acquired was represented by ipr&d?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the part (IPR&D) = $190.0 million\n2. Identify the base (Total cash purchase price, net of cash acquired) = $320.1 million\n3. Calculate the percentage: (190.0 / 320.1) × 100\n4. Perform the division: 190.0 / 320.1 ≈ 0.5935\n5. Multiply by 100 to get percentage: 0.5935 × 100 ≈ 59.35%",
