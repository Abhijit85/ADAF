=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what are the pre tax gains recognized in other comprehensive income in 2015?",
  "Calculation": "The text explicitly states the pre-tax gains recognized in other comprehensive income for 2015 as $19 million (net of tax of $11 million). No additional calculations are required as the value is directly provided in the text context.",
  "Answer": "$19 million",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- **Carrying Value of Total Long-term Borrowings**: $4,915 million
- **Fair Value of Total Long-term Borrowings**: $5,165 million
- The pre-tax gains are $250 million.
- The table shows the carrying value and fair value of long-term borrowings at December 31, 2015, but the pre-tax gains are already provided in the text.
