=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage change in the unrecognized tax benefits from 2015 to 2016?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify unrecognized tax benefits: 2015 = $373 million, 2016 = $369 million. 2. Calculate difference: $369 - $373 = -$4 million. 3. Calculate percentage change: (-$4 / $373) × 100 ≈ -1.07%.",
  "Answer": "-1.07%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2015: $373
- 2016: $369
- Difference = $369 - $373 = -$4
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2015 Value) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-$4 / $373) × 100 ≈ -1.07%
- Difference = $369 million - $373 million = -$4 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2015 Value) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-$4 million / $373 million) × 100 ≈ -1.07%
