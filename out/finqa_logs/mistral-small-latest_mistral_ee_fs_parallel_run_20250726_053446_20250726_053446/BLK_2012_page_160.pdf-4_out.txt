=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what portion of tax benefit would affect the effective tax rate if recognized as of december 31 , 2012?",
  "Calculation": "The text explicitly states that $250 million of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2012, would affect the effective tax rate if recognized. The total unrecognized tax benefits at that date were $404 million. Therefore, the portion affecting the effective tax rate is calculated as (250 / 404) * 100.",
  "Answer": "61.88%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Balance at January 1, 2012: \$349 million
- Balance at December 31, 2012: \$404 million
- Net change = Balance at December 31, 2012 - Balance at January 1, 2012
- Net change = \$404 million - \$349 million = \$55 million
- Additions for tax positions of prior years: \$4 million
- Reductions for tax positions of prior years: -\$1 million
- Additions based on tax positions related to current year: \$69 million
- Lapse of statute of limitations: \$0 million (denoted as "—")
- Settlements: -\$29 million
- Positions assumed in acquisitions: \$12 million
- Net change = \$4 - \$1 + \$69 + \$0 - \$29 + \$12 = \$55 million (matches the calculated net change).
- The additions based on tax positions related to the current year (\$69 million) and the positions assumed in acquisitions (\$12 million) are the portions that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized.
- Total portion affecting the effective tax rate = \$69 million + \$12 million = \$81 million.
- Percentage = (Portion affecting effective tax rate / Net change) × 100
- Percentage = (\$81 million / \$55 million) × 100 ≈ 147.27%
- Portion affecting effective tax rate = Additions for current year + Positions assumed in acquisitions
- Portion = \$69 million + \$12 million = \$81 million
- Percentage of ending balance = (\$81 million / \$404 million) × 100 ≈ 20.05%
- The **net change in unrecognized tax benefits for 2012** was **$55 million** (calculated as $404M - $349M).
- The **additions for current year tax positions** were **$69 million**.
- The **positions assumed in acquisitions** were **$12 million**.
- The **$250 million** explicitly mentioned in the text is the portion that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized.
- The **$250 million** aligns with the **$69 million (current year) + $12 million (acquisitions) = $81 million** from the table.
- However, the text states **$250 million**, suggesting additional context (e.g., prior-year adjustments or other factors).
- **Portion affecting ETR** = $250 million
- **Total unrecognized tax benefits (end of 2012)** = $404 million
- **Percentage** = (250 / 404) × 100 ≈ **61.88%**
