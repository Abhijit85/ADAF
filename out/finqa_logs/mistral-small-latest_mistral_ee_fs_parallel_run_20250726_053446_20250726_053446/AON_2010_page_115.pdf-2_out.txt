=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the percentage increase in rsus from 2009 to 2010?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify RSUs: 2009 = $124 million, 2010 = $138 million. 2. Difference = $138 million - $124 million = $14 million. 3. Percentage Increase = ($14 million / $124 million) × 100 ≈ 11.29%.",
  "Answer": "11.29%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2009 RSUs = $124
- 2010 RSUs = $138
- Difference = $138 - $124 = $14
- Percentage Increase = (Difference / 2009 RSUs) × 100
- Percentage Increase = ($14 / $124) × 100 ≈ 11.29%
- Difference = $138 million - $124 million = $14 million
- Percentage Increase = (Difference / 2009 RSUs) × 100
- Percentage Increase = ($14 million / $124 million) × 100 ≈ 11.29%
