=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "in 2010 what was the percentage change in the deferred policy acquisition costs and present value of future profits",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the 'Balance, December 31' values for 2010 and 2009: 2010: $9857, 2009: $10686. 2. Calculate the difference: $9857 - $10686 = -$829. 3. Calculate the percentage change: (-$829 / $10686) × 100 ≈ -7.76%.",
  "Answer": "-7.76%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2010: $9,857
- 2009: $10,686
- Difference = 2010 value - 2009 value = $9,857 - $10,686 = -$829
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2009 value) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-$829 / $10,686) × 100 ≈ -7.76%
- Difference = $9,857 (2010) - $10,686 (2009) = -$829
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2009 Balance) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-$829 / $10,686) × 100 ≈ -7.76%
- The text explains that the decrease in the deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) balance in 2010 was influenced by:
- Actual separate account returns being above estimated returns.
- Assumption updates related to benefits from withdrawals, lapses, hedging, annuitization estimates, and long-term expected rate of return updates.
- Adoption of new accounting guidance for embedded credit derivatives, which resulted in a DAC benefit.
