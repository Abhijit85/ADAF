=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what portion of tax benefit would affect the effective tax rate if recognized as of december 31 , 2011?",
  "Calculation": "The text explicitly states that the portion of unrecognized tax benefits affecting the effective tax rate as of December 31, 2011, is $226 million. This value is directly provided in the context and does not require further calculation.",
  "Answer": "$226 million",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Balance at January 1, 2011: $307 million
- Balance at December 31, 2011: $349 million
- Net change = Balance at December 31, 2011 - Balance at January 1, 2011
- Net change = $349 million - $307 million = $42 million
- Additions for tax positions of prior years: $22 million
- Reductions for tax positions of prior years: $(1) million
- Additions based on tax positions related to current year: $46 million
- Lapse of statute of limitations: $0 million (denoted as "—")
- Settlements: $(25) million
- Positions assumed in acquisitions: $0 million (denoted as "—")
- Net change = $22 million - $1 million + $46 million - $25 million = $42 million (matches the calculated net change).
- The additions based on tax positions related to the current year ($46 million) are the amounts that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized. This is because these additions represent new tax positions taken in the current year that could impact the tax expense or benefit.
- The relevant portion is the "included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits" for 2011, which is $226 million.
