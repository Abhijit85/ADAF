=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the applied 2019s net sales in 2018 , ( in billions ) ?",
  "Calculation": "No data available for 'Applied 2019s net sales in 2018' in the provided table or text context.",
  "Answer": "Unable to determine",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Since the table does not contain the required data and the text context does not provide the net sales figures for 2018, it is impossible to calculate the net sales for 2018 based on the given information.
- The actual net sales figures for Applied 2019s in 2018 are needed to answer the question. This information is not present in the provided table or text context.
- **Unable to determine**: The required data for "Applied 2019s net sales in 2018" is not available in the provided table or text context. Additional financial data for the year 2018 is needed to perform this calculation.
