=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what would the investment income ( loss ) have been in 2014 without the gain from the sale of the investment in clearwire corporation in 2013?",
  "Calculation": "The text states the $443 million gain from Clearwire was the primary driver of the change in investment income (loss) in 2014. Without this gain, the investment income (loss) would be: I_2014 - 443 million. However, the total investment income (loss) for 2014 (I_2014) is not provided in the table or text context.",
  "Answer": "Additional Context Required: The total investment income (loss) for 2014 is needed to perform this calculation.",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The table does not provide the total investment income (loss) for 2014 or the breakdown of components other than the Clearwire gain.
- The total investment income (loss) for 2014 (i.e., \( I_{2014} \)) is needed to perform the calculation. This information is not provided in the table or the given text context.
