=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "considering the year 2009 , what is the percentage of the segment's operating income among the total operating income?",
  "Calculation": "The calculation cannot be completed because the total operating income for 2009 is not provided in either the table or the text. The segment's operating income is $900 million (from text), but the total operating income is missing.",
  "Answer": "Unable to answer: Total operating income for 2009 is required.",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Segment operating income (2009) = $203
- Segment revenue (2009) = $1,267
- **Segment Operating Income (2009)**: $203 million (but this contradicts the $900 million from the text, suggesting the table may refer to a different segment or is incomplete).
- **Segment Revenue (2009)**: $1,267 million (but again, this may not align with the text's $900 million operating income for the segment).
- The **total operating income** for the company in 2009 is needed to compute the percentage. This is not provided in the given text or table.
