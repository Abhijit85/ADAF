=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage change in fuel surcharge program freight revenue from 2012 to 2013?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify fuel surcharge revenues from text context: 2012 = $2.6 billion, 2013 = $2.6 billion. 2. Calculate difference: $2.6 billion - $2.6 billion = $0 billion. 3. Calculate percentage change: ($0 / $2.6 billion) × 100 = 0%.",
  "Answer": "0%",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2012 Freight Revenue = $19,686 million
- 2013 Freight Revenue = $20,684 million
- Difference = $20,684 - $19,686 = $998 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2012 Freight Revenue) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($998 / $19,686) × 100 ≈ 5.07%
- 2012 Fuel Surcharge Revenue = $2.6 billion
- 2013 Fuel Surcharge Revenue = $2.6 billion
- Difference = $2.6 billion - $2.6 billion = $0 billion
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2012 Fuel Surcharge Revenue) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($0 / $2.6 billion) × 100 = 0%
