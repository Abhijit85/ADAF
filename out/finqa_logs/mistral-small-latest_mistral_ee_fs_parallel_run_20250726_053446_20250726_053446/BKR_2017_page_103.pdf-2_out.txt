=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the risk free interest of the stock based compensation expense in 2017?",
  "Calculation": "The risk-free interest rate is explicitly provided in both the table and text context as 2.1%. No additional calculations are required as the value is directly given.",
  "Answer": "2.1%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The value is consistent with typical risk-free rates for the period (2017) and aligns with the context of stock-based compensation expense calculations.
- No additional calculations are needed as the value is explicitly given.
