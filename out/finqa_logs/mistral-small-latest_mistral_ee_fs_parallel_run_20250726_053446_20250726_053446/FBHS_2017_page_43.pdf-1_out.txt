=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage growth in the defined benefit plan income from 2016 to 2017",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the defined benefit plan income for 2016 and 2017 from the table: 2016: $2.9 million, 2017: $4.2 million. 2. Calculate the difference in income between 2016 and 2017: $4.2 million - $2.9 million = $1.3 million. 3. Calculate the percentage growth using the formula: (Difference / 2016 Income) × 100 = ($1.3 million / $2.9 million) × 100 ≈ 44.83%.",
  "Answer": "44.83%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2016: \$2.9 million
- 2017: \$4.2 million
- Difference = \$4.2 million - \$2.9 million = \$1.3 million
- Percentage Growth = (Difference / 2016 Income) × 100
- Percentage Growth = (\$1.3 million / \$2.9 million) × 100 ≈ 44.83%
- Difference = \$4.2 million - \$2.9 million = \$1.3 million.
- Percentage Growth = (Difference / 2016 Income) × 100
- Percentage Growth = (\$1.3 million / \$2.9 million) × 100 ≈ 44.83%.
