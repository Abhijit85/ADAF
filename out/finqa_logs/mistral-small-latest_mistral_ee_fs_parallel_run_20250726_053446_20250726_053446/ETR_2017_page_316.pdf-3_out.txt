=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "in 2016 what was the ratio of the net income increased to the net revenues",
  "Calculation": "Net Income Increase (2016) = $92.9 million (from text) / Net Revenues (2016) = $1520.5 million (from table) = 92.9 / 1520.5 ≈ 0.0610",
  "Answer": "0.0610 (or 6.10%)",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Net income increase in 2016: This is the sum of all positive and negative adjustments to the 2016 net revenue to arrive at the 2017 net revenue.
- Retail electric price: +33.8
- Opportunity sales: +5.6
- Asset retirement obligation: -14.8
- Volume/weather: -29.0
- Other: +6.5
- **Total net income increase** = 33.8 + 5.6 - 14.8 - 29.0 + 6.5 = 5.1 (in millions)
- Net revenues in 2016: $1,520.5 (in millions)
- From the table: **$1,520.5 million** (in millions).
---
- None, as the net income increase for 2016 is explicitly stated in the text.
- The ratio (6.10%) is reasonable given the context of financial performance, where net income changes are typically a small percentage of total revenues.
