  "Question": "compared to the lowest stock price , how much did advanced auto parts outperform the overall market?",
  "Calculation": [
    "1. Advance Auto Parts outperformance = (($201.18 - $97.26) / $97.26) × 100 ≈ 106.85%",
    "2. S&P 500 outperformance = (($104.24 - $65.70) / $65.70) × 100 ≈ 58.66%",

}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The lowest price in the table is **$97.26** (January 3, 2009).
- The highest price in the table is **$201.18** (December 31, 2011).
- Difference = Highest price - Lowest price
- Difference = $201.18 - $97.26 = **$103.92**
- Percentage Outperformance = (Difference / Lowest price) × 100
- Percentage Outperformance = ($103.92 / $97.26) × 100 ≈ **106.85%**
- Lowest S&P 500 price: **$65.70** (January 3, 2009)
- Highest S&P 500 price: **$104.24** (December 29, 2007)
- Difference = $104.24 - $65.70 = **$38.54**
- Percentage Outperformance = ($38.54 / $65.70) × 100 ≈ **58.66%**
- Difference in Outperformance = Advance Auto Parts Outperformance - S&P 500 Outperformance
- Difference = 106.85% - 58.66% = **48.19%**
- Difference = Highest price - Lowest price = $201.18 - $97.26 = $103.92
- Percentage Outperformance = ($103.92 / $97.26) × 100 ≈ 106.85%
- Difference = Highest price - Lowest price = $104.24 - $65.70 = $38.54
- Percentage Outperformance = ($38.54 / $65.70) × 100 ≈ 58.66%
- AAP Outperformance - S&P 500 Outperformance = 106.85% - 58.66% = 48.19%
