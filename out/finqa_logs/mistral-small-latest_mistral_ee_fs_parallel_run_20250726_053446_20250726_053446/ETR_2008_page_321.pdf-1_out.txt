✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the annual interest expense for entergy louisiana incurred from the series first mortgage bonds due september 2018 , in millions?",
  "Calculation": "Annual Interest Expense = Principal × Interest Rate = $300000000 × 6.50% = $300000000 × 0.065 = $19500000 = $19.5 million",
  "Answer": "$19.5 million",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2008: $61,236 (in thousands)
- 2007: ($2,791) (in thousands)
- 2006: ($54,041) (in thousands)
- 2005: ($68,677) (in thousands)
- The table data provided does not include the interest expense for these bonds, so the calculation relies solely on the bond issuance details from the text.
- No adjustments (e.g., for partial years or amortization) are needed, as the question asks for the annual interest expense based on the full principal and stated rate.
