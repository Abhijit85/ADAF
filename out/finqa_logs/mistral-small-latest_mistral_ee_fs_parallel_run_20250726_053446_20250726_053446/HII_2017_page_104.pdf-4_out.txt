=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the ratio of the deffered tax assets for the state income tax credit carry-forwards to the net operating loss carry-forward",
  "Calculation": "Ratio = (Deferred tax assets for state income tax credit carry-forwards) / (Deferred tax assets for net operating loss carry-forward) = 16 million / 3 million = 5.33",
  "Answer": "5.33",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
---
- The **valuation allowance** (e.g., $7 million for state income tax credit carry-forwards) is not needed for this calculation, as the question specifically asks for the ratio of the **deferred tax assets** (not net of valuation allowance).
- The **expiration years** of the carry-forwards are irrelevant for this ratio calculation.
