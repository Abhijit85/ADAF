  "Answer": "105.75%",

}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Since the adjusted consolidated cash flow is derived from the consolidated cash flow plus four times the tower cash flow for the three months, we can infer that the tower cash flow portion is the difference between the adjusted consolidated cash flow and the non-tower cash flow.
- However, the table directly provides the non-tower cash flow as $(30,584), so the tower cash flow portion can be calculated as:
- Alternatively, we can verify this by summing the components:
- Therefore, the portion of the adjusted consolidated cash flow related to tower cash flow is $562,406.
- (Tower Cash Flow Portion / Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow) × 100 = ($562,406 / $531,822) × 100 ≈ 105.75%
