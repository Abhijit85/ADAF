=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what on the net interest reduction of 13 million or 23% ( 23 % ) compared to 2015 what was the interest amount in 2016 in millions",
  "Calculation": "1. Let the interest amount in 2015 be X. 2. The reduction of 23% means the 2016 interest amount is 0.77X. 3. The difference between 2015 and 2016 is 0.23X = 13 million. 4. Solve for X: 0.23X = 13 → X = 13 / 0.23 ≈ 56.52 million. 5. The interest amount in 2016 is 0.77 * 56.52 ≈ 43.52 million.",
