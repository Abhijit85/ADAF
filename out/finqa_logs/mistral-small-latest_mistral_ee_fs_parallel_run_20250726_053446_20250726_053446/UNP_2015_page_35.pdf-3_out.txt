✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage change in cash provided by operating activities from 2013 to 2014?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify values: 2013 = $6823 million, 2014 = $7385 million. 2. Calculate difference: $7385 - $6823 = $562 million. 3. Calculate percentage change: ($562 / $6823) × 100 ≈ 8.24%.",
  "Answer": "8.24%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2013: $6,823 million
- 2014: $7,385 million
- Difference = $7,385 - $6,823 = $562 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2013 Value) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($562 / $6,823) × 100 ≈ 8.24%
