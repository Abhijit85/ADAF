  "Question": "what is the growth of the additions in comparison with the growth of the deductions during 2003 and 2004?",
  "Calculation": "Additions Growth: ((82551000 - 68125000) / 68125000) * 100 = 21.18%\nDeductions Growth: ((-1390000 - (-4645000)) / -4645000) * 100 = -70.08%",

Answer Echoes:
- **Additions (2003)**: $68,125,000
- **Additions (2004)**: $82,551,000
- **Deductions (2003)**: $(4,645,000)
- **Deductions (2004)**: $(1,390,000)
- **Growth in Additions**:
- **Growth in Deductions**:
- **Additions Growth**: +21.18%
- **Deductions Growth**: -70.08%
- Additions Growth: \(\frac{82,551,000 - 68,125,000}{68,125,000} \times 100 = 21.18\%\)
- Deductions Growth: \(\frac{-1,390,000 - (-4,645,000)}{-4,645,000} \times 100 = -70.08\%\)
- Additions grew by **21.18%**.
- Deductions decreased by **70.08%**.
- **Additions (2003)**: $68,125,000
- **Additions (2004)**: $82,551,000
- **Deductions (2003)**: $(4,645,000)
- **Deductions (2004)**: $(1,390,000)
- **Additions grew by 21.18%** from 2003 to 2004.
- **Deductions decreased by 70.08%** over the same period.
