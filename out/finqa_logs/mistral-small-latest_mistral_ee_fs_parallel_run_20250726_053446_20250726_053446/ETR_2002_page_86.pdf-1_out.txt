✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the percent change in annual long-term debt maturities ( excluding lease obligations ) and annual cash sinking fund requirements for debt outstanding from 2005 to 2004?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify values: 2004 = $925005, 2005 = $540372\n2. Calculate difference: $540372 - $925005 = -$384633\n3. Calculate percent change: (-$384633 / $925005) × 100 ≈ -41.57%",
  "Answer": "-41.57%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2004: $925,005
- 2005: $540,372
- Difference = $540,372 - $925,005 = -$384,633
- Percent Change = (Difference / 2004 Value) × 100
- Percent Change = (-$384,633 / $925,005) × 100 ≈ -41.57%
- The table data provided in the question is sufficient to answer the question. No additional context from the text is needed for this specific calculation. However, the text provides supplementary information about the nature of the debt, remarketing, and other financial obligations, which could be relevant for broader financial analysis but not for this specific question.
