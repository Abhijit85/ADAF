=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage change in total long-term debt net from 2014 to 2015?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify values: 2014 = $6142 million, 2015 = $15261 million. 2. Calculate difference: $15261 - $6142 = $9119 million. 3. Calculate percentage change: ($9119 / $6142) × 100 ≈ 148.46%.",
  "Answer": "148.46%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2015: $15,261
- 2014: $6,142
- Difference = 2015 value - 2014 value = $15,261 - $6,142 = $9,119
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2014 value) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($9,119 / $6,142) × 100 ≈ 148.46%
- Difference = $15,261 million - $6,142 million = $9,119 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2014 value) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($9,119 million / $6,142 million) × 100 ≈ 148.46%
