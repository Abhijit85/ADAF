=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "in these equity investment balances , what is the percent of unfunded commitments at december 31 , 2013?",
  "Calculation": "Total equity investment balances (approximate) = $2.7B (tax credit + equity investments) + $1.7B (private equity investments) + $0.158B (Visa Class B shares) = $4.558B. Unfunded commitments = $966M. Percentage = (966 / 4558) * 100 ≈ 21.2%.",
  "Answer": "21.2%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- **Tax credit investments + equity investments held by consolidated partnerships**: $2.7 billion (2013).
- **Private equity investments**: $1.7 billion (2013).
- **Visa Class B shares**: $158 million (recorded value).
- **Unfunded commitments at December 31, 2013**: $802 million (for tax credit and equity investments) + $164 million (for private equity) = **$966 million total unfunded commitments**.
- The text does not provide a single total for all equity investments. However, the closest aggregate is:
- Tax credit + equity investments: $2.7 billion.
- Private equity investments: $1.7 billion.
- Visa Class B shares: $158 million (recorded value).
- **Total equity investments (approximate)**: $2.7B + $1.7B + $0.158B = **$4.558 billion**.
