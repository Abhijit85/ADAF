=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the growth rate of the net earnings attributable to pmi?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify net earnings: 2017 = $6035 million, 2016 = $6967 million. 2. Calculate difference: $6035 - $6967 = -$932 million. 3. Compute growth rate: (-$932 / $6967) * 100 ≈ -13.38%.",
  "Answer": "-13.38%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2017: $6,035 million
- 2016: $6,967 million
- Difference = 2017 - 2016 = $6,035 - $6,967 = -$932 million
- Growth Rate = (Difference / 2016) × 100
- Growth Rate = (-$932 / $6,967) × 100 ≈ -13.38%
- Difference = 2017 net earnings - 2016 net earnings
- Difference = $6,035 million - $6,967 million = -$932 million
- Growth Rate = (Difference / 2016 net earnings) × 100
- Growth Rate = (-$932 million / $6,967 million) × 100 ≈ -13.38%
