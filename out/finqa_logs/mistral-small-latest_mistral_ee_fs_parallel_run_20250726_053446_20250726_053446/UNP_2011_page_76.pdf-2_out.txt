=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "in 2011 , did the company distribute more to shareholders than debtholders?",
  "Calculation": "Dividends payable (2011) = $284 million; Interest payable (2011) = $197 million. Since $284 > $197, the company distributed more to shareholders than to debtholders in 2011.",
  "Answer": "Yes, the company distributed more to shareholders ($284 million) than to debtholders ($197 million) in 2011.",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- **Dividends payable (2011)**: $284 million
- **Interest payable (2011)**: $197 million
- Dividends payable = $284 million
- Interest payable = $197 million
- Dividends payable = $284 million
- Interest payable = $197 million
