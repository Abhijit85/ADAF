=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the increase observed in the balance at the end of the year during 2005 and 2004?",
  "Calculation": "Increase = Balance at the end of 2005 - Balance at the end of 2004 = $663750000 - $595338000 = $68412000",
  "Answer": "$68412000",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Increase = Balance at the end of 2005 - Balance at the end of 2004
- Increase = $663,750,000 - $595,338,000
- Increase = $68,412,000
