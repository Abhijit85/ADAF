=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the percentage change in average of investments from 2014 to 2015?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify average investments: 2014 = $16831.9 million, 2015 = $17430.8 million. 2. Calculate difference: $17430.8 - $16831.9 = $598.9 million. 3. Calculate percentage change: ($598.9 / $16831.9) × 100 ≈ 3.56%.",
  "Answer": "3.56%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2014: $16,831.9 million
- 2015: $17,430.8 million
- Difference = $17,430.8 - $16,831.9 = $598.9 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2014 Value) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($598.9 / $16,831.9) × 100 ≈ 3.56%
