✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the current ratio?",
  "Calculation": "Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities = $28.1 million / $32.9 million ≈ 0.854",
  "Answer": 0.854,
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Current Assets = $28.1
- Current Liabilities = $32.9 (Note: The table shows Current liabilities assumed as -$32.9, which implies a liability of $32.9)
