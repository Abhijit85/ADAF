=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "in 2017 what was amount net sales applicable to international market in millions",
  "Calculation": "Unable to calculate due to missing data: total net sales for 2017 and segment breakdowns (Cabinets, Plumbing, Doors, Security) are required. Text context provides international sales percentages for Plumbing (26%) and Security (25%), but no segment or total sales figures are available in the table.",
  "Answer": "Unable to determine from provided data",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- **2017 Net Sales by Segment (in millions)**:
- Cabinets: $XXX (not provided in the given table)
- Plumbing: $XXX (not provided in the given table)
- Doors: $XXX (not provided in the given table)
- Security: $XXX (not provided in the given table)
- **Total Net Sales (2017)**: $XXX (not provided in the given table)
- **Issue**: The table does not provide the total net sales for 2017 or the breakdown by segment, which is required to calculate the international sales.
- The table does not provide the total net sales for 2017 or the net sales for each segment (Cabinets, Plumbing, Doors, Security).
- Without these values, we cannot calculate the international sales percentage.
- If the total net sales for 2017 were provided (e.g., $X million), we could calculate the international sales as follows:
- **Plumbing International Sales**: 26% of Plumbing Net Sales.
- **Security International Sales**: 25% of Security Net Sales.
- **Total International Sales**: Sum of international sales from all segments (assuming Doors and Cabinets had 0% international sales, as no data is provided).
- However, since the table does not provide the total net sales or segment breakdowns, this calculation is impossible.
- The **total net sales for 2017** (in millions).
- The **net sales for each segment (Cabinets, Plumbing, Doors, Security) in 2017** (in millions).
- The **international sales percentage for the Doors and Cabinets segments** (if applicable).
