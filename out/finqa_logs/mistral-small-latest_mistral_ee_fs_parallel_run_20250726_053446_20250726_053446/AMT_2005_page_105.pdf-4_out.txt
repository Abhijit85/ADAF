=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what portion of total value of net operating loss carryforwards is related to state?",
  "Calculation": "1. Total net operating loss carryforwards = $2157503000 (Federal) + $2418012000 (State) = $4575515000\n2. State portion = $2418012000\n3. Percentage = ($2418012000 / $4575515000) × 100 = 52.85%",
  "Answer": "52.85%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Total = Federal + State
- Total = $2,157,503,000 + $2,418,012,000 = $4,575,515,000
- State portion = $2,418,012,000
- Percentage = (State portion / Total) × 100
- Percentage = ($2,418,012,000 / $4,575,515,000) × 100 ≈ 52.85%
- The calculation is consistent with the provided table data and aligns with the text context.
- The percentage is reasonable given the values of federal and state carryforwards.
