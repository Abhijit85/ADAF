✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percent of the total contractual obligations for future payments for total debt in 2005",
  "Calculation": "Total contractual obligations for future payments (Thereafter) = $7657 million\nTotal debt (Thereafter) = $6281 million\nPercentage = ($6281 / $7657) × 100 ≈ 82.03%",
  "Answer": "82.03%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The table provides contractual obligations for future payments from **2006 to 2010 and thereafter**.
- The "Thereafter" column likely includes obligations beyond 2010, which may encompass 2005.
- **Total contractual obligations (Thereafter)**: $7,657 million
- **Total debt (Thereafter)**: $6,281 million
- The text confirms that the table includes contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments as of **December 31, 2005**.
- The "Thereafter" column is the only available data that could include 2005 obligations.
