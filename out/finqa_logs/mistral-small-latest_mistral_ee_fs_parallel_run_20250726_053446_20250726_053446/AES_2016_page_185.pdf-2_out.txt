=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the change in millions of ipalco common stock from 2015 to 2016?",
  "Calculation": "IPALCO common stock in 2016: $618 million - IPALCO common stock in 2015: $460 million = $158 million",
  "Answer": "158 million",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2016: $618 million
- 2015: $460 million
- $618 - $460 = $158 million
- 2016: $618 million
- 2015: $460 million
- $618 million (2016) - $460 million (2015) = $158 million
