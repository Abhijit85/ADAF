=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the change in the balance of liability for all restructuring from 2006 to 2008 , ( in millions ) ?",
  "Calculation": "Change = Liability at December 31, 2008 - Liability at December 31, 2006 = $12.8 million - $31.8 million = -$19.0 million",
  "Answer": "-$19.0 million",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Liability at December 31, 2006 (Total) = $31.8 million
- Liability at December 31, 2008 (Total) = $12.8 million
- Change = Liability at December 31, 2008 - Liability at December 31, 2006
- Change = $12.8 million - $31.8 million
- Change = -$19.0 million
