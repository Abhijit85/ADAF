=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the change in millions of total long-term debt net from 2014 to 2015?",
  "Calculation": "Change = 2015 value - 2014 value = $15261 million - $6142 million = $9119 million",
  "Answer": "$9119 million",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2015: $15,261 million
- 2014: $6,142 million
- Change = 2015 value - 2014 value
- Change = $15,261 million - $6,142 million
- Change = $9,119 million
- Change = 2015 value - 2014 value
- Change = $15,261 million - $6,142 million
- Change = $9,119 million
- The increase in long-term debt was primarily due to the issuance of $7.0 billion of notes on November 23, 2015, to fund the acquisition of Sikorsky and for general corporate purposes. The proceeds were used to repay $6.0 billion of borrowings under the 364-day revolving credit facility. The remaining $1.0 billion was used for general corporate purposes, contributing to the increase in long-term debt.
