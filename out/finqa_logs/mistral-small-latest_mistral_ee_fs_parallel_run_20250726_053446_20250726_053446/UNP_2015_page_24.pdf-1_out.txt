✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the ratio of the free cash flow to the cash provided by operating activities in 2015",
  "Calculation": "Ratio = Free cash flow / Cash provided by operating activities = $524 million / $7344 million ≈ 0.0713 (or approximately 7.13%)",
  "Answer": "0.0713 (or approximately 7.13%)",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Free cash flow in 2015 = $524 million
- Cash provided by operating activities in 2015 = $7,344 million
- Ratio = Free cash flow / Cash provided by operating activities
- Ratio = $524 / $7,344
- Ratio ≈ 0.0713 (rounded to 4 decimal places)
- Free cash flow (non-GAAP measure) = $524 million
- Cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) = $7,344 million
- Ratio = Free cash flow / Cash provided by operating activities
- Ratio = $524 / $7,344
- Ratio ≈ 0.0713 (rounded to 4 decimal places)
