=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what amount of long-term debt due in the next 36 months as of december 31 , 2003 , in millions?",
  "Calculation": "The table does not contain data for 2003 or explicit long-term debt figures. The text mentions mandatory tender dates within 36 months (2004-2006) but does not provide specific dollar amounts. Therefore, the required calculation cannot be performed with the given information.",
  "Answer": "Unable to determine due to insufficient data",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- **Mandatory Tender Dates**:
- Bonds subject to mandatory tender on **September 1, 2004** (within 36 months of December 31, 2003).
- Bonds subject to mandatory tender on **September 1, 2005** (within 36 months of December 31, 2003).
- Bonds subject to mandatory tender on **June 1, 2005** (within 36 months of December 31, 2003).
- **Debt Maturities**:
- The text mentions that the **annual long-term debt maturities (excluding lease obligations) for debt outstanding as of December 31, 2003, for the next five years** are provided in a table (though the table is not fully visible in the given data).
- However, the table provided does not contain data for 2003 or explicit long-term debt figures.
- The table does not include **2003 data** or **long-term debt maturities** for the next 36 months.
- The text does not provide a **specific dollar amount** for long-term debt due in the next 36 months.
- The **exact long-term debt maturities for 2004, 2005, and 2006** (next 36 months from December 31, 2003) must be provided in the table or text.
- If the table had included **2003 data**, the sum of debt maturing in 2004, 2005, and 2006 would be the required answer.
