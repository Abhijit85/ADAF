=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the net change in net revenue for entergy texas , inc . during 2007?",
  "Calculation": "Net change = 2007 net revenue - 2006 net revenue = $442.3 million - $403.3 million = $39.0 million",
  "Answer": "$39.0 million",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Net Change = 2007 Net Revenue - 2006 Net Revenue
- Net Change = $442.3 million - $403.3 million
- Net Change = $39.0 million
- The calculation is straightforward subtraction, and the result aligns with the text context, which mentions a $39 million increase in net revenue.
- The units (millions) are consistent, and the precision (one decimal place) is appropriate for financial reporting.
