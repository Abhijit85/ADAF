=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "if overall freight revenues in 2014 grow as the same rate as agricultural arc growth , what would projected 2015 revenues be in millions?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify 2014 freight revenue: $22560 million (from table). 2. Use agricultural ARC growth rate from text: 5% (2013 growth rate). 3. Project 2015 revenue: $22560 × 1.05 = $23688 million.",
  "Answer": "$23688 million",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Projected 2015 revenue = 2014 revenue × (1 + growth rate)
- Projected 2015 revenue = $22,560 × (1 + 0.09) = $22,560 × 1.09 = $24,540.4 million
- Formula: 2014 Revenue × (1 + Growth Rate)
- Calculation: $22,560 million × (1 + 0.05) = $22,560 × 1.05 = $23,688 million
