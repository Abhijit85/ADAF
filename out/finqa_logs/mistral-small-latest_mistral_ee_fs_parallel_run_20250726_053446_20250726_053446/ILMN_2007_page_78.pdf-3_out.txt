=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage change in revenue on a pro forma basis between 2006 and 2007?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the revenue values for 2006 and 2007:\n   - 2007 Revenue = $366854 (in thousands)\n   - 2006 Revenue = $187103 (in thousands)\n2. Calculate the difference in revenue:\n   - Difference = $366854 - $187103 = $179751 (in thousands)\n3. Calculate the percentage change using 2006 revenue as the base:\n   - Percentage Change = (Difference / 2006 Revenue) × 100\n   - Percentage Change = ($179751 / $187103) × 100 ≈ 96.07%",
  "Answer": "96.07%",

}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2007 Revenue = $366,854
- 2006 Revenue = $187,103
- Difference = $366,854 - $187,103 = $179,751
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2006 Revenue) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($179,751 / $187,103) × 100 ≈ 96.07%
- Difference = 2007 Revenue - 2006 Revenue
- Difference = $366,854 - $187,103 = $179,751 (in thousands)
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2006 Revenue) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($179,751 / $187,103) × 100 ≈ 96.07%
