=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the percentage change in the unamortized debt issuance costs associated with its credit facilities from 2016 to 2017?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the unamortized debt issuance costs for 2016 and 2017 from text context: 2016: $8 million, 2017: $11 million. 2. Calculate the difference: $11 million - $8 million = $3 million. 3. Calculate the percentage change: ($3 million / $8 million) × 100 = 37.5%.",
  "Answer": "37.5%",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2016: $(27) million
- 2017: $(26) million
- Difference = 2017 cost - 2016 cost = -26 - (-27) = 1 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2016 cost) × 100
- Percentage Change = (1 / -27) × 100 ≈ -3.70%
- 2016: $8 million
- 2017: $11 million
- Difference = 2017 cost - 2016 cost = $11 million - $8 million = $3 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2016 cost) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($3 million / $8 million) × 100 = 37.5%
