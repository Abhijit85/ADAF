=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage increase of total deferred compensation plan investments from 2010 to 2011?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify values: 2010 = $8690, 2011 = $26410. 2. Calculate difference: $26410 - $8690 = $17720. 3. Calculate percentage increase: ($17720 / $8690) × 100 ≈ 203.91%.",
  "Answer": "203.91%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2011: $26,410
- 2010: $8,690
- Difference = $26,410 - $8,690 = $17,720
- Percentage Increase = (Difference / 2010 Value) × 100
- Percentage Increase = ($17,720 / $8,690) × 100 ≈ 203.91%
- Difference = $26,410 (2011) - $8,690 (2010) = $17,720
- Percentage Increase = (Difference / 2010 Value) × 100
- Percentage Increase = ($17,720 / $8,690) × 100 ≈ 203.91%
