=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage change in diluted earnings per common share december 29 2012 and december 28 2013?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the two values for diluted earnings per common share: December 29, 2012: $2.13, December 28, 2013: $1.89. 2. Calculate the difference: $1.89 - $2.13 = -$0.24. 3. Calculate the percentage change: (-$0.24 / $2.13) × 100 ≈ -11.27%.",
  "Answer": "-11.27%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- December 29, 2012: $2.13
- December 28, 2013: $1.89
- Difference = $1.89 - $2.13 = -$0.24
- Percentage Change = (Difference / Original Value) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-$0.24 / $2.13) × 100 ≈ -11.27%
