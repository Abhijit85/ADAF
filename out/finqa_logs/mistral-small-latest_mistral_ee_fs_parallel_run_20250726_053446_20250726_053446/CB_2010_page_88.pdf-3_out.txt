=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "by what amount have catastrophic losses in 2010 surpass the catastrophic losses of 2009 , ( in millions ) ?",
  "Calculation": "2010 Catastrophe Losses: $366 million - 2009 Catastrophe Losses: $137 million = $229 million",
  "Answer": "$229 million",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Catastrophe losses in 2010: (3.2)%
- Catastrophe losses in 2009: (1.2)%
- The table provides catastrophe losses as percentages (2010: -3.2%, 2009: -1.2%), but the monetary values are already explicitly stated in the text.
- 2010: $366 million
- 2009: $137 million
- Difference = 2010 value - 2009 value
- Difference = $366 million - $137 million
- Difference = $229 million
