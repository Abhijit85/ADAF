=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the growth rate in the price of shares from the highest value during the quarter ended december 31 , 2008 and the closing price on february 13 , 2009?",
  "Calculation": "1. Highest price in Q4 2008 = $37.28\n2. Closing price on February 13, 2009 = $28.85\n3. Difference = $28.85 - $37.28 = -$8.43\n4. Growth Rate = (-$8.43 / $37.28) × 100 ≈ -22.61%",
  "Answer": "-22.61%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Highest price in Q4 2008 = $37.28
- Closing price on February 13, 2009 = $28.85
- Difference = $28.85 - $37.28 = -$8.43 (decrease)
- Growth Rate = (Difference / Initial Price) × 100
- Growth Rate = (-$8.43 / $37.28) × 100 ≈ -22.61%
