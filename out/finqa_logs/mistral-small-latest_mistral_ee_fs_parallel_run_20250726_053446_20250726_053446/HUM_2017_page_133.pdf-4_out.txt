=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "considering the years 2016-2017 , what is the percentual increase observed in the payment amount per share?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify payment amounts per share: 2016 = $1.16, 2017 = $1.49. 2. Calculate difference: $1.49 - $1.16 = $0.33. 3. Calculate percentage increase: ($0.33 / $1.16) × 100 ≈ 28.45%.",
  "Answer": "28.45%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2016: $1.16
- 2017: $1.49
- Difference = $1.49 - $1.16 = $0.33
- Percentage Increase = (Difference / 2016 Amount) × 100
- Percentage Increase = ($0.33 / $1.16) × 100 ≈ 28.45%
