```

Answer Echoes:
- Shares: 705,292
- Price: $53.53
- Amount: 705,292 × $53.53 = $37,820,480.96
- Shares: 431,170
- Price: $48.11
- Amount: 431,170 × $48.11 = $20,810,378.70
- Shares: 8,310
- Price: $44.99
- Amount: 8,310 × $44.99 = $373,316.90
- Sum of all periods: $37,820,480.96 + $20,810,378.70 + $373,316.90 = $59,004,176.56
- Amount = 705,292 × $53.53 = $37,820,480.96
- Amount = 431,170 × $48.11 = $20,810,378.70
- Amount = 8,310 × $44.99 = $373,316.90
- Sum of all periods: $37,820,480.96 + $20,810,378.70 + $373,316.90 = $59,004,176.56
