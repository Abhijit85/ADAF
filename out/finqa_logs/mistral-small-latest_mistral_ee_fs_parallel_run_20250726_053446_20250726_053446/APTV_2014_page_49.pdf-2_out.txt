=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage total return for delphi automotive plc for the five years ended december 31 2014?",
  "Calculation": "Percentage Return = ((Final Value - Initial Value) / Initial Value) * 100 = ((350.82 - 100.00) / 100.00) * 100 = 250.82%",
  "Answer": "250.82%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Initial Value (November 17, 2011) = \$100.00
- Final Value (December 31, 2014) = \$350.82
- The question asks for the 5-year return, but the table data provided covers a period from November 17, 2011, to December 31, 2014 (approximately 3 years and 14 days). If the 5-year return is required, additional data for the full 5-year period would be needed. However, based on the provided data, the return over the given period is 250.82%.
