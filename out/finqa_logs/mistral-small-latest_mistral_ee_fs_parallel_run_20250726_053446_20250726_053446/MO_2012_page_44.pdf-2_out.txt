✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what are the cost reduction initiatives as a percentage of the operating companies income increase?",
  "Calculation": "Percentage = (Cost Reduction Initiatives / Operating Companies Income Increase) × 100 = (198 / 119) × 100 ≈ 166.39%",
  "Answer": "166.39%",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Cost reduction initiatives (in dollars or percentage).
- Operating companies income (in dollars or percentage increase).
- Cost Reduction = $50 million.
- Operating Income Increase = $200 million.
- Calculation: (50 / 200) × 100 = 25%.
- **Answer**: 25%.
- Increased by **$119 million (2.1%)** due to:
- Higher net pricing ($831 million, including higher promotional investments).
- Marketing, administration, and research savings from **cost reduction initiatives ($198 million)**.
- 2010 implementation costs related to the closure of the Cabarrus, North Carolina manufacturing facility ($75 million).
- Partially offset by:
- Lower volume ($527 million).
- Higher asset impairment and exit costs ($158 million).
- Higher per unit settlement charges ($120 million).
- Higher charges related to tobacco and health judgments ($87 million).
- Higher FDA user fees ($73 million).
- The text explicitly mentions **$198 million** in savings from cost reduction initiatives (marketing, administration, and research).
- None, as all necessary data was extracted from the provided text context. The table was not required for this calculation.
