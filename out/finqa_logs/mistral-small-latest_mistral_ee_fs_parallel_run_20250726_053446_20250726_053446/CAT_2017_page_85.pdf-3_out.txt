{
  "Question": "what portion of the maximum exposure to loss from vies is related to guarantees in 2018?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify 2018 data for 'Guarantees' and 'Total Maximum Exposure to Loss from VIEs' from table or text.\n2. Calculate the portion as (Guarantees / Total Exposure) * 100.\n3. Data for 2018 is missing in both table and text, so calculation cannot be performed.",
  "Answer": "Data for 2018 is insufficient to determine the portion of maximum exposure to loss from VIEs related to guarantees.",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The text mentions that Caterpillar has exposure to Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) where it is not the primary beneficiary.
- The maximum exposure to loss from these VIEs includes guarantees, but no specific breakdown is provided for 2018.
- The text also states that the risks are evaluated and reflected in the financial statements as part of the overall portfolio of finance receivables and related allowance for credit losses.
- To calculate the portion of maximum exposure to loss from VIEs related to guarantees in 2018, we need:
- The total maximum exposure to loss from VIEs in 2018.
- The portion of that exposure attributed to guarantees in 2018.
- The table does not provide 2018 data, so we cannot extract the required values.
- The text does not provide specific numerical values for 2018 guarantees or total exposure.
- Since the required data is missing, we cannot perform the calculation.
- The 2018 data for "Guarantees" and "Total Maximum Exposure to Loss from VIEs" is missing from the provided table and text.
- Without this information, the portion of the maximum exposure to loss from VIEs related to guarantees in 2018 cannot be determined.
