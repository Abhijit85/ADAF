=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what are the deferred fuel cost revisions as a percentage of the increase in fuel cost recovery revenues?",
  "Calculation": "1. Increase in fuel cost recovery revenues: $98.0 million (from text context).\n2. Deferred fuel cost revisions: $59.1 million (from text context).\n3. Percentage = (Deferred fuel cost revisions / Increase in fuel cost recovery revenues) × 100 = ($59.1 / $98.0) × 100 ≈ 60.31%",
  "Answer": "60.31%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2003 net revenue: $973.7 million
- 2002 net revenue: $922.9 million
- Increase in net revenue: $973.7 - $922.9 = $50.8 million
- Deferred fuel cost revisions: $59.1 million
- Percentage = (Deferred fuel cost revisions / Increase in net revenue) × 100
- Percentage = ($59.1 / $50.8) × 100 ≈ 116.34%
- Percentage = (Deferred fuel cost revisions / Increase in fuel cost recovery revenues) × 100
- Percentage = ($59.1 / $98.0) × 100 ≈ 60.31%
