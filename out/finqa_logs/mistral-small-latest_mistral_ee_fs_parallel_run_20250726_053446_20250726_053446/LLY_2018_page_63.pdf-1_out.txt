=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage change in inventories between 2017 and 2018?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify inventory values: 2018 = $4111.8 million, 2017 = $4458.3 million. 2. Calculate difference: $4111.8 - $4458.3 = -$346.5 million. 3. Calculate percentage change: (-$346.5 / $4458.3) × 100 ≈ -7.77%.",
  "Answer": "-7.77%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2018 Inventories: $4,111.8
- 2017 Inventories: $4,458.3
- Difference = 2018 Inventories - 2017 Inventories
- Difference = $4,111.8 - $4,458.3 = -$346.5
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2017 Inventories) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-$346.5 / $4,458.3) × 100 ≈ -7.77%
- Difference = 2018 Inventories - 2017 Inventories
- Difference = $4,111.8 - $4,458.3 = -$346.5 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2017 Inventories) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-$346.5 / $4,458.3) × 100 ≈ -7.77%
