=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "Assuming a FMV of a share equal to 2000, under the pre-December 31, 2007 plan, approximately how many shares would each non-employee director receive annually?",
  "Calculation": "1. Calculate 1/3 of FMV per share: (1/3) * 2000 = 666.67\n2. Divide 60000 by this value: 60000 / 666.67 ≈ 89.99\n3. Round to nearest 50 shares: 89.99 → 100",
  "Answer": "100 shares",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- From the table, the dividend yield for 2007 is **1.4%**.
- The dividend yield is the annual dividend per share divided by the fair market value (FMV) of the share.
- Mathematically, this is expressed as:
- Rearranging to solve for the annual dividend per share:
- Given:
- Dividend Yield (2007) = 1.4% = 0.014 (in decimal form)
- FMV per Share = $2,000
- Calculation:
- The annual dividend per share is **$28**.
- If the plan grants shares based on this dividend, the number of shares received would be equal to the annual dividend per share (assuming a 1:1 ratio of shares to dividend payouts).
- 89.99 is closer to 100 than to 50, so the rounded value is 100 shares.
- The dividend yield (1.4%) from the table is not directly used in this calculation, as the formula is based on FMV. However, if the question had asked about the dividend per share, the dividend yield would have been relevant.
