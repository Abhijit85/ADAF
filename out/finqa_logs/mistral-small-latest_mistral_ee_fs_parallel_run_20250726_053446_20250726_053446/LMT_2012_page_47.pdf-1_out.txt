=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the growth rate in operating profit for space systems in 2012?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the operating profit for 2012 and 2011 from the table: 2012 Operating Profit = 1083 million, 2011 Operating Profit = 1063 million. 2. Calculate the difference: 1083 - 1063 = 20 million. 3. Calculate the growth rate: (20 / 1063) × 100 ≈ 1.88%.",
  "Answer": "1.88%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2012 Operating Profit = 1,083
- 2011 Operating Profit = 1,063
- Difference = 1,083 - 1,063 = 20
- Growth Rate = (Difference / 2011 Operating Profit) × 100
- Growth Rate = (20 / 1,063) × 100 ≈ 1.88%
- 2012 Operating Profit = 1,083 million
- 2011 Operating Profit = 1,063 million
- Difference = 1,083 - 1,063 = 20 million
- Growth Rate = (Difference / 2011 Operating Profit) × 100
- Growth Rate = (20 / 1,063) × 100 ≈ 1.88%
