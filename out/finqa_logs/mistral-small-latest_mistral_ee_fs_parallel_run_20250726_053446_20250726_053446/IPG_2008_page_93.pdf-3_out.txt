=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the total percentage decrease in future contingent acquisition obligations payable in cash from 2009-2013?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the total contingent acquisition payments for 2009 and 2013 from the table: 2009: $79.3 million, 2013: $75.9 million. 2. Calculate the difference: $79.3 million - $75.9 million = $3.4 million. 3. Calculate the percentage decrease: ($3.4 million / $79.3 million) × 100 ≈ 4.29%.",
  "Answer": "4.29%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2009: $79.3 million
- 2013: $75.9 million
- Difference = 2009 - 2013 = $79.3 - $75.9 = $3.4 million
- Percentage Decrease = (Difference / 2009) × 100
- Percentage Decrease = ($3.4 / $79.3) × 100 ≈ 4.29%
- Difference = 2009 - 2013 = $79.3 million - $75.9 million = $3.4 million
- Percentage Decrease = (Difference / 2009) × 100
- Percentage Decrease = ($3.4 million / $79.3 million) × 100 ≈ 4.29%
