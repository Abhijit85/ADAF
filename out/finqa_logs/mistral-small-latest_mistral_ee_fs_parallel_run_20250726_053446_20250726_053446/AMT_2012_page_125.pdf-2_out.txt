=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "for the mtn deal , what was the total post closing adjustments , in millions?",
  "Calculation": "The text context indicates the MTN Uganda deal had an initial purchase price of $171.5 million, which was increased to $173.2 million subject to post-closing adjustments. The difference between these amounts is $1.7 million. The table data pertains to a different acquisition and is not applicable here.",
  "Answer": "$1.7 million",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The table provided in the financial context is for a different acquisition (Germany acquisition), not the MTN Uganda deal. Thus, the table data is not directly applicable to the MTN Uganda deal.
- The text does not provide the final post-closing adjustments amount, only that the purchase price was subject to such adjustments. The $1.7 million is the difference between the initial and subsequent purchase price, but the final post-closing adjustments may differ if additional adjustments were made later. If more precise data is needed, the final post-closing adjustments amount should be provided in the financial documents.
