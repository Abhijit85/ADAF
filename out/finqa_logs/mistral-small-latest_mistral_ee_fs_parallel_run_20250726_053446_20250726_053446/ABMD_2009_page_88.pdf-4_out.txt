=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what portion of the last payment for the final milestone was paid through the issuance of common stock?",
  "Calculation": "Total Final Milestone Payment: $5833334\nCash Payment: $1800000\nStock Payment: $5833334 - $1800000 = $4033334\nPortion Paid via Common Stock: $4033334 / $5833334 ≈ 0.6915 (or 69.15%)",
  "Answer": "69.15%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Given as **$5,833,334**.
- **$1.8 million** (or **$1,800,000**).
- **$5,833,334 - $1,800,000 = $4,033,334** (paid via stock issuance).
- **$4,033,334 / $5,833,334 ≈ 0.6915** (or **69.15%**).
- If the **value of the issued shares** (e.g., stock price at issuance) were provided, we could verify the stock payment amount more precisely. However, the text does not specify this, so we rely on the given numbers.
