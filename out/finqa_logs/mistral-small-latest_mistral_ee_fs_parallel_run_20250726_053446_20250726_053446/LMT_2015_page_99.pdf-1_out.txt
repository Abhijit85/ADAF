=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the change in the total long-term debt net from 2014 to 2015 in millions",
  "Calculation": "2015 Total long-term debt net ($15261 million) - 2014 Total long-term debt net ($6142 million) = $9119 million",
  "Answer": "9119 million",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Change = 2015 Total long-term debt net - 2014 Total long-term debt net
- Change = $15,261 million - $6,142 million
- Change = $9,119 million.
