=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the estimated total cost to replace the annuities the company was liable for in 2017",
  "Calculation": "144618 (Prudential) + 34444 (Unaffiliated) = 179062",
  "Answer": "$179062",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The Prudential Insurance Company of America: $144,618 (2017), $146,507 (2016)
- Unaffiliated life insurance company: $34,444 (2017), $33,860 (2016)
- The company has entered into annuity agreements with:
- The company is **contingently liable** if either insurer fails to make payments.
- The table provides estimated costs for these annuities in 2017.
- **The Prudential Insurance Company of America (2017)**: $144,618
- **Unaffiliated life insurance company (2017)**: $34,444
---
- If the table had different labels or if the figures represented something other than replacement costs, further clarification would be needed.
- However, the text explicitly states that the table represents the **"estimated cost to replace all such annuities,"** confirming the interpretation.
