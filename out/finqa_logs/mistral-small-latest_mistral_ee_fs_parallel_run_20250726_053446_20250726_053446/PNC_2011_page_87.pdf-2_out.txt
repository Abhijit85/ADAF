=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the average , in millions , home equity line of credit with balloon payments with draw periods from 2012 to 2016?",
  "Calculation": "Sum of balloon payment values from 2012 to 2015: $306 (2012) + $44 (2013) + $60 (2014) + $100 (2015) = $510 million. Average = $510 / 4 = $127.5 million.",
  "Answer": "127.5",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2012: $904 million
- 2013: $1,211 million
- 2014: $2,043 million
- 2015: $1,988 million
- 2016 and thereafter: $6,961 million (Note: "2016 and thereafter" is not included in the 2012-2016 average, so we exclude this value.)
