✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what percentage of total future minimum lease payments are due in 2007?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the part (2007 lease payments) = $769000\n2. Identify the base (total future minimum lease payments) = $4578000\n3. Calculate the ratio: (769000 / 4578000)\n4. Perform the division: 769000 ÷ 4578000 ≈ 0.168\n5. Convert to percentage: 0.168 × 100 ≈ 16.8%",
  "Answer": "16.8%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The table data provided in the question does not explicitly list the "2007 lease payments" or "total future minimum lease payments." These values would need to be confirmed from the actual table data in the financial statements. The calculation assumes the values are correct as stated in the question.
