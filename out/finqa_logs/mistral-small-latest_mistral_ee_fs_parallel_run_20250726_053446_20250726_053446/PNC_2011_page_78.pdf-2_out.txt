=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "how much of an increase , in millions , to the pension expenses did the three changes in assumption cause?",
  "Calculation": "To find the total increase in pension expenses due to the three changes in assumptions, we sum the individual increases: $23 million (0.5% decrease in discount rate) + $18 million (0.5% decrease in expected long-term return on assets) + $2 million (0.5% increase in compensation rate) = $43 million",
  "Answer": "$43 million",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 0.5% decrease in discount rate: $23 million
- 0.5% decrease in expected long-term return on assets: $18 million
- 0.5% increase in compensation rate: $2 million
