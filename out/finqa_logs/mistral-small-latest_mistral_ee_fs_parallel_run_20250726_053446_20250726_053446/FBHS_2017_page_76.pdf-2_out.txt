=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage growth in the total long-term debt from 2016 to 2017",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the total long-term debt for 2016 and 2017 from the table: 2017: $1507.6 million, 2016: $1431.1 million. 2. Calculate the difference: $1507.6 - $1431.1 = $76.5 million. 3. Calculate the percentage growth: ($76.5 / $1431.1) × 100 ≈ 5.34%.",
  "Answer": "5.34%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2017: $1,507.6 million
- 2016: $1,431.1 million
- Difference = $1,507.6 - $1,431.1 = $76.5 million
- Percentage Growth = (Difference / 2016 Value) × 100
- Percentage Growth = ($76.5 / $1,431.1) × 100 ≈ 5.34%
- Difference = $1,507.6 million - $1,431.1 million = $76.5 million
- Percentage Growth = (Difference / 2016 Value) × 100
- Percentage Growth = ($76.5 million / $1,431.1 million) × 100 ≈ 5.34%
