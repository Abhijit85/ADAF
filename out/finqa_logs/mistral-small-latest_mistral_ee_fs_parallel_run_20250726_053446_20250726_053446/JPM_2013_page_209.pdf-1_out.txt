{
  "Question": "in 2013 what was the net trading assets 2013 derivative receivables to the trading liabilities 2013 derivative payable",
  "Calculation": "Net Trading Assets = 2013 Derivative Receivables - 2013 Derivative Payables = $72629 million - $64553 million = $8076 million. Ratio = Net Trading Assets / Trading Liabilities (Derivative Payables) = $8076 million / $64553 million ≈ 0.125",
  "Answer": "0.125",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2013 derivative receivables = $72,629 million
- 2013 derivative payables = $64,553 million
- Ratio = 2013 derivative receivables / 2013 derivative payables
- Ratio = 72,629 / 64,553 ≈ 1.125
- Net Trading Assets = Derivative Receivables - Derivative Payables
- Net Trading Assets = $72,629 million - $64,553 million
- Net Trading Assets = $8,076 million
- Ratio = Net Trading Assets / Trading Liabilities (Derivative Payables)
- Ratio = $8,076 million / $64,553 million
- Ratio ≈ 0.125
- None, as all necessary data was provided in the table and the text context clarified the definitions of trading assets and liabilities.
