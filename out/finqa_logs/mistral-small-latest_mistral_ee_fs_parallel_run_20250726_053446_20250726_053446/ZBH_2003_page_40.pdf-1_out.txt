=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the difference in operating profit for the americas as a percentage of net sales between 2001 and 2003?",
  "Calculation": "Difference = Americas 2003 (51.2%) - Americas 2001 (47.4%) = 3.8%",
  "Answer": "3.8%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Americas 2003: 51.2%
- Americas 2001: 47.4%
- 2001: 47.4%
- 2003: 51.2%
- Difference = 51.2% - 47.4% = 3.8%
