=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the estimated price of hologic common stock used in the acquisition of suros?",
  "Calculation": "The value of Hologic common stock used in the acquisition is explicitly stated as $106500 for 4600 shares. The price per share is calculated as: $106500 / 4600 = $23.1522, which rounds to $23.15 per share.",
  "Answer": "$23.15 per share",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- None. The text explicitly provides the value of the shares issued and the number of shares, allowing for a direct calculation.
