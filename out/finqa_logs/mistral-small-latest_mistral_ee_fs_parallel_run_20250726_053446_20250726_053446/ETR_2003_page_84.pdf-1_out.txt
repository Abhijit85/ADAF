Answer Echoes:
- The text states: *"the annual long-term debt maturities (excluding lease obligations) for debt outstanding as of December 31, 2003, for the next five years are as follows:"*
- However, the actual table data is missing, so we must rely on the text for the next 24 months (2 years).
- The text does not explicitly list the debt maturities for the next 24 months, but it implies that the debt maturities are structured over the next five years.
- **Entergy Louisiana Bonds:**
- Bonds were purchased on October 1, 2003 (per point (d)), but they have not been remarketed yet.
- The purchase was funded by cash and short-term borrowing, but this does not directly contribute to long-term debt due in the next 24 months.
- **St. Charles Parish Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds:**
- Remarketed on June 1, 2002, with a reset interest rate of 4.9% through May 2005 (per point (e)).
- These bonds are due in 2030, so they do not mature in the next 24 months.
- **Notes Payable to NYPA:**
- Seven annual installments of ~$108M starting one year from closing (November 2000).
- Eight annual installments of $20M starting eight years from closing.
- A $102M prepayment was made in July 2003, reducing the outstanding balance.
- The next payment would be due in November 2004 (~$108M) and November 2005 (~$108M).
- **Additional Liability for Indian Point 2:**
- $10M per year for 10 years, starting September 2003.
- This would contribute $10M in 2004 and $10M in 2005.
- The fair value excludes lease obligations, long-term DOE obligations, and other long-term debt but includes debt due within one year.
- This suggests that debt due within 24 months (2 years) is included in the calculation.
- The table provided does not contain data for 2003 or explicit information about long-term debt due in the next 24 months.
- Therefore, we must rely solely on the text for this calculation.
- **2004 Payment:** $108M (due November 2004)
- **2005 Payment:** $108M (due November 2005)
- **Total:** $108M + $108M = **$216M**
- **2004 Payment:** $10M (due September 2004)
- **2005 Payment:** $10M (due September 2005)
- **Total:** $10M + $10M = **$20M**
- **Notes Payable to NYPA:** $216M
- **Indian Point 2 Liability:** $20M
- **Total:** $216M + $20M = **$236M**
