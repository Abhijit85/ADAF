=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what percentage of total contractual obligations comes from global headquarters operating leases?",
  "Calculation": "1. Total contractual obligations = $144535\n2. Global headquarters operating leases = $68389\n3. Percentage = (68389 / 144535) × 100 ≈ 47.32%",
  "Answer": "47.32%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Total contractual obligations = $144,535
- Global headquarters operating leases = $68,389
- Ratio = Global headquarters operating leases / Total contractual obligations
- Ratio = $68,389 / $144,535 ≈ 0.4732
- Percentage = 0.4732 × 100 ≈ 47.32%
