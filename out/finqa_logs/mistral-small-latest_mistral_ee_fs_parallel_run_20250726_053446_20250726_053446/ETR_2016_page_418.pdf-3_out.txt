=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "Was the change in net revenue from changes in transmission revenue more significant than the change due to the retail electric price change?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the changes in transmission revenue and retail electric price from the table: Transmission revenue change: $7.0 million, Retail electric price change: $5.4 million. 2. Compare the two values: $7.0 million (transmission revenue) > $5.4 million (retail electric price).",
  "Answer": "Yes, the change in net revenue from transmission revenue ($7.0 million) was more significant than the change due to the retail electric price ($5.4 million).",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Transmission revenue change: $7.0 million
- Retail electric price change: $5.4 million
- $7.0 million (transmission revenue) > $5.4 million (retail electric price)
- Transmission revenue change: $7.0 million
- Retail electric price change: $5.4 million
- $7.0 million (transmission revenue) > $5.4 million (retail electric price)
