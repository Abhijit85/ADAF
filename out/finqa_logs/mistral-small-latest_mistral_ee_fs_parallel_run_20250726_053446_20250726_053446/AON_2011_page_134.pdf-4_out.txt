=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the increase observed in the total revenue during 2010 and 2011?",
  "Calculation": "Increase = 2011 Total Revenue - 2010 Total Revenue = $11287 million - $8512 million = $2775 million",
  "Answer": "$2775 million",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2011 Total Revenue = $11,287
- 2010 Total Revenue = $8,512
- Increase = 2011 Total Revenue - 2010 Total Revenue
- Increase = $11,287 - $8,512
- Increase = $2,775
- Increase = 2011 Total Revenue - 2010 Total Revenue
- Increase = $11,287 million - $8,512 million
- Increase = $2,775 million
