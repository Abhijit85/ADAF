=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the average backlog at year-end from 2013 to 2015",
  "Calculation": "Sum of backlogs: $21400 + $20300 + $17400 = $59100. Average = $59100 / 3 = $19700",
  "Answer": "$19700 million",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2015: $17,400
- 2014: $20,300
- 2013: $21,400
- $21,400 + $20,300 + $17,400 = $59,100 million
- $59,100 / 3 = $19,700 million
