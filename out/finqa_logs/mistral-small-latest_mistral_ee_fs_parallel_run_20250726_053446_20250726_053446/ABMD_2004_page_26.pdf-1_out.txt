=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "for the facility leases that have remaining terms through fiscal 2010 , assuming the annual rent is approximately that of 2003 , what is the remaining total obligation?",
  "Calculation": "Sum of future minimum lease payments for 2005-2009 and Thereafter (including 2010):\n$781 (2005) + $776 (2006) + $769 (2007) + $772 (2008) + $772 (2009) + $708 (Thereafter) = $4578",
  "Answer": "$4578000",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2005: $781
- 2006: $776
- 2007: $769
- 2008: $772
- 2009: $772
- Thereafter (including 2010): $708
- Future minimum lease payments for facility leases (2005–2009 + Thereafter):
- 2005: $781,000
- 2006: $776,000
- 2007: $769,000
- 2008: $772,000
- 2009: $772,000
- Thereafter (including 2010): $708,000
- **Total future minimum lease payments**: $4,578,000 (sum of all listed payments).
- The company has facility leases with terms through fiscal 2010.
- The "Thereafter" category likely includes fiscal 2010 and beyond.
- The company did not exercise an early termination option in 2005.
- $781,000 (2005) + $776,000 (2006) + $769,000 (2007) + $772,000 (2008) + $772,000 (2009) = **$3,870,000**.
- $3,870,000 + $708,000 = **$4,578,000**.
- The question assumes the annual rent is approximately that of 2003 ($823,000). However, the table provides exact future payments, so we use those instead of recalculating based on 2003 rent.
---
- If the question had asked for an estimate based on 2003 rent ($823,000), we would calculate:
- 2005–2009 (5 years) × $823,000 = **$4,115,000**.
- 2010 (assuming same rent) = $823,000.
- **Total = $4,938,000** (but this contradicts the table data, so the table values take precedence).
