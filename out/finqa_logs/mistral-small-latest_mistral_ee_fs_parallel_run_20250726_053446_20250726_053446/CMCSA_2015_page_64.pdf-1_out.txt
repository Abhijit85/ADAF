=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what would the investment income ( loss ) have been in 2015 without the gain from the sale of shares of arris group common stock in 2014?",
  "Calculation": "Adjusted 2015 Investment Income (Loss) = Reported 2015 Income - ARRIS Gain = $81 million - $154 million = -$73 million",
  "Answer": "-$73 million",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2015: $81 million
- 2014: $296 million
- 2013: $576 million
- Investment income (loss), net for 2015: **$81 million**.
- Investment income (loss), net for 2014: **$296 million**.
- Investment income (loss), net for 2013: **$576 million**.
- The reported 2015 investment income was **$81 million**, which included the **$154 million gain**.
- Without this gain, the investment income would have been a **loss of $73 million**, which aligns with the context that the gain was a significant driver of the 2015 figure.
