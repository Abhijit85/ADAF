=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the carrying value of notes due by 2017 ? in millions $ .",
  "Calculation": "Sum of carrying values of notes due by 2017: $1000 (2014) + $750 (2015) + $698 (2017) = $2448",
  "Answer": "$2448 million",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2014 notes: $1,000 million
- 2015 notes: $750 million
- 2017 notes: $698 million
