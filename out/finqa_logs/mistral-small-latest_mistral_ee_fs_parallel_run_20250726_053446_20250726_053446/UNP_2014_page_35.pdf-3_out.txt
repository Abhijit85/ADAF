=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage change in cash provided by operating activities from 2012 to 2013?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify values: 2012 = $6161 million, 2013 = $6823 million. 2. Calculate difference: $6823 - $6161 = $662 million. 3. Calculate percentage change: ($662 / $6161) × 100 ≈ 10.75%.",
  "Answer": "10.75%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2012: $6,161 million
- 2013: $6,823 million
- Difference = $6,823 - $6,161 = $662 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2012 Value) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($662 / $6,161) × 100 ≈ 10.75%
- Difference = $6,823 million - $6,161 million = $662 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2012 Value) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($662 million / $6,161 million) × 100 ≈ 10.75%
