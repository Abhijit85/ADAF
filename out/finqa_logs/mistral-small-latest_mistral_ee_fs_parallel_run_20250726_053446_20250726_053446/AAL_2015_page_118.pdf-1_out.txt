{
  "Question": "on december 31 2013 what was the net profit margin",
  "Calculation": "Net Profit Margin = (Net Income / Revenue) × 100. The required data for December 31, 2013, is not provided in the table or text context.",

Answer Echoes:
- **Net Income (for the period from December 9, 2013, to December 31, 2013)**: Not directly provided in the table, but the calculation for 2015 is shown as (2,526 / 40,678) × 100 ≈ 6.21%. However, the question specifically asks for December 31, 2013, which is not the same as the 2015 data.
- **Revenue (for the period from December 9, 2013, to December 31, 2013)**: Not directly provided in the table.
