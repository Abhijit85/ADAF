=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "as of december 31 , 2015 what was the percentage decline in the gross unrecognized tax benefits from 2014 to 2015",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the gross unrecognized tax benefits at the end of 2014 and 2015 from the table: 2014: $70.1 million, 2015: $47.0 million. 2. Calculate the difference: $47.0 - $70.1 = -$23.1 million. 3. Calculate the percentage decline: (-$23.1 / $70.1) × 100 ≈ -32.95%.",
  "Answer": "-32.95%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2014: $70.1
- 2015: $47.0
- Difference = $47.0 - $70.1 = -$23.1 (a decline of $23.1)
- Percentage Decline = (Difference / 2014 Value) × 100
- Percentage Decline = (-$23.1 / $70.1) × 100 ≈ -32.95%
- Difference = $47.0 million (2015) - $70.1 million (2014) = -$23.1 million
- Percentage Decline = (Difference / 2014 Value) × 100
- Percentage Decline = (-$23.1 million / $70.1 million) × 100 ≈ -32.95%
