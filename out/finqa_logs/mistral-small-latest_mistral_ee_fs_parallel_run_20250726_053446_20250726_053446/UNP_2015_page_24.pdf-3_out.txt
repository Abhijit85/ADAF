=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage change in free cash flow from 2014 to 2015?",
  "Calculation": "1. Free cash flow in 2015 = $524 million\n2. Free cash flow in 2014 = $1504 million\n3. Difference = $524 - $1504 = -$980 million\n4. Percentage Change = (-$980 / $1504) × 100 ≈ -65.15%",
  "Answer": "-65.15%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Free cash flow in 2015 = $524 million
- Free cash flow in 2014 = $1,504 million
- Difference = $524 - $1,504 = -$980 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2014 Value) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-$980 / $1,504) × 100
- Percentage Change ≈ -65.15%
- Difference = $524 million - $1,504 million = -$980 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2014 Value) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-$980 million / $1,504 million) × 100
- Percentage Change ≈ -65.15%
