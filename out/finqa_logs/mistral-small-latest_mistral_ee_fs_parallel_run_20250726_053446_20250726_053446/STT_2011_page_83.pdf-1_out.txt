=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "in 2011 what was the amount of tax related to the unrealized losses reclassifications totaled $ 303 million , or $ 189 million after-tax,",
  "Calculation": "$303 million (pre-tax) - $189 million (after-tax) = $114 million (tax amount)",
  "Answer": "$114 million",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Pre-tax amount = $303 million
- After-tax amount = $189 million
