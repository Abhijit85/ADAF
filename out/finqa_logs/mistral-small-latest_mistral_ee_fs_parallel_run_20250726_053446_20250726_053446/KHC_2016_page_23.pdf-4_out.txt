=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "as of december 31 , 2016 , what percentage of manufacturing and processing facilities are owned?",
  "Calculation": "1. Total owned facilities = 43 (US) + 3 (Canada) + 11 (Europe) + 26 (Rest of World) = 83\n2. Total leased facilities = 2 (US) + 2 (Rest of World) = 4\n3. Total facilities = 83 (owned) + 4 (leased) = 87\n4. Percentage owned = (83 / 87) × 100 ≈ 95.40%",
  "Answer": "95.40%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Owned: 43 (US) + 3 (Canada) + 11 (Europe) + 26 (Rest of World) = 83
- Leased: 2 (US) + 2 (Rest of World) = 4
- Total Facilities = 83 (Owned) + 4 (Leased) = 87
