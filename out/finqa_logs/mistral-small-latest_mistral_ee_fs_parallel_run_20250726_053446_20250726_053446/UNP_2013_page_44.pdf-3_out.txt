=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the net change in the number of environmental sites from 2012 to 2013?",
  "Calculation": "Net change = Open sites at end of 2013 (268) - Open sites at end of 2012 (284) = -16",
  "Answer": "-16 (a decrease of 16 sites)",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Open sites at end of 2013: 268
- Open sites at end of 2012: 284
- Net change = 268 (2013) - 284 (2012) = -16
