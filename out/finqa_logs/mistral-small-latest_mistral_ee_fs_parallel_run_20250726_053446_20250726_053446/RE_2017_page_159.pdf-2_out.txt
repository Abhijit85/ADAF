=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the percentage change in unaffiliated life insurance company from 2016 to 2017?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify values: 2016 = $33860 (thousands), 2017 = $34444 (thousands). 2. Calculate difference: 34444 - 33860 = 584 (thousands). 3. Calculate percentage change: (584 / 33860) × 100 ≈ 1.725%. 4. Round to two decimal places: 1.73%.",
  "Answer": "1.73%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2017: $34,444 (thousands)
- 2016: $33,860 (thousands)
- Difference = 34,444 - 33,860 = 584 (thousands)
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2016 Value) × 100
- Percentage Change = (584 / 33,860) × 100 ≈ 1.725%
