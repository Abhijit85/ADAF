=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage reduction in net sales for shorewood in 2006 from 2005 s",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify net sales from text context: 2006 = $670 million, 2005 = $691 million. 2. Calculate difference: $670 - $691 = -$21 million. 3. Calculate percentage reduction: (|$21| / $691) * 100 ≈ 3.04%.",
  "Answer": "3.04%",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2006 Sales: $2,455 million
- 2005 Sales: $2,245 million
- Difference = 2006 Sales - 2005 Sales = $2,455 - $2,245 = $210 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2005 Sales) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($210 / $2,245) × 100 ≈ 9.35%
