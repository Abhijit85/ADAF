{
  "Question": "what percent decrease for interest income occurred between 2014 and 2015?",
  "Calculation": "1. Base (2014 interest income): $27.4 million\n2. Part (2015 interest income): $22.8 million\n3. Difference = $27.4 - $22.8 = $4.6 million (decrease)\n4. Percentage Decrease = ($4.6 / $27.4) × 100 ≈ 16.79%",
  "Answer": "16.79%",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2014: $(35.5) (10% increase in interest rates)
- 2015: $(33.7) (10% increase in interest rates)
- Base (2014 value): $(35.5)
- Part (2015 value): $(33.7)
- Difference = 2015 value - 2014 value = $(33.7) - $(35.5) = $1.8 (increase, since the negative value is smaller)
- Since the question asks for the percent decrease in the *decrease* (i.e., the absolute value of the negative numbers), we treat the values as positive for calculation:
- Base (2014): 35.5
- Part (2015): 33.7
- Difference = 35.5 - 33.7 = 1.8
- Percentage Decrease = (Difference / Base) × 100 = (1.8 / 35.5) × 100 ≈ 5.07%
- Base (2014 interest income): $27.4 million
- Part (2015 interest income): $22.8 million
- Difference = 2014 value - 2015 value = $27.4 - $22.8 = $4.6 million (decrease)
- Percentage Decrease = (Difference / Base) × 100 = ($4.6 / $27.4) × 100 ≈ 16.79%
