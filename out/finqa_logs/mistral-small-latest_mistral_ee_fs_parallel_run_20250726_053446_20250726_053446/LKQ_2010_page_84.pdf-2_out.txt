=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage change in rental expense for operating leases from 2009 to 2010?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the rental expenses for 2009 and 2010: 2010: $66.9 million, 2009: $57.2 million. 2. Calculate the difference: $66.9 million - $57.2 million = $9.7 million. 3. Calculate the percentage change: ($9.7 million / $57.2 million) * 100 ≈ 16.96%.",
  "Answer": "16.96%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2010: $66.9 million
- 2009: $57.2 million
- Difference = $66.9 million - $57.2 million = $9.7 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2009 Expense) * 100
- Percentage Change = ($9.7 million / $57.2 million) * 100 ≈ 16.96%
