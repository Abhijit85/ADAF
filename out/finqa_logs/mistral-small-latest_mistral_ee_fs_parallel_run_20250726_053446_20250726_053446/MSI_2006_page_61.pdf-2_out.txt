=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "how much did the lease obligations drop from 2004 to 2011?",
  "Calculation": "2004 Lease Obligations (from text): $205 million - 2011 Lease Obligations (from table): $158 million = $47 million",
  "Answer": "$47 million",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2004 Lease Obligations: $351 million (Total for 2004)
- 2011 Lease Obligations: $158 million (2011 column)
- Difference = 2004 Lease Obligations - 2011 Lease Obligations
- Difference = $351 million - $158 million = $193 million
- 2004 Lease Obligations: $205 million (from text)
- 2011 Lease Obligations: $158 million (from table)
- Difference = 2004 Lease Obligations - 2011 Lease Obligations
- Difference = $205 million - $158 million = $47 million
- The table data provided in the question seems to have conflicting information. The text states that the rental expense (net of sublease income) was $205 million in 2004, while the table data suggests a different value ($351 million for 2004). Clarification is needed to resolve this discrepancy. For the purpose of this analysis, the text context is prioritized as it directly states the rental expense for 2004.
