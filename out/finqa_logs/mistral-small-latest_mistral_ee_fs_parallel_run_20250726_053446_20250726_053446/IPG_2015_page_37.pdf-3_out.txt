=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the cash flow statement effect of the change in cash used for working capital from 2013 to 2014?",
  "Calculation": "Difference = Cash used in 2014 - Cash used in 2013 = $(131.1) - $(9.6) = $(131.1) + $9.6 = $(121.5) million",
  "Answer": "-$121.5 million",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Cash used in working capital in 2014: $(131.1) million
- Cash used in working capital in 2013: $(9.6) million
- 2014: $(131.1) million
- 2013: $(9.6) million
- Difference = Cash used in 2014 - Cash used in 2013
- Difference = $(131.1) - $(9.6)
- Difference = $(131.1) + $9.6 (since subtracting a negative is adding)
- Difference = $(121.5) million
