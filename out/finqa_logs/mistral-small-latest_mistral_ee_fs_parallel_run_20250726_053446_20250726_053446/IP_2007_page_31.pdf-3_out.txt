=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the change in net sales in millions in 2007 in billions",
  "Calculation": "2007 Sales ($5245 million) - 2006 Sales ($4925 million) = $320 million. Convert to billions: $320 million = $0.320 billion",
  "Answer": "0.320 billion",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2007 Sales: $5,245 million
- 2006 Sales: $4,925 million
- Change = 2007 Sales - 2006 Sales
- Change = $5,245 million - $4,925 million = $320 million
- $320 million = $0.320 billion
