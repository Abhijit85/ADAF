=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "contract generation revenues were what in millions in 2001?",
  "Calculation": "The value is directly provided in both the table and text as $827 million for 2001 contract generation revenues.",
  "Answer": "$827 million",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- No additional calculations are needed as the value is directly provided in both the text and table data.
- The text provides further breakdowns by region and reasons for changes, but these are not required for this specific question.
- The gross margin percentage for contract generation in 2001 was 33% of revenues, but this is not needed for the revenue figure itself.
