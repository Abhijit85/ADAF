=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage change in rental expense for operating leases from 2008 to 2009?",
  "Calculation": "Percentage Change = ((57.2 - 49.0) / 49.0) * 100 = (8.2 / 49.0) * 100 ≈ 16.73%",
  "Answer": "16.73%",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2008: $49.0 million
- 2009: $57.2 million
- Difference = $57.2 million - $49.0 million = $8.2 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2008 Expense) * 100
- Percentage Change = ($8.2 million / $49.0 million) * 100 ≈ 16.73%
