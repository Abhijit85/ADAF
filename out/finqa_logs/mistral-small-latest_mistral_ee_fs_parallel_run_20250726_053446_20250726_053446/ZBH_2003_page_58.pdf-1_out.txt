✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what percent increase did inventories receive between 2002 and 2003?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify inventories: 2003 = $527.7 million, 2002 = $257.6 million. 2. Calculate difference: $527.7 - $257.6 = $270.1 million. 3. Calculate percentage increase: ($270.1 / $257.6) × 100 ≈ 104.89%.",
  "Answer": "104.89%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2003: $527.7
- 2002: $257.6
- Difference = $527.7 - $257.6 = $270.1
- Percentage Increase = (Difference / 2002 Inventory) × 100
- Percentage Increase = ($270.1 / $257.6) × 100 ≈ 104.89%
- Difference = $527.7 million - $257.6 million = $270.1 million
- Percentage Increase = (Difference / 2002 Inventory) × 100
- Percentage Increase = ($270.1 million / $257.6 million) × 100 ≈ 104.89%
