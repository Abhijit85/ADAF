=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the net change in shares of common stock outstanding from 2013 to 2014 in millions?",
  "Calculation": "Net change = Shares in 2014 - Shares in 2013 = 1951 million - 1945 million = 6 million",
  "Answer": "6 million",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2014: 1,951 million shares
- 2013: 1,945 million shares
- Net change = Shares in 2014 - Shares in 2013
- Net change = 1,951 - 1,945 = 6 million shares
- Net change = Shares in 2014 - Shares in 2013
- Net change = 1,951 million - 1,945 million = 6 million
- The text context mentions that the company had a share repurchase program in 2014, which could have influenced the net change in shares outstanding. However, the exact impact of repurchases is not quantified in the provided data, so the calculation relies solely on the table data.
