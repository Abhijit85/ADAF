=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the percent change in gas customers between 2007 and 2008?",
  "Calculation": "Percent Change = ((93000 - 86000) / 86000) × 100 = (7000 / 86000) × 100 ≈ 8.14%",
  "Answer": "8.14%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Initial (2007) = 86,000 gas customers
- Final (2008) = 93,000 gas customers
- Difference = 93,000 - 86,000 = 7,000
- Percent Change = (Difference / Initial) × 100
- Percent Change = (7,000 / 86,000) × 100 ≈ 8.14%
