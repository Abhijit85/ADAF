✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "by what percentage will the 2019 pre-tax pension and postretirement expense be higher than that of 2018?",
  "Calculation": "1. Difference: $205 million (2019) - $160 million (2018) = $45 million\n2. Percentage Increase: ($45 million / $160 million) × 100 = 28.125%",
  "Answer": "28.13%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2018: 1.61%
- 2019 (assumed same as 2018): 1.61%
- Percentage increase: (1.61% - 1.61%) / 1.61% × 100 = 0%
- 2018: 3.97%
- 2019 (assumed same as 2018): 3.97%
- Percentage increase: (3.97% - 3.97%) / 3.97% × 100 = 0%
