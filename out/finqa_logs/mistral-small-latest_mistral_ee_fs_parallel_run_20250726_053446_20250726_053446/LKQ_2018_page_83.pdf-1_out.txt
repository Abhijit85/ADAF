=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the change in the warranty reserve from 2017 to 2018?",
  "Calculation": "Change = Balance as of December 31, 2018 - Balance as of December 31, 2017 = $23262 - $23151 = $111 (in thousands)",
  "Answer": "$111000",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2018: $23,262
- 2017: $23,151
- Change = 2018 balance - 2017 balance
- Change = $23,262 - $23,151
- Change = $111 (in thousands)
