✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the book to market ratio of the commercial mortgage-backed securities",
  "Calculation": "Book-to-Market Ratio = Book Value / Market Value = 264.9 / 266.3 ≈ 0.995",
  "Answer": "0.995",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The ratio is very close to 1, indicating that the book value and market value of the CMBS are nearly equal.
- This suggests that the CMBS are trading close to their accounting value, which may reflect stable market conditions or conservative accounting practices.
