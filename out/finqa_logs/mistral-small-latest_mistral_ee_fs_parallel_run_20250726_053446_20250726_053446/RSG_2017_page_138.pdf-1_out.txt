✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "in 2017 what was the debt to equity based on the 2017 actual asset allocation",
  "Calculation": "Debt-to-Equity = Debt securities / Equity securities = 70% / 30% = 0.70 / 0.30 ≈ 2.33 (rounded to two decimal places)",
  "Answer": 2.33,
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Debt securities (2017) = 70%
- Equity securities (2017) = 30%
- Debt-to-Equity = Debt securities / Equity securities
- Debt-to-Equity = 70% / 30%
- Debt-to-Equity = 70 / 30 = 2.33 (rounded to two decimal places)
