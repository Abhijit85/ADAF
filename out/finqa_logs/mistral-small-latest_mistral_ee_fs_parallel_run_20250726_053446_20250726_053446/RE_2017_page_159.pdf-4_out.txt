=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the percentage change in the balance of the prudential insurance company of america from 2016 to 2017?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify values: 2016 = $146507 (in thousands), 2017 = $144618 (in thousands). 2. Calculate difference: $144618 - $146507 = -$1889 (in thousands). 3. Calculate percentage change: (-$1889 / $146507) × 100 ≈ -1.29%.",
  "Answer": "-1.29%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2017: $144,618 (in thousands)
- 2016: $146,507 (in thousands)
- Difference = 2017 value - 2016 value = $144,618 - $146,507 = -$1,889 (in thousands)
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2016 value) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-$1,889 / $146,507) × 100 ≈ -1.29%
