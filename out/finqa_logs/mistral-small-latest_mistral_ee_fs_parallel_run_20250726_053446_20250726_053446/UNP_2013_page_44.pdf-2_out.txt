=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the net change in the number of environmental sites from 2011 to 2012?",
  "Calculation": "Net change = Ending balance in 2012 - Ending balance in 2011 = 284 - 285 = -1",
  "Answer": "-1 (a decrease of 1 site)",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Ending balance in 2012: 284
- Ending balance in 2011: 285
