=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what percentage of the total cash purchase price net of cash acquired was represented by goodwill?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the base (total cash purchase price net of cash acquired): $320.1 million\n2. Identify the part (goodwill): $258.9 million\n3. Calculate the percentage: (258.9 / 320.1) × 100\n4. Perform the division: 258.9 ÷ 320.1 ≈ 0.8088\n5. Multiply by 100 to get percentage: 0.8088 × 100 ≈ 80.88%",
