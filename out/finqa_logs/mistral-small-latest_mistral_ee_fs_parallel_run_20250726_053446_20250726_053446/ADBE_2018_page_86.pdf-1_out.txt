=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the percentage change in total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits from 2017 to 2018?",
  "Calculation": "1. 2018 Gross Unrecognized Tax Benefits = $16191 + $60721 = $76912\n2. 2017 Gross Unrecognized Tax Benefits = $3680 + $24927 = $28607\n3. Difference = $76912 - $28607 = $48305\n4. Percentage Change = ($48305 / $28607) × 100 ≈ 168.87%",
  "Answer": "168.87%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2018: Gross increases (prior year) + Gross increases (current year) = $16,191 + $60,721 = $76,912
- 2017: Gross increases (prior year) + Gross increases (current year) = $3,680 + $24,927 = $28,607
- Percentage Change = [(2018 - 2017) / 2017] × 100
- Percentage Change = [($76,912 - $28,607) / $28,607] × 100
- Percentage Change = ($48,305 / $28,607) × 100
- Percentage Change ≈ 168.87%
