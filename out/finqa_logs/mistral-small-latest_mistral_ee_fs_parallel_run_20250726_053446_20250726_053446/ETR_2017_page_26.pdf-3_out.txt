=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the net change in net revenue during 2016?",
  "Calculation": "Net change = 2016 net revenue - 2015 net revenue = $1542 million - $1666 million = -$124 million",
  "Answer": "-$124 million",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Net Change = 2016 Net Revenue - 2015 Net Revenue
- Net Change = $1,542 million - $1,666 million
- Net Change = -$124 million
- The text context explains the reasons for the decrease in net revenue, including lower wholesale energy prices, the amortization of the Palisades below-market PPA, the sale of the Rhode Island State Energy Center, and lower volume in the nuclear fleet due to more refueling outage days and larger exercise of resupply options. However, these details are supplementary and do not affect the arithmetic calculation of the net change.
