=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "Assuming 2010 accrued casualty costs were completely repaired in the following year, what would the repairs and maintenance expense increase to for 2011 in millions?",
  "Calculation": "1. Decrease in accrued casualty costs from 2010 to 2011: 325 - 249 = 76 million\n2. Original repairs and maintenance expense for 2011: 2200 million\n3. Increased repairs and maintenance expense for 2011: 2200 + 76 = 2276 million",
  "Answer": "2276 million",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- **Accrued casualty costs (2010)**: $325 million
- **Accrued casualty costs (2011)**: $249 million
- The accrued casualty costs of $325 million in 2010 were completely repaired in 2011. This means the repairs and maintenance expense for 2011 would include the cost of repairing these accrued casualty costs.
