{
  "Question": "for the five years ended 12/31/2006 what is the performance difference of the class b common stock of united parcel service , inc . and the dow jones transportation average?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the values for United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) and Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJTA) on 12/31/2006: UPS (12/31/06) = $148.92, DJTA (12/31/06) = $182.76. 2. Calculate the difference: Difference = DJTA - UPS = $182.76 - $148.92 = $33.84.",
  "Answer": "$33.84",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- UPS (12/31/06) = $148.92
- DJTA (12/31/06) = $182.76
- Difference = UPS - DJTA = $148.92 - $182.76 = -$33.84
- Difference = DJTA (12/31/06) - UPS (12/31/06)
- Difference = $182.76 - $148.92
- Difference = $33.84
