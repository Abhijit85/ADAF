=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percent of the increase in non-utility nuclear earnings in 2002",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the earnings for 2001 and 2002: 2001 earnings = $128 million, 2002 earnings = $201 million. 2. Calculate the increase in earnings: Increase = $201 million - $128 million = $73 million. 3. Calculate the percentage increase: Percentage increase = ($73 million / $128 million) * 100 ≈ 56.95%.",
  "Answer": "56.95%",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Net MW in operation at December 31
- Generation in GWh for the year
- Capacity factor for the year
- 2001 earnings = $128 million
- 2002 earnings = $201 million
- Increase = 2002 earnings - 2001 earnings = $201 million - $128 million = $73 million
- Percentage increase = (Increase / 2001 earnings) * 100
- Percentage increase = ($73 million / $128 million) * 100 ≈ 56.95%
