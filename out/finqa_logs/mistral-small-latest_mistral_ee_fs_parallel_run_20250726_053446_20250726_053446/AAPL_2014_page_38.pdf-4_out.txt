=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the change in property plant and equipment net from 2012 to 2013 in millions?",
  "Calculation": "Change = Property, plant and equipment, net in 2013 - Property, plant and equipment, net in 2012 = $16597 million - $15452 million = $1145 million",
  "Answer": "$1145 million",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Property, plant and equipment, net in 2013: $16,597 million
- Property, plant and equipment, net in 2012: $15,452 million
- Change = 2013 value - 2012 value = $16,597 - $15,452 = $1,145 million
