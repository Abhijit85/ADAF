=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the operating margin for connected fitness in 2014?",
  "Calculation": "Operating Margin = (Operating Income / Revenue) × 100 = (($13.1) / $19.2) × 100 = -68.23%",
  "Answer": "-68.23%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Operating Income (2014) = $(13.1) million
- Revenue (2014) = $19.2 million
- The negative sign indicates a loss, which aligns with the text describing an "operating loss."
- The calculation is consistent with the provided data and context.
- The result is reasonable given the context of investments and acquisitions in the segment.
