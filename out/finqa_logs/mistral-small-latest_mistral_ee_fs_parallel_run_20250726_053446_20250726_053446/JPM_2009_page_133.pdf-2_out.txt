=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "if there were a 100bp rise in rates , how much more would the impact be on earnings in 2009 vs . 2008?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the impact of a 100bp rise in rates for 2009 and 2008 from the table: 2009: $(554) million, 2008: $672 million. 2. Calculate the difference in impact between 2009 and 2008: Difference = Impact in 2009 - Impact in 2008 = $(554) - $672 = -554 - 672 = -1226 million. 3. The negative sign indicates that the impact in 2009 is $(1226) million more negative (or $(1226) million worse) than in 2008.",
  "Answer": "-$1226 million",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2009: $(554) million
- 2008: $672 million
- Difference = Impact in 2009 - Impact in 2008
- Difference = $(554) - $672
- Difference = -554 - 672 = -1,226 million
- 2009: $(554) million
- 2008: $672 million
- Difference = Impact in 2009 - Impact in 2008
- Difference = $(554) - $672
- Difference = -554 - 672 = -1,226 million
