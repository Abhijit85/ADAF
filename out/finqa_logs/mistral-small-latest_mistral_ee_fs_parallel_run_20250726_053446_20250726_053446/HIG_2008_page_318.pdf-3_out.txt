=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the net change in total statutory capital from 2007 to 2008?",
  "Calculation": "Net Change = 2008 Total - 2007 Total = $13777 million - $15915 million = -$2138 million",
  "Answer": "-$2138 million",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2008 Total: $13,777
- 2007 Total: $15,915
- Net Change = 2008 Total - 2007 Total
- Net Change = $13,777 - $15,915
- Net Change = -$2,138
- Net Change = 2008 Total - 2007 Total
- Net Change = $13,777 million - $15,915 million
- Net Change = -$2,138 million
- The 2008 statutory surplus amounts are estimates, as the respective 2008 statutory filings have not yet been completed.
- The permitted practices increased the 2008 life operations estimated statutory surplus by $987 million, which is included in the 2008 total.
