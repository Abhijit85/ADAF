=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the tax expense related to discontinued operations in 2012?",
  "Calculation": "Tax expense = Pre-tax loss - Post-tax loss = $62 million - $37 million = $25 million (tax benefit)",
  "Answer": "$25 million (tax benefit)",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- If the post-tax loss is smaller than the pre-tax loss, it implies a tax benefit (i.e., the company received a tax benefit from the loss).
- Thus, the tax expense is effectively negative, meaning the company did not incur a tax expense but rather received a tax benefit.
