=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the difference in operating profit for europe as a percentage of net sales between 2001 and 2003?",
  "Calculation": "Difference = 26.3% (2003) - 19.5% (2001) = 6.8%",
  "Answer": "6.8%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2001: 19.5%
- 2003: 26.3%
- Difference = 26.3% - 19.5% = 6.8%
- Difference = 26.3% (2003) - 19.5% (2001) = 6.8%
