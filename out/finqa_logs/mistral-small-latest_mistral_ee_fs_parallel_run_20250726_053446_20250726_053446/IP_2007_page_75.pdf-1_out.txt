=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what percentage of december 31 , 2007 , total future minimum commitments under existing non-cancelable operating leases and purchase obligations were due to purchase obligations for the year of 2008?",
  "Calculation": "1. Total future minimum commitments as of December 31, 2007: $2089 (2008) + $410 (2009) + $362 (2010) + $319 (2011) + $279 (2012) + $1572 (Thereafter) = $4031 million. 2. Purchase obligations for 2008: $1953 million. 3. Percentage = ($1953 / $4031) × 100 ≈ 48.45%.",
  "Answer": "48.45%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Total commitments = $2,089 (2008) + $410 (2009) + $362 (2010) + $319 (2011) + $279 (2012) + $1,572 (Thereafter) = $4,031 million.
- Purchase obligations for 2008 = $1,953 million.
- Percentage = (Purchase obligations for 2008 / Total commitments) × 100
- Percentage = ($1,953 / $4,031) × 100 ≈ 48.45%.
- From the table, the purchase obligations for 2008 are $1,953 million (as specified in the "Purchase obligations (a)" row for 2008).
- Percentage = (Purchase obligations for 2008 / Total commitments) × 100
- Percentage = ($1,953 / $4,031) × 100 ≈ 48.45%.
