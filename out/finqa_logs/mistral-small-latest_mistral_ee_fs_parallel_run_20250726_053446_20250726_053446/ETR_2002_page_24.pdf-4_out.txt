=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the percent change in operating revenues from 2001 to 2002?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify operating revenues for 2001 and 2002:\n   - 2002: $1200.0 million\n   - 2001: $789.0 million\n2. Calculate the difference:\n   - Difference = $1200.0 million - $789.0 million = $411.0 million\n3. Calculate the percent change:\n   - Percent Change = ($411.0 million / $789.0 million) × 100 ≈ 52.09%",
  "Answer": "52.09%",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2002 Generation in GWh: 29,953
- 2001 Generation in GWh: 22,614
- 2002: 29,953 GWh
- 2001: 22,614 GWh
- Difference = 29,953 - 22,614 = 7,339 GWh
- Percent Change = (Difference / 2001 Value) × 100
- Percent Change = (7,339 / 22,614) × 100 ≈ 32.45%
- 2002: $1.2 billion = $1,200.0 million
- 2001: $789.0 million
- Difference = $1,200.0 million - $789.0 million = $411.0 million
- Percent Change = (Difference / 2001 Value) × 100
- Percent Change = ($411.0 million / $789.0 million) × 100 ≈ 52.09%
- The table data provided (Generation in GWh) is not directly relevant to the operating revenues of non-utility nuclear, as the text explicitly states the operating revenue figures. Thus, the table data is not used in this calculation.
