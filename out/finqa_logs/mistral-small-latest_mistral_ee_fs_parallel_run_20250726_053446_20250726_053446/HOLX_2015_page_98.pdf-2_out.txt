=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the expected growth rate in amortization expense from 2016 to 2017?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify amortization expenses: 2016 = $377.0 million, 2017 = $365.6 million. 2. Calculate difference: $365.6 - $377.0 = -$11.4 million. 3. Compute growth rate: (-$11.4 / $377.0) × 100 ≈ -2.998%. 4. Round to two decimal places: -3.00%.",
  "Answer": "-3.00%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2016: $377.0
- 2017: $365.6
- Difference = $365.6 - $377.0 = -$11.4
- Growth Rate = (Difference / 2016 Value) × 100
- Growth Rate = (-$11.4 / $377.0) × 100 ≈ -2.998%
- Difference = 2017 Value - 2016 Value
- Difference = $365.6 - $377.0 = -$11.4 million
- Growth Rate = (Difference / 2016 Value) × 100
- Growth Rate = (-$11.4 / $377.0) × 100 ≈ -2.998%
- Growth Rate ≈ -3.00%
