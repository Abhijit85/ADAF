=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the growth rate in the number of stores during 2012?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the relevant values:\n   - Ending Stores in 2012: 3576\n   - Ending Stores in 2011: 3460\n2. Calculate the difference:\n   - Difference = 3576 - 3460 = 116\n3. Calculate the growth rate:\n   - Growth Rate = (Difference / Ending Stores in 2011) × 100\n   - Growth Rate = (116 / 3460) × 100 ≈ 3.35%",
  "Answer": "3.35%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Ending Stores in 2012: 3,576
- Ending Stores in 2011: 3,460
- Difference = 3,576 - 3,460 = 116
- Growth Rate = (Difference / Ending Stores in 2011) × 100
- Growth Rate = (116 / 3,460) × 100 ≈ 3.35%
- Difference = 3,576 (2012) - 3,460 (2011) = 116 stores
- Growth Rate = (Difference / Ending Stores in 2011) × 100
- Growth Rate = (116 / 3,460) × 100 ≈ 3.35%
