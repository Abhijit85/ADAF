=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "in december 2011 what was the ratio of the receivables to the credit facility outstanding",
  "Calculation": "Receivables (2011) = -118415 (from table)\nCredit Facility Outstanding (2011) = 50000000 (from text)\nRatio = Receivables / Credit Facility Outstanding = -118415 / 50000000 = -0.0023683 (or -0.237%)",
  "Answer": "-0.237%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Receivables (2011) = ($118,415) (negative value, likely indicating a deficit or credit facility outstanding).
- Credit facility outstanding (2011) = Not explicitly provided in the table.
- The negative receivables value suggests a deficit or credit facility usage, but the exact nature (e.g., whether it represents a payable to the money pool or another liability) would require further clarification from the financial statements (Note 4, as referenced in the text).
