=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the change in ssa 2019s revenues from the sale of non-petroleum merchandise in 2004 , compared with in 2003 , in billions?",
  "Calculation": "2004 revenue ($2.3 billion) - 2003 revenue ($2.2 billion) = $0.1 billion",
  "Answer": "$0.1 billion",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2004: $2.3 billion
- 2003: $2.2 billion
- Change = 2004 revenue - 2003 revenue
- Change = $2.3 billion - $2.2 billion
- Change = $0.1 billion
