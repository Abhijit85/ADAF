=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what were the remaining mondovi net assets acquired following the sale of certain excess assets from the deal , in thousands?",
  "Calculation": "Initial Net Assets Acquired: $1042661 (from table) - Excess Assets Sold: $170800 (from text) = Remaining Net Assets: $871861",
  "Answer": "$871861",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- **Net assets acquired (Robert Mondavi)**: $1,042,661 (in thousands)
- **Excess assets sold**: The table does not provide the value of the excess assets sold.
- The company sold certain acquired vineyard properties and related assets, realizing **$170.8 million** in net proceeds from these sales during the year ended February 28, 2006.
- The text states that **no gain or loss was recognized** upon the sale of these assets, implying the proceeds were equal to the book value of the sold assets.
---
- The table does not explicitly state the value of the excess assets sold, but the text provides the net proceeds from their sale ($170.8 million). Since no gain or loss was recognized, this amount is used as the value of the sold assets. If further clarification on the book value of the sold assets were provided, the calculation could be refined. However, the current approach is consistent with the given information.
