=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "in millions , what was the change in the estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected between december 2017 and december 2016?",
  "Calculation": "Change = Sensitivity (2017) - Sensitivity (2016) = $35 million - $25 million = $10 million",
  "Answer": "$10 million",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Change = Sensitivity (2017) - Sensitivity (2016)
- Change = $35 million - $25 million
- Change = $10 million
