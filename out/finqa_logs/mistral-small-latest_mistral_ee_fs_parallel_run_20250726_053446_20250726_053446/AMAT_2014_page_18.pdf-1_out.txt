  "Question": "what is the growth rate in sales from 2013 to 2014?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the total sales for 2013 and 2014 from the table: 2014 Total Sales = $2917 million, 2013 Total Sales = $2372 million. 2. Calculate the difference in sales between 2014 and 2013: Difference = $2917 - $2372 = $545 million. 3. Calculate the growth rate using the formula: Growth Rate = (Difference / 2013 Sales) × 100. 4. Growth Rate = ($545 / $2372) × 100 ≈ 22.98%.",
  "Answer": "22.98%",

}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2014 Total Sales = $2,917 million
- 2013 Total Sales = $2,372 million
- Difference = $2,917 - $2,372 = $545 million
- Growth Rate = (Difference / 2013 Sales) × 100
- Growth Rate = ($545 / $2,372) × 100 ≈ 22.98%
- Difference = $2,917 million - $2,372 million = $545 million
- Growth Rate = (Difference / 2013 Sales) × 100
- Growth Rate = ($545 million / $2,372 million) × 100 ≈ 22.98%
