=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "for us federal purposes , how many years are currently involved in irs controversies?",
  "Calculation": "The text explicitly states the IRS controversies span from 1999 to 2013. The calculation is 2013 - 1999 + 1 = 15 years.",
  "Answer": 15,
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The table covers balances and changes from December 31, 2011, to December 31, 2014.
- The "Decreases based on tax positions related to prior periods" and "Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities" indicate resolutions of IRS controversies.
- The "Decreases based on tax positions related to prior periods" and "Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities" for each year imply that the controversies span the years leading up to the current year in the table.
- For example, in 2014, the decreases relate to prior periods, meaning the controversies could involve years before 2014.
- The earliest year in the table is 2011, and the latest is 2014.
- The "prior periods" in 2014 could include 2013, 2012, and 2011.
- Therefore, the controversies span from 2011 to 2014, which is a total of 4 years.
- Start Year: 2011
- End Year: 2014
- Number of Years: 2014 - 2011 + 1 = 4
- The controversies span multiple years, with the earliest year being 1999 and the latest being 2013.
- Earliest year: 1999
- Latest year: 2013
- 2013 - 1999 + 1 = 15 years.
- None, as the text explicitly provides the range of years involved in IRS controversies.
