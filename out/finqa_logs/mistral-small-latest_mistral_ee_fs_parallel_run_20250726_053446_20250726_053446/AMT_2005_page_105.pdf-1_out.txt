✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "in 2005 what was the percentage of the federal nol set to expire between 2016 to 2020",
  "Calculation": "Percentage = (Federal NOL for 2016-2020 / Total Federal NOL) × 100 = ($397691 / $2157503) × 100 ≈ 18.44%",
  "Answer": "18.44%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Federal NOL for 2016 to 2020 = $397,691
- Total federal NOL (2005) = $2,157,503
