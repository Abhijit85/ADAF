✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the percent of available potential to increase the multi-currency line of credit",
  "Calculation": "1. Current Line of Credit: $5.0 billion\n2. Maximum Potential Line of Credit: $7.0 billion\n3. Available Increase: $7.0 billion - $5.0 billion = $2.0 billion\n4. Percentage of Available Potential Increase: (2.0 / 7.0) * 100 ≈ 28.57%",
  "Answer": "28.57%",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
---
- The table provided does not contain any information about the line of credit, so the answer is derived solely from the text context.
- If the line of credit has already been partially utilized, the available increase would be adjusted accordingly, but the text does not indicate any current utilization.
