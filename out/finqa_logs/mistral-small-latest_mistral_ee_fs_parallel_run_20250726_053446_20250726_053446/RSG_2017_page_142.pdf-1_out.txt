=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "as part of the employee stock purchase plan what was the percent of the decline in issuance under this plan from 2016 to 2017",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the number of shares issued in 2016 and 2017 from text context: 2016: 130085 shares, 2017: 113941 shares. 2. Calculate the difference in issuances: 113941 - 130085 = -16144 shares (a decline of 16144 shares). 3. Calculate the percentage decline: (-16144 / 130085) × 100 ≈ -12.41%. Since the question asks for the 'percent of the decline,' we take the absolute value: 12.41%.",
  "Answer": "12.41%",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2016: 8.4 million shares
- 2017: 9.6 million shares
- Difference = 9.6 - 8.4 = 1.2 million shares
- Percentage change = (Difference / 2016 value) × 100
- Percentage change = (1.2 / 8.4) × 100 ≈ 14.29%
- Difference = 2017 issuance - 2016 issuance
- Difference = 113,941 - 130,085 = -16,144 shares (a decline of 16,144 shares)
- Percentage decline = (Difference / 2016 issuance) × 100
- Percentage decline = (-16,144 / 130,085) × 100 ≈ -12.41%
- **Percentage decline = 12.41%**
