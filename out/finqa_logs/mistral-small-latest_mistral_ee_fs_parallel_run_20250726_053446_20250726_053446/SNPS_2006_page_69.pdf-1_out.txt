✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what percentage of the total purchase price is represented by intangible assets?",
  "Calculation": "Percentage = (Intangible Assets / Total Purchase Price) * 100 = (8.5 / 15.7) * 100 ≈ 54.14%",
  "Answer": "54.14%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```
