{
  "Question": "During 2008, what was the change in average realized price for synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil between the end of 2007 and the end of 2008, per barrel?",
  "Calculation": "The change from the 2008 average to the end of 2008 is calculated as: $24.97 (end of 2008) - $91.90 (2008 average) = -$66.93. The change from end of 2007 to end of 2008 cannot be calculated without the end-of-2007 price.",
  "Answer": "The change in average realized price from the 2008 average to the end of 2008 was a decrease of $66.93 per barrel. The change from the end of 2007 to the end of 2008 cannot be calculated without the end-of-2007 price.",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- End of 2008 price: $24.97 per barrel.
- Average 2008 price: $91.90 per barrel.
- The change is calculated as:
- This represents a **decrease of $66.93 per barrel** from the 2008 average to the end of 2008.
- The text explains that the end-of-year price was impacted by a "heavier yield in December and a seasonal decrease in the value of our heavy output." This justifies the sharp decline from the 2008 average.
- The exact average realized price at the end of 2007 is not provided in the text or table. Without this, we cannot calculate the full change from end of 2007 to end of 2008. The question asks for the change between these two points, but only the 2008 average and end-of-year price are available.
