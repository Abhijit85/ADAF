=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the ratio of the 2016 hedged gallons to 2017",
  "Calculation": "Ratio = 27000000 / 12000000 = 2.25",
  "Answer": "2.25",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2016 Gallons Hedged = 27,000,000
- 2017 Gallons Hedged = 12,000,000
- Ratio = 27,000,000 / 12,000,000
- Ratio = 2.25
- Ratio = 2016 Gallons Hedged / 2017 Gallons Hedged
- Ratio = 27,000,000 / 12,000,000
- Ratio = 2.25
