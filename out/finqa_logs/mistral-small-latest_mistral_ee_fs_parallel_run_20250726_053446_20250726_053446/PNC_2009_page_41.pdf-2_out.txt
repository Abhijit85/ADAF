✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage gain recognized on the commercial mortgages held for sale in 2009",
  "Calculation": "The percentage gain recognized is calculated by dividing the net gains recognized on sales ($107 million) by the sales of commercial mortgages held for sale ($300 million), then multiplying by 100. The calculation is: (107 / 300) * 100 = 35.67%.",
  "Answer": "35.67%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Fair value of commercial mortgages at Dec. 31, 2009: $1,050 million
- Fair value of commercial mortgages at Dec. 31, 2008: $1,401 million
- Difference = $1,050 - $1,401 = -$351 million (a loss, not a gain)
- Percentage change = (Difference / 2008 value) × 100
- Percentage change = (-$351 / $1,401) × 100 ≈ -25.05%
- Net gains recognized on commercial mortgages held for sale in 2009: $107 million
- Sales of commercial mortgages held for sale in 2009: $0.3 billion ($300 million)
- The question asks for the percentage gain recognized on the commercial mortgages held for sale in 2009.
- The net gains recognized in 2009 were $107 million.
- The sales of commercial mortgages held for sale in 2009 were $300 million.
- Percentage gain = (Net gains / Sales) × 100
- Percentage gain = ($107 million / $300 million) × 100 ≈ 35.67%
- The fair value decreased from $1,401 million to $1,050 million, which is a loss of $351 million (as shown in the table data).
- However, the question specifically asks for the "percentage gain recognized," which aligns with the net gains recognized on sales, not the fair value change.
- Clarification on whether the question refers to the percentage gain based on sales or the fair value change. The answer provided is based on the net gains recognized on sales, which is the more likely interpretation given the phrasing of the question.
