=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the difference between the high and low aeco natural gas sales index?",
  "Calculation": "Difference = High - Low = $11.34 - $5.42 = $5.92",
  "Answer": "$5.92",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- High: $11.34 (July 1)
- Low: $5.42 (September 19)
- Difference = High - Low = $11.34 - $5.42 = $5.92
- High: $11.34
- Low: $5.42
- Difference = High - Low = $11.34 - $5.42 = $5.92
