{
  "Question": "what amount of long-term debt is due in the next 36 months for entergy corporation as of december 31 , 2013 , in millions?",
  "Calculation": "Unable to calculate due to missing data. Required: Sum of long-term debt maturities for 2014, 2015, and 2016 from table. Exclude lease obligations ($246 million) and long-term DOE obligations ($181 million) as per text context.",

Answer Echoes:
- The table shows financial amounts (in thousands) for the years 2014 to 2018, but it does not specify what these amounts represent (e.g., revenue, expenses, debt, etc.). Since the table is not accessible, we cannot extract the exact numbers for long-term debt maturities.
- The exact amounts of long-term debt maturities for 2014, 2015, and 2016 are needed to calculate the total debt due in the next 36 months. These amounts should be provided in the table or additional text context.
- The specific amounts of long-term debt maturities for 2014, 2015, and 2016 (in millions) are needed to perform the calculation. These amounts should be provided in the table or additional text context.
