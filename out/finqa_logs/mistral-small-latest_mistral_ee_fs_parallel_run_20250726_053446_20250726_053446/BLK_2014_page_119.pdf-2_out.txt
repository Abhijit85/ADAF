=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the fair value of all notes due by 2019 ? in millions $ .",
  "Calculation": "Sum of fair values: $753 (2015) + $785 (2017) + $1134 (2019) = $2672 million",
  "Answer": "$2672 million",

}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Fair value of 1.375% Notes due 2015: $753 million
- Fair value of 6.25% Notes due 2017: $785 million
- Fair value of 5.00% Notes due 2019: $1,134 million
- $753 million (2015) + $785 million (2017) + $1,134 million (2019)
- $753 + $785 = $1,538
- $1,538 + $1,134 = $2,672
