=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the growth rate in total shipment volume from 2010 to 2011?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify shipment volumes: 2010 = 724.4 million, 2011 = 734.6 million. 2. Calculate difference: 734.6 - 724.4 = 10.2 million. 3. Compute growth rate: (10.2 / 724.4) × 100 ≈ 1.41%.",
  "Answer": "1.41%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2010: 724.4 million
- 2011: 734.6 million
- Difference = 734.6 - 724.4 = 10.2 million
- Growth Rate = (Difference / 2010 value) × 100
- Growth Rate = (10.2 / 724.4) × 100 ≈ 1.41%
- Difference = 734.6 million - 724.4 million = 10.2 million
- Growth Rate = (Difference / 2010 value) × 100
- Growth Rate = (10.2 / 724.4) × 100 ≈ 1.41%
