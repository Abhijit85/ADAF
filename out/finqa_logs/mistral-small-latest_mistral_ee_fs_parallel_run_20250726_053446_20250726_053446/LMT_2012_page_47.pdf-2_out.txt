{
  "Question": "what was the ratio of the decreases in the net sales to the operating profit for mst from 2010 to 2011",
  "Calculation": "Decrease in Net Sales = $8268 - $8161 = $107 million; Decrease in Operating Profit = $1030 - $1063 = -$33 million (absolute value $33); Ratio = $107 / $33 ≈ 3.24",
  "Answer": "3.24",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Net Sales (2010) = $8,268
- Net Sales (2011) = $8,161
- Decrease in Net Sales = Net Sales (2010) - Net Sales (2011)
- Decrease in Net Sales = $8,268 - $8,161 = $107
- Operating Profit (2010) = $1,030
- Operating Profit (2011) = $1,063
- Decrease in Operating Profit = Operating Profit (2010) - Operating Profit (2011)
- Decrease in Operating Profit = $1,030 - $1,063 = -$33 (Note: This is an increase, but we take the absolute value for the ratio)
- Absolute Decrease in Operating Profit = $33
- Ratio = (Decrease in Net Sales) / (Decrease in Operating Profit)
- Ratio = $107 / $33 ≈ 3.24
- From the table data (assuming the table provides the exact numbers for 2010 and 2011):
- Net Sales (2010) = $8,268 million
- Net Sales (2011) = $8,161 million
- Operating Profit (2010) = $1,030 million
- Operating Profit (2011) = $1,063 million
- Net Sales (2010) - Net Sales (2011) = $8,268 - $8,161 = $107 million
- (Note: The text states a $311 million decrease, but the table shows a $107 million decrease. This discrepancy suggests the table may not align with the text. For consistency, we will use the table data as it provides exact numbers.)
- Operating Profit (2010) - Operating Profit (2011) = $1,030 - $1,063 = -$33 million
- Absolute Decrease in Operating Profit = $33 million (since the operating profit increased, we take the absolute value for the ratio).
- Ratio = (Decrease in Net Sales) / (Decrease in Operating Profit)
- Ratio = $107 / $33 ≈ 3.24
- The text mentions a $311 million decrease in net sales, but the table shows a $107 million decrease. Clarification is needed to resolve this discrepancy. If the text is correct, the ratio would be:
- Ratio = $311 / $68 ≈ 4.57
- However, the table data is typically more precise, so the answer based on the table is preferred unless specified otherwise.
