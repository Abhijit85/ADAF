=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the interest expense in 2015 assuming that all the debt is interest bearing debt , ( in billions ) ?",
  "Calculation": "1. From the text context, the total debt at December 31, 2015, is $28.5 billion. 2. The weighted-average all-in financing cost of the total debt in 2015 is 3.0%. 3. Calculate the interest expense: Interest expense = Total debt × Weighted-average interest rate = $28.5 billion × 3.0% = $28.5 billion × 0.03 = $0.855 billion.",
  "Answer": "0.855 billion",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- First U.S. dollar note: $500 million at 1.250%
- Second U.S. dollar note: $750 million at 3.375%
- Interest for first note = $500 million × 1.250% = $500 × 0.0125 = $6.25 million
- Interest for second note = $750 million × 3.375% = $750 × 0.03375 = $25.3125 million
- Total interest expense = $6.25 million + $25.3125 million = $31.5625 million
- $31.5625 million = $0.0315625 billion
- Interest expense = Total debt × Weighted-average interest rate
- Interest expense = $28.5 billion × 3.0%
- Interest expense = $28.5 billion × 0.03
- Interest expense = $0.855 billion
