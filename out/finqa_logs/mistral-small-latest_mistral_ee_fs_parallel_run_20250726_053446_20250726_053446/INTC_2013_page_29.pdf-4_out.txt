✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "of the square feet in the us what was the percent of the owned facility of the us total",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the part (Owned facilities in the US) = 29.9 million sq ft\n2. Identify the base (Total facilities in the US) = 32.2 million sq ft\n3. Calculate the percentage: (29.9 / 32.2) × 100\n4. Perform the division: 29.9 ÷ 32.2 ≈ 0.9286\n5. Convert to percentage: 0.9286 × 100 ≈ 92.86%",
