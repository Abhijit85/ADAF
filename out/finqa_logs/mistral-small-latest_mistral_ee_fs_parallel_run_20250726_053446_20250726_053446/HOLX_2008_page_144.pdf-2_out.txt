=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what portion of the suros acquisition price is paid in cash?",
  "Calculation": "Total cash paid = $139000 (cash) + $2600 (fees) = $141600. Portion in cash = (141600 / 248100) * 100 ≈ 57.08%",
  "Answer": "57.08%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The initial aggregate purchase price for Suro's was **$248,100** (subject to adjustment).
- The purchase price consisted of:
- **4,600 shares of Hologic common stock** valued at **$106,500**.
- **Cash paid** of **$139,000**.
- **Acquisition-related fees and expenses** of approximately **$2,600**.
- The table does not explicitly break down the cash portion of the purchase price, but the text provides the necessary details.
- Cash paid for acquisition: **$139,000**.
- Acquisition-related fees and expenses: **$2,600**.
- **Total cash portion = $139,000 + $2,600 = $141,600**.
- **Cash portion ($141,600) ÷ Total purchase price ($248,100) × 100%**
- **= (141,600 / 248,100) × 100 ≈ 57.08%**
- None, as the text provides all necessary details for the calculation.
