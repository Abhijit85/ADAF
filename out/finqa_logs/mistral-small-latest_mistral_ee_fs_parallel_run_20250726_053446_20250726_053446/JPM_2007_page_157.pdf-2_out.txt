=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the difference in total additions between 2006 and 2007 in millions?",
  "Calculation": "Difference = Total additions in 2007 - Total additions in 2006 = 3133 million - 2139 million = 994 million",
  "Answer": "994 million",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Total additions in 2007: 3,133
- Total additions in 2006: 2,139
- Difference = 3,133 million (2007) - 2,139 million (2006)
- Difference = 994 million
