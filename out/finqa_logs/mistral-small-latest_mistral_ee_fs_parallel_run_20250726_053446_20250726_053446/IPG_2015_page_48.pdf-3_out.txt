=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the total difference , in millions , in 2015 between a 10% ( 10 % ) increase and 10% ( 10 % ) decrease in interest rates?",
  "Calculation": "Difference = (10% Decrease) - (10% Increase) = $34.7 million - $(33.7) million = $34.7 million + $33.7 million = $68.4 million",
  "Answer": "68.4 million",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 10% Increase in Interest Rates: $(33.7) million
- 10% Decrease in Interest Rates: $34.7 million
- Difference = (10% Decrease) - (10% Increase)
- Difference = $34.7 million - $(33.7) million
- Difference = $34.7 million + $33.7 million (since subtracting a negative is adding)
- Difference = $68.4 million
- Difference = (10% Decrease) - (10% Increase)
- Difference = $34.7 million - $(33.7) million
- Difference = $34.7 million + $33.7 million (since subtracting a negative is adding)
- Difference = $68.4 million
- The calculation is straightforward and follows basic arithmetic rules.
- The result is reasonable given the context of interest rate sensitivity in financial instruments.
- The units (millions) are correctly maintained throughout the calculation.
