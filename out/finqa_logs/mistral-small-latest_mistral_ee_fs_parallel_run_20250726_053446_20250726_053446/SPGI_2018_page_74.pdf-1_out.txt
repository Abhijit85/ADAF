=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the ratio of the pension trust assets for 2017 to 2018",
  "Calculation": "The table provides aggregated pension trust assets of $39 million for both 2017 and 2018. The ratio is calculated as 2017 value / 2018 value = $39 / $39 = 1.",
  "Answer": 1,
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2017: $39 million
- 2018: $39 million
- Ratio = 2017 value / 2018 value = $39 / $39 = 1
- Pension trust assets (aggregated): $39 million (2017 and 2018)
