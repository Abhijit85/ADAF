✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "in 2014 , what percentage of the total amortization amount was from intangibles?",
  "Calculation": "Unable to calculate due to missing total amortization amount for 2014. Intangible amortization is $36 million, but total amortization for 2014 is not provided in the table or text.",
  "Answer": "Unable to determine (missing total amortization data for 2014)",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The table provides amortization amounts for 2015–2019 but does not include 2014 data.
- Intangible amortization in 2014 = **$36 million** (from text).
- The text does not provide the total amortization expense for 2014. The table only provides data for 2015–2019, so we cannot derive the 2014 total from the table.
- Without the total amortization expense for 2014, we cannot calculate the percentage of intangible amortization.
