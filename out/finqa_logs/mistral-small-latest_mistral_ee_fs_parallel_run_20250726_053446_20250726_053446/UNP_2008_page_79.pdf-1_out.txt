✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percent of the value of the interest retained by upri from 2007 to 2008 was $ 431 million and $ 471 million , respectively .",
  "Calculation": "1. Difference = $471 million - $431 million = $40 million\n2. Percentage Increase = ($40 million / $431 million) × 100 ≈ 9.28%",
  "Answer": "9.28%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Base (2007 value): $431 million
- Part (2008 value): $471 million
- Difference = $471 million - $431 million = $40 million
- Percentage Increase = (Difference / Base) × 100
- Percentage Increase = ($40 million / $431 million) × 100 ≈ 9.28%
