=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the total value of net operating loss carryforwards?",
  "Calculation": "Federal Total: $2157503 + State Total: $2418012 = $4575515",
  "Answer": "$4575515",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Federal Total: $2,157,503
- State Total: $2,418,012
- Federal: $2,157,503
- State: $2,418,012
- None, as the table and text context provide sufficient information for this calculation.
