✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the average net revenue between 2016 and 2017 in millions",
  "Calculation": "1. 2016 net revenue = $1520.5 million\n2. 2017 net revenue = $1522.6 million\n3. Sum = $1520.5 + $1522.6 = $3043.1 million\n4. Average = $3043.1 / 2 = $1521.55 million",
  "Answer": "$1521.55 million",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The calculation is straightforward and mathematically correct.
- The result is reasonable given the net revenue values for 2016 and 2017.
- The answer is presented with appropriate precision (two decimal places).
