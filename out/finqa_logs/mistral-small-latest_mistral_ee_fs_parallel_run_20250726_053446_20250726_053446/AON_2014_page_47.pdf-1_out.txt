Answer Echoes:
- 2014: 11.4%
- 2013: 7.8%
- 2012: 7.4%
- Average = (11.4% + 7.8% + 7.4%) / 3
- Average = 26.6% / 3
- Average = 8.8667%
- Variation = Highest - Average
- Variation = 11.4% - 8.8667%
- Variation = 2.5333%
- Average = (11.4% + 7.8% + 7.4%) / 3
- Average = 26.6% / 3
- Average = 8.8667%
- Highest operating margin = 11.4% (from 2014).
- Variation = Highest - Average
- Variation = 11.4% - 8.8667%
- Variation = 2.5333%
- Variation = 2.53%
