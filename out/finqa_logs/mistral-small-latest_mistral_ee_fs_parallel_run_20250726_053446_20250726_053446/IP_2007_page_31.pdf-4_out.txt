=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "in 2005 what was industrial packaging the profit margin",
  "Calculation": "Profit Margin = (Operating Profit / Sales) × 100 = (37 / 4600) × 100 = 0.804%",
  "Answer": "0.804%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Operating Profit (2005) = $219 million
- Sales (2005) = $4,625 million
- The exact operating profit for industrial packaging in 2005 is not directly provided in the text or table. The $37 million figure is the overall operating earnings for the segment, which may include other components beyond industrial packaging. If more precise data is available, the calculation should be adjusted accordingly.
