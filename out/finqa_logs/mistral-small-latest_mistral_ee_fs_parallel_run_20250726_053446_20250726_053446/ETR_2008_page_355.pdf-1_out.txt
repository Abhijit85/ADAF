=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the growth rate in net revenue in 2008 compare to 2007?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the net revenue for 2007 and 2008: 2007 net revenue = $231.0 million, 2008 net revenue = $252.7 million. 2. Calculate the difference in net revenue: 252.7 - 231.0 = 21.7 million. 3. Calculate the growth rate: (21.7 / 231.0) × 100 = 9.39%.",
  "Answer": "9.39%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2007 net revenue = $231.0 million
- 2008 net revenue = $252.7 million
- Difference = 252.7 - 231.0 = 21.7 million
- Growth rate = (Difference / 2007 net revenue) × 100
- Growth rate = (21.7 / 231.0) × 100 ≈ 9.39%
- The growth rate is reasonable given the context of increased electricity usage (4% increase in billed retail electricity usage) and other revenue drivers mentioned in the text (e.g., higher fuel rates, base rate recovery credit, and storm reserve rider).
- The calculation aligns with standard financial analysis practices for year-over-year growth rate comparisons.
