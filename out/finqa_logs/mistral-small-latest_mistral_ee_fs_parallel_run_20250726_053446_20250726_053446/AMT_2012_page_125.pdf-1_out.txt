=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "for the mtn group acquisition , what was the cost per tower ? .",
  "Calculation": "Total Purchase Price: $173200000\nNumber of Communications Sites: 962\nCost per tower = Total Purchase Price / Number of Communications Sites = 173200000 / 962 ≈ 180041.58\nRounded to nearest dollar: $180042",
  "Answer": "$180042",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The table does not provide a direct breakdown of the purchase price allocation for towers or the number of towers acquired.
- Since the purchase price includes both tangible and intangible assets, we assume the entire purchase price is allocated to the acquisition of the 962 communications sites (unless specified otherwise).
- **Calculation**:
- **Rounding**: $180,042 per tower (to the nearest dollar).
- If the purchase price includes non-tower assets (e.g., intangibles, liabilities), the actual cost per tower would be lower.
- The table does not provide a breakdown of how much of the $173.2 million was allocated to tangible assets (towers) vs. intangibles. If such a breakdown were available, the calculation would adjust accordingly.
- The entire purchase price is allocated to the 962 communications sites (no separate allocation for intangibles or other assets).
- The term "communications sites" refers to towers (or includes towers as the primary asset). If "communications sites" include other infrastructure, the cost per tower would differ.
