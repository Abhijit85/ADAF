=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the total five year change in the s&p 500 index?",
  "Calculation": "Starting value (2007): 100\nEnding value (2012): 109\nChange = Ending value - Starting value = 109 - 100 = 9",
  "Answer": 9,
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Starting value (2007): 100
- Ending value (2012): 109
- Change = Ending value - Starting value
- Change = 109 - 100 = 9
