=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what amount of long-term debt is due in the next 24 months for entergy corporation as of december 31 , 2013 , in millions?",
  "Calculation": "The table does not provide specific amounts for 2014 and 2015 (the next 24 months from December 31, 2013). The text mentions that the fair value excludes certain obligations but includes debt due within one year. Without the exact numbers from the table, the calculation cannot be performed.",
  "Answer": "Cannot be determined from the provided data.",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Lease obligations ($149 million at Entergy Louisiana, $97 million at System Energy).
- Long-term DOE obligations ($181 million at Entergy Arkansas).
- Note payable to NYPA ($95 million at Entergy).
- The table shows debt maturities for the years **2014 to 2018**, but does not explicitly state the amounts for **2013 or 2014** (the next 24 months from December 31, 2013).
- Since the table does not provide the required data, we must rely on the text for additional context.
- The text mentions that the fair value excludes certain obligations but includes debt due within one year.
- The table likely contains the annual long-term debt maturities for 2014 and 2015 (the next two years from December 31, 2013).
- However, since the table is not fully provided, we cannot extract the exact numbers.
- **2014**: $500 million
- **2015**: $600 million
