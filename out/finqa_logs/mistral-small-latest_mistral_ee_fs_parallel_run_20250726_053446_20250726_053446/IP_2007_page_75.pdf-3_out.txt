✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "at december 31 , 2007 , what was the percent of the total future minimum commitments under existing non-cancelable operat- ing leases for purchase obligations",
  "Calculation": "($136 / $2089) × 100 = 6.51%",
  "Answer": "6.51%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Lease obligations at December 31, 2007 (for 2008): $136 million
- Purchase obligations at December 31, 2007 (for 2008): $1,953 million
- Total future minimum commitments at December 31, 2007 (for 2008): $2,089 million
- The question asks for the percentage of the total future minimum commitments that are lease obligations.
- Formula: (Lease obligations / Total future minimum commitments) × 100
- Calculation: ($136 / $2,089) × 100
- $136 / $2,089 ≈ 0.0651
- 0.0651 × 100 ≈ 6.51%
