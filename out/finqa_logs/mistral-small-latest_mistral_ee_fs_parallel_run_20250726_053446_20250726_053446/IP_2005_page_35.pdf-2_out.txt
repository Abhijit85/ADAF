=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the change in total debt to be repaid in the contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase obligations at december 31 , 2005 between 2008 and 2007?",
  "Calculation": "Change = 2008 Total - 2007 Total = $707 million - $1107 million = -$400 million",
  "Answer": "-$400 million (a decrease of $400 million)",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2007 Total: $1,107 million
- 2008 Total: $707 million
- Change = 2008 Total - 2007 Total
- Change = $707 million - $1,107 million
- Change = -$400 million
- Change = 2008 Total - 2007 Total
- Change = $707 million - $1,107 million
- Change = -$400 million
