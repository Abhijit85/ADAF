=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "for the quarter ended september 302010 what was the percentage change in the share price from the highest to the lowest",
  "Calculation": "1. High share price: $52.11\n2. Low share price: $43.70\n3. Difference = $52.11 - $43.70 = $8.41\n4. Percentage Change = ($8.41 / $52.11) × 100 ≈ 16.14%",
  "Answer": "16.14%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- High: $52.11
- Low: $43.70
- Difference = High - Low = $52.11 - $43.70 = $8.41
- Percentage Change = (Difference / High) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($8.41 / $52.11) × 100 ≈ 16.14%
- Difference = High - Low = $52.11 - $43.70 = $8.41
- Percentage Change = (Difference / High) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($8.41 / $52.11) × 100 ≈ 16.14%
