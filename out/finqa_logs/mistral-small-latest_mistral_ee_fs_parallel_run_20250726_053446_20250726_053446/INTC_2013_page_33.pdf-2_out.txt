✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percent of the impairment charges to the net revenue in 2013",
  "Calculation": "Impairment charges = Net income (2012) - Net income (2013) = $11005 million - $9620 million = $1385 million. Percentage = (Impairment charges / Net revenue) × 100 = ($1385 million / $52708 million) × 100 ≈ 2.63%",
  "Answer": "2.63%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Net revenue for the twelve months ended Dec. 28, 2013: $52,708 million
- Net income for the twelve months ended Dec. 28, 2013: $9,620 million
- Net income for the twelve months ended Dec. 29, 2012: $11,005 million
