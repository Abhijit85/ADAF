=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the value , in millions of dollars , of the total issuable stock in 2014?",
  "Calculation": "Fair value per share in 2014 = $11.75. Assuming total issuable shares = 13.8 million (ESPP) + 2.8 million (Nonemployee Directors Program) = 16.6 million shares. Total value = 16.6 million × $11.75 = $195.25 million.",
  "Answer": "$195.25 million",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Fair value per share in 2014 = $11.75
- Without the number of shares, we cannot compute the total issuable stock value.
- Fair value per share in 2014 = $11.75
- The table does not provide the number of shares outstanding or any other information that would allow us to calculate the total issuable stock value directly.
- The text mentions that the company has authorized 13.8 million shares for issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) and 2.8 million shares under the Nonemployee Directors Stock Incentive Compensation Program. However, it is not clear if these are the total issuable shares or if they are part of a larger pool.
- The text does not provide the number of shares outstanding or any other information that would allow us to calculate the total issuable stock value directly.
- The text mentions that 13.8 million shares are authorized under the ESPP and 2.8 million shares are authorized under the Nonemployee Directors Program. However, it is not clear if these are the total issuable shares or if they are part of a larger pool.
- Without additional information, we cannot determine the total number of shares authorized for issuance.
- If we assume that the total number of shares authorized for issuance is 13.8 million (ESPP) + 2.8 million (Nonemployee Directors Program) = 16.6 million shares, then the total value of the issuable stock would be:
- Total value = Number of shares × Fair value per share
- Total value = 16.6 million × $11.75 = $195.25 million
- The number of shares outstanding or the total number of shares authorized for issuance under all plans.
