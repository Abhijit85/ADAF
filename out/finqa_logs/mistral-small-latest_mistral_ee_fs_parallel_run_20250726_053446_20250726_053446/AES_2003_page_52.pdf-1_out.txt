=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "for the three months ended march 2003 what were the total sales proceeds for subsidiaries assets in millions?",
  "Calculation": "Sum of sales proceeds for January 2003 ($495M + $59M) = $554M; Sum of sales proceeds for March 2003 ($30M + $29M) = $59M; Total = $554M + $59M = $613M",
  "Answer": "613 million",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The text context mentions that the company continued to sell subsidiaries in 2003 to improve liquidity and reduce financial leverage. However, the table data already provides the specific sales proceeds for the relevant period, so no additional context is needed for this calculation.
