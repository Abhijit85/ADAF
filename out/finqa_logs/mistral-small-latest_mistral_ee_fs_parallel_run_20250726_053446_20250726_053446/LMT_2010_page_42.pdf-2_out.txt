=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the percentage increase in the net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 compare to 2009?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify values: 2010 = $3547 million, 2009 = $3173 million. 2. Calculate difference: $3547 - $3173 = $374 million. 3. Calculate percentage increase: ($374 / $3173) × 100 ≈ 11.79%.",
  "Answer": "11.79%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2010: $3,547 million
- 2009: $3,173 million
- Difference = $3,547 - $3,173 = $374 million
- Percentage Increase = (Difference / 2009 Value) × 100
- Percentage Increase = ($374 / $3,173) × 100 ≈ 11.79%
