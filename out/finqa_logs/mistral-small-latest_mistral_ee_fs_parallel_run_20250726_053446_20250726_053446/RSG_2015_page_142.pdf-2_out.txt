✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the percentage growth of the aggregate fair values of our outstanding fuel hedge for 2014 to 2015",
  "Calculation": "Percentage Growth = (($37.8 million - $34.4 million) / $34.4 million) × 100 = (3.4 / 34.4) × 100 ≈ 9.88%",
  "Answer": "9.88%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2014: $34.4 million
- 2015: $37.8 million
- Difference = $37.8 million - $34.4 million = $3.4 million
- Percentage Growth = (Difference / 2014 Value) × 100
- Percentage Growth = ($3.4 million / $34.4 million) × 100 ≈ 9.88%
