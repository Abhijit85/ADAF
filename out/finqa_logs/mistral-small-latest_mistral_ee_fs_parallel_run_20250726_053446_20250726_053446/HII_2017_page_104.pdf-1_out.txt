=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the percentage change in the unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the senior notes from 2016 to 2017?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the unamortized debt issuance costs for 2016 and 2017 from the text context: 2016: $19 million, 2017: $15 million. 2. Calculate the difference: $15 million - $19 million = -$4 million. 3. Calculate the percentage change using the 2016 value as the base: (-$4 million / $19 million) × 100 ≈ -21.05%.",
  "Answer": "-21.05%",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2016: $(27) million
- 2017: $(26) million
- Difference = 2017 cost - 2016 cost = -26 - (-27) = 1 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2016 cost) × 100 = (1 / -27) × 100 ≈ -3.70%
- 2016: $19 million
- 2017: $15 million
- Difference = 2017 cost - 2016 cost = $15 million - $19 million = -$4 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2016 cost) × 100 = (-$4 million / $19 million) × 100 ≈ -21.05%
