=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was purchases of reserves in place in 2016?",
  "Calculation": "The value is directly provided in the table under 'Purchases of reserves in place' for 2016 as 15 mmboe. No further calculations are needed.",
  "Answer": "15 mmboe",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- "Purchases of reserves in place" = 15
- No further calculations are needed as the value is directly provided in the table.
---
- None, as the table data directly provides the answer. The text context aligns with the table but does not contradict it.
