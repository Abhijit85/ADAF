=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage change in the company recognized tax-related interest and penalties in 2011.",
  "Calculation": "The percentage change cannot be calculated with the provided data. The text mentions a $3 million decrease in 2011, but the starting value (prior year or 2011 beginning balance) is not provided. Without this information, the percentage change cannot be determined.",
  "Answer": "Insufficient data to calculate the percentage change.",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The recognized tax-related interest and penalties for a prior year (e.g., 2010) to calculate the percentage change.
- Alternatively, the recognized tax-related interest and penalties for 2011 before the $3 million decrease to calculate the percentage change.
