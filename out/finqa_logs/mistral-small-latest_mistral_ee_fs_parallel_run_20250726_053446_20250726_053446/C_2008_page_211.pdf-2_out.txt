✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "in 2008 what was the carrying amount reported on the consolidated balance sheet to aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of fair value of the trading assets",
  "Calculation": "Ratio = Carrying amount / Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of fair value = $16254 million / $6501 million ≈ 2.499 (rounded to 2 decimal places)",
  "Answer": "2.50",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Carrying amount reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for Trading Assets in 2008: $16,254 million
- Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of fair value for Trading Assets in 2008: $6,501 million
- Ratio = Carrying amount / Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of fair value
- Ratio = $16,254 / $6,501
- Ratio ≈ 2.499 (rounded to 3 decimal places)
- Carrying amount = $16,254 million
- Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of fair value = $6,501 million
- Ratio = Carrying amount / Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of fair value
- Ratio = $16,254 / $6,501
- Ratio ≈ 2.499 (rounded to 3 decimal places)
- The ratio of 2.50 indicates that the carrying amount is approximately 2.5 times the aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of fair value for trading assets in 2008. This is a reasonable result given the context of the financial data provided.
