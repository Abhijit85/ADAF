=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "for the ipl cumulative preferred stock , what was the dividend rate at december 31 , 2016 and 2015?",
  "Calculation": "Dividend Rate = (Annual Dividend Requirement / Total Preferred Stock Outstanding) × 100% = ($3 million / $60 million) × 100% = 5%",
  "Answer": "5%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The dividend rate can be calculated as the annual dividend requirement divided by the total preferred stock outstanding.
- Formula: Dividend Rate = (Annual Dividend Requirement / Total Preferred Stock Outstanding) × 100%
- For 2016 and 2015:
- Annual Dividend Requirement = $3 million
- Total Preferred Stock Outstanding = $60 million
- Dividend Rate = ($3 million / $60 million) × 100% = 5%
