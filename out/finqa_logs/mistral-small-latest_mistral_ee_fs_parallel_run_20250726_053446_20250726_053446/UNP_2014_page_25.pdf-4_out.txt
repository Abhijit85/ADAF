{
  "Question": "what was the percentage change in fuel surcharge program freight revenue from 2013 to 2014?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the relevant values for fuel surcharge revenues in 2013 and 2014:\n   - 2014 Fuel Surcharge Revenue = $2.8 billion\n   - 2013 Fuel Surcharge Revenue = $2.6 billion\n2. Calculate the difference between 2014 and 2013:\n   - Difference = $2.8 billion - $2.6 billion = $0.2 billion\n3.

}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2014 Freight Revenues = $22,560 million
- 2013 Freight Revenues = $20,684 million
- Difference = $22,560 - $20,684 = $1,876 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2013 Freight Revenues) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($1,876 / $20,684) × 100 ≈ 9.07%
- 2014 Fuel Surcharge Revenue = $2.8 billion
- 2013 Fuel Surcharge Revenue = $2.6 billion
- Difference = $2.8 billion - $2.6 billion = $0.2 billion
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2013 Fuel Surcharge Revenue) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($0.2 billion / $2.6 billion) × 100 ≈ 7.69%
