✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what are the notes due 2021 as a percentage of total long-term borrowings?",
  "Calculation": "Notes due 2021: $750 million. Total long-term borrowings: $4938 million. Percentage = (750 / 4938) × 100 = 15.19%",
  "Answer": "15.19%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The text context does not explicitly mention the notes due in 2021, so the table data is relied upon for this specific figure. If the notes due in 2021 are not the $750 million referenced in the table, additional context or clarification would be needed.
