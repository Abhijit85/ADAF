{
  "Question": "in 2016 based on the increase in the net sales what was the ratio of the increasing factor to the offsetting factors that reduced sales",
  "Calculation": "Increase in net sales = $17769 - $15570 = $2199 million. Offsetting factor (reduction in operating profit) = $65 million. Ratio = $2199 / $65 = 33.83",
  "Answer": 33.83,
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Net sales in 2016: $17,769
- Net sales in 2015: $15,570
- Increase in net sales: $17,769 - $15,570 = $2,199
- Operating margin in 2016: 10.6%
- Operating margin in 2015: 10.8%
- Decrease in operating margin: 10.8% - 10.6% = 0.2%
- Ratio = Increase in net sales / Decrease in operating margin
- Ratio = $2,199 / 0.2% = $2,199 / 0.002 = 1,099,500
- **Net Sales 2016**: $17,769 million
- **Net Sales 2015**: $15,570 million
- **Operating Profit 2016**: $1,883 million (10.6% of net sales)
- **Operating Profit 2015**: $1,677 million (10.8% of net sales)
- Net Sales 2016: $17,769 million
- Net Sales 2015: $15,570 million
- Increase in Net Sales = $17,769 - $15,570 = $2,199 million.
- Operating Profit 2016: $1,883 million
- Operating Profit 2015: $1,677 million
- Decrease in Operating Profit = $1,883 - $1,677 = $206 million (but this is an increase, not a decrease).
- Alternatively, the text mentions a $65 million reduction in operating profit for the C-130 program, which is part of the offsetting factors.
- The ratio of the increasing factor (increase in net sales) to the offsetting factor (reduction in operating profit) is:
- Ratio = Increase in Net Sales / Reduction in Operating Profit
- Ratio = $2,199 million / $65 million = 33.83.
- The exact value of the offsetting factors (reduction in operating profit) should be clearly defined. The text mentions a $65 million reduction for the C-130 program, but it is unclear if this is the total offsetting factor or part of it. If the total offsetting factor is $65 million, the ratio is 33.83. If the offsetting factor is larger, the ratio would be smaller. Clarification is needed.
