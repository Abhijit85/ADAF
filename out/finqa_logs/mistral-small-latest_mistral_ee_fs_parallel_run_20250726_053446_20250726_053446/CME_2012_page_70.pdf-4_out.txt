✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "by what percentage can cme increase their current line of credit?",
  "Calculation": "Current Line of Credit: $5000 million\nMaximum Possible Line of Credit: $7000 million\nIncrease: $7000 million - $5000 million = $2000 million\nPercentage Increase: ($2000 / $5000) × 100 = 40%",
  "Answer": "40%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Designated corporate contributions: $100.0 million
- Guaranty fund contributions: $2,899.5 million
- Assessment powers: $7,973.6 million
- **Total Available Assets**: $100.0 + $2,899.5 + $7,973.6 = $10,973.1 million
- Minimum Total Assets Available for Default: $10,973.1 million
- The current line of credit is not explicitly stated in the table. However, the "Minimum Total Assets Available for Default" likely represents the total assets required to cover potential defaults, which may include the line of credit. For the purpose of this calculation, we will assume that the "Assessment powers" ($7,973.6 million) represent the current line of credit, as it is the largest component and likely the most flexible asset.
- **Current Line of Credit (Assessment Powers)**: $7,973.6 million
- **Total Available Assets**: $10,973.1 million
- **Remaining Assets**: $10,973.1 - $7,973.6 = $2,999.5 million
- **Percentage Increase**: (Remaining Assets / Current Line of Credit) × 100
- ($2,999.5 / $7,973.6) × 100 ≈ 37.6%
