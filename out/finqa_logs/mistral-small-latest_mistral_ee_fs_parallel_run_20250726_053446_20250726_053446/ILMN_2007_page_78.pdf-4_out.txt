✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "based on the investment in solexa on november 12 , 2006 what was the price per share in the transaction in dollars",
  "Calculation": "Price per share = Total Investment / Number of Shares = $50000000 / 5154639 ≈ $9.70",
  "Answer": "$9.70",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The table does not provide the price per share at the time of investment (November 12, 2006), but the text explicitly states the **market value per share ($13.15) as of December 31, 2006**.
- The **market value per share ($13.15) as of December 31, 2006**, is provided, but this is **not the transaction price** (which was $9.70). The market value reflects post-investment valuation, not the purchase price.
