}
```

Answer Echoes:
- November: 4,468 shares at $3.24 per share
- December: 12,850 shares at $3.98 per share
- Total shares (Nov + Dec) = 4,468 + 12,850 = 17,318 shares
- Total cost (Nov) = 4,468 × $3.24 = $14,483.12
- Total cost (Dec) = 12,850 × $3.98 = $51,073.00
- Combined total cost = $14,483.12 + $51,073.00 = $65,556.12
- Average price = Total cost / Total shares
- Average price = $65,556.12 / 17,318 ≈ $3.785
- 4,468 (Nov) + 12,850 (Dec) = 17,318 shares
- November: 4,468 × $3.24 = $14,483.12
- December: 12,850 × $3.98 = $51,073.00
- Combined total cost: $14,483.12 + $51,073.00 = $65,556.12
- $65,556.12 ÷ 17,318 ≈ $3.785
- Rounded to two decimal places: $3.79
