  "Question": "what is the growth rate in net revenue in 2016 for entergy texas , inc.?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the net revenues for 2015 and 2016:\n   - 2015 net revenue = $637.2 million\n   - 2016 net revenue = $644.2 million\n2.

  "Answer": "1.10%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2015 net revenue = $637.2 million
- 2016 net revenue = $644.2 million
- Difference = 2016 net revenue - 2015 net revenue = $644.2 million - $637.2 million = $7.0 million
- Growth rate = (Difference / 2015 net revenue) × 100
- Growth rate = ($7.0 million / $637.2 million) × 100 ≈ 1.10%
