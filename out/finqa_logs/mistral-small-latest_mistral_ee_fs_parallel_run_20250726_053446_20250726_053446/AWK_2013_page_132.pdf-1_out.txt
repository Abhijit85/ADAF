✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "based on the information provided what is the ratio of the post retirement benefit obligation to the service and interest one-point percentage increase",
  "Calculation": "Ratio = $72238 / $7367 ≈ 9.805 (rounded to 9.81)",
  "Answer": 9.81,
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Effect on other postretirement benefit obligation (One-Percentage-Point Increase) = $72,238
- Effect on total of service and interest cost components (One-Percentage-Point Increase) = $7,367
- Ratio = $72,238 / $7,367 ≈ 9.805
- Postretirement benefit obligation (One-Percentage-Point Increase) = $72,238
- Service and interest cost components (One-Percentage-Point Increase) = $7,367
- Ratio = $72,238 / $7,367 ≈ 9.805
- Ratio ≈ 9.81
