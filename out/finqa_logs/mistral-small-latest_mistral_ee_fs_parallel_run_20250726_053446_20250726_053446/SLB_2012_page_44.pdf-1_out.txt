=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "as of december 312012 what was the outstanding amount of share repurchase authorized in billions?",
  "Calculation": "Total authorized share repurchase amount = $8 billion (from text). Amount repurchased by December 31, 2012 = $7.12 billion (from text). Outstanding amount = $8 billion - $7.12 billion = $0.88 billion.",
  "Answer": "$0.88 billion",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The table shows the total cost of shares purchased in 2010, 2011, and 2012, but does not provide the outstanding authorized amount.
- Outstanding = Total Authorized - Amount Repurchased
- Outstanding = $8 billion - $7.12 billion = $0.88 billion.
