=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the average price of the increased electricity usage per gwh?",
  "Calculation": "Assuming the $22 million increase in Power Management Rider Revenue is directly tied to the 1046 GWh increase in usage, the calculation is: $22000000 / 1046 GWh ≈ $21020 per GWh. Note: This is speculative as the text does not explicitly link the revenue increase to the usage increase.",
  "Answer": "$21020 per GWh (speculative)",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- **Power Management Rider Revenue**: Increased by **$22 million** due to higher rates.
- **Grand Gulf Rider Revenue**: Increased due to higher rates and increased usage.
- **Fuel Cost Recovery Revenues**: Decreased by **$23.5 million** due to lower fuel rates.
- Decreased due to deferred fuel expense (prior over-collections).
- Offset by an increase in the average market price of purchased power and increased net area demand.
- The **total revenue or cost associated with the increased 1,046 GWh** is not explicitly provided in the text or table.
- The breakdown of how much of the revenue changes ($22M increase, $23.5M decrease) is directly tied to the increased electricity usage is unclear.
- If the **$22M increase in Power Management Rider Revenue** is directly tied to the increased usage, we could use this.
- Alternatively, if the **$23.5M decrease in Fuel Cost Recovery** is offset by higher purchased power costs, we might need to adjust.
- **Formula**:
- **Example (if $22M is directly tied to 1,046 GWh)**:
- However, this is speculative without clear linkage in the text.
- The **specific revenue or cost associated with the 1,046 GWh increase** must be provided to calculate the average price per GWh.
- Without this information, the calculation cannot be completed accurately.
