=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "how much of the firm-sponsored qspes that hold asf framework loans are serviced by the firm?",
  "Calculation": "From the text context:\n1. Total ASF framework loans held by firm-sponsored QSPEs = $20.0 billion\n2. Portion serviced by the firm = $9.7 billion\n3. Percentage serviced by the firm = ($9.7 billion / $20.0 billion) × 100 = 48.5%",
  "Answer": "48.5%",

}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Total QSPEs holding ASF framework loans = $20,048 million
- Portion serviced by the firm (Retained interest) = $412 million
