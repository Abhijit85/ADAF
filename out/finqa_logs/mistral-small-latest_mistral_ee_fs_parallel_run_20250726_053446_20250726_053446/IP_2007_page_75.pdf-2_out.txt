=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what percentage of december 31 , 2007 , total future minimum commitments under existing non-cancelable operating leases and purchase obligations were due to lease obligations for the year of 2008?",
  "Calculation": "1. Total future minimum commitments = $2089 (2008) + $410 (2009) + $362 (2010) + $319 (2011) + $279 (2012) + $1572 (Thereafter) = $4031 million. 2. Lease obligations for 2008 = $136 million. 3. Percentage = ($136 / $4031) × 100 ≈ 3.37%.",

}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Total commitments = $2,089 (2008) + $410 (2009) + $362 (2010) + $319 (2011) + $279 (2012) + $1,572 (Thereafter)
- Total commitments = $2,089 + $410 + $362 + $319 + $279 + $1,572 = $4,031 million
- Lease obligations for 2008 = $136 million
- Percentage = (Lease obligations for 2008 / Total commitments) × 100
- Percentage = ($136 / $4,031) × 100 ≈ 3.37%
- Percentage = (Lease obligations for 2008 / Total commitments) × 100
- Percentage = ($136 / $4,031) × 100 ≈ 3.37%
