=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percent of the change in the consulting segment revenue from 2008 2009",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the segment revenue for 2008 and 2009 from the table: 2009: $1267 million, 2008: $1356 million. 2. Calculate the difference in revenue: $1267 - $1356 = -$89 million. 3. Calculate the percentage change: (-$89 / $1356) × 100 ≈ -6.57%.",
  "Answer": "-6.57%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2009: $1,267
- 2008: $1,356
- Difference = 2009 revenue - 2008 revenue = $1,267 - $1,356 = -$89
- Percentage change = (Difference / 2008 revenue) × 100
- Percentage change = (-$89 / $1,356) × 100 ≈ -6.57%
- Difference = 2009 revenue - 2008 revenue = $1,267 - $1,356 = -$89 million
- Percentage change = (Difference / 2008 revenue) × 100
- Percentage change = (-$89 / $1,356) × 100 ≈ -6.57%
