✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the ratio of the debts to the assets in the purchase transaction",
  "Calculation": "Ratio = Debt assumed / Total assets acquired = 148527000 / 713202000 ≈ 0.2080",
  "Answer": "0.2080 (or 20.80%)",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Debt assumed = $148,527
- Total assets acquired = $867,558
- Ratio = Debt assumed / Total assets acquired
- Ratio = 148,527 / 867,558 ≈ 0.1713
- Debt assumed = $148,527,000
- Total assets acquired (purchase price net of assumed liabilities) = $713,202,000
- Ratio = Debt assumed / Total assets acquired
- Ratio = 148,527,000 / 713,202,000 ≈ 0.2080
- None, as all necessary data was provided in the table and text context.
