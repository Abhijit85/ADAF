=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage change in net income ( loss ) on a pro forma basis between 2006 and 2007?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify net income (loss) for 2006 and 2007: 2006: $(38957), 2007: $17388. 2. Calculate difference: $17388 - (-$38957) = $56345. 3. Compute percentage change using 2006 as base: ($56345 / $38957) × 100 ≈ 144.65%.",
  "Answer": "144.65%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2007: $17,388
- 2006: $(38,957) (negative value)
- Difference = $17,388 - (-$38,957) = $17,388 + $38,957 = $56,345
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2006 Net Income) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($56,345 / $38,957) × 100 ≈ 144.65%
- Difference = $17,388 - (-$38,957) = $17,388 + $38,957 = $56,345 (thousands)
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2006 Net Income) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($56,345 / $38,957) × 100 ≈ 144.65%
