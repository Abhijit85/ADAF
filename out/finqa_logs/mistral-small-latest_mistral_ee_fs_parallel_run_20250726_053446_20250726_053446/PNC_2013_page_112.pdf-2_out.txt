=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "in these equity investment balances , what is the percent of unfunded commitments at december 31 , 2012?",
  "Calculation": "Percentage = (Unfunded Commitments / Total Equity Investments) * 100 = (685 / 3000) * 100 = 22.83%",
  "Answer": "22.83%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- $3.0 billion = $3,000 million.
- $685 million.
---
- The table does not explicitly list "unfunded commitments," so the text context was necessary to derive the answer.
- The total equity investments ($3.0 billion) include both funded and unfunded commitments, as clarified in the text.
