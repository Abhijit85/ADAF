=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage change in operating income from 2016 to 2017?",
  "Calculation": "1. 2016 Operating Income = $10815 million\n2. 2017 Operating Income = $11503 million\n3. Difference = $11503 million - $10815 million = $688 million\n4. Percentage Change = ($688 million / $10815 million) × 100 ≈ 6.37%",
  "Answer": "6.37%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2016 Operating Income = $10,815 million
- 2017 Operating Income = $11,503 million
- Difference = 2017 Operating Income - 2016 Operating Income
- Difference = $11,503 million - $10,815 million = $688 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2016 Operating Income) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($688 million / $10,815 million) × 100 ≈ 6.37%
- Difference = 2017 Operating Income - 2016 Operating Income
- Difference = $11,503 million - $10,815 million = $688 million (matches the text context).
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2016 Operating Income) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($688 million / $10,815 million) × 100 ≈ 6.37%.
