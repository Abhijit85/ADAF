=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "as of december 31 , 2015 , what was the maximum premium on the dp&l preferred stock?",
  "Calculation": "Premium = Redemption Value - Book Value = $23 million - $18 million = $5 million",
  "Answer": "$5 million",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- **Outstanding Amount:** $18 million (as of December 31, 2015).
- **Redemption Price Range:** $101 to $103 per share (plus cumulative dividends).
- **Temporary Equity Classification:** Due to preferred stockholders' ability to elect board members if dividends are in arrears.
- The preferred stock was redeemable at DPL’s option but became probable for redemption in September 2016.
- In October 2016, DPL redeemed all preferred shares at a redemption value of $23 million (after a $5 million adjustment to retained earnings).
- The **maximum premium** is the difference between the **redemption value** and the **book value** of the preferred stock.
- The **book value** of the preferred stock as of December 31, 2015, is **$18 million** (from the table).
- The **redemption value** in October 2016 was **$23 million** (after a $5 million adjustment).
- The $5 million premium aligns with the adjustment to retained earnings in September 2016, confirming the calculation.
- The redemption in October 2016 at $23 million supports the fair value adjustment.
