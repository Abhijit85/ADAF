=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what portion of total long-term borrowings is due in the next 24 months?",
  "Calculation": "1. Sum of notes due in next 24 months: $750 (2015) + $700 (2017) + $1000 (2019) + $750 (2021) + $750 (2022) + $1000 (2024) = $4950 million. 2. Total long-term borrowings: $4950 million. 3. Portion due in next 24 months: ($4950 / $4950) × 100% = 100%.",
  "Answer": "100%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 1.375% Notes due 2015: $750
- 6.25% Notes due 2017: $700
- 5.00% Notes due 2019: $1,000
- 4.25% Notes due 2021: $750
- 3.375% Notes due 2022: $750
- 3.50% Notes due 2024: $1,000
- The text confirms that the **2024 notes** ($1.0 billion) were issued in March 2014 and are included in the long-term borrowings.
- The **2015 notes** ($750 million) and **2022 notes** ($750 million) were issued in May 2012 and are also part of the long-term borrowings.
- The **2021 notes** ($750 million) were issued in May 2011, but the **floating-rate notes** were repaid in May 2013, so only the **4.25% notes** remain.
- The **2019 notes** ($1,000 million) and **2017 notes** ($700 million) are not explicitly mentioned in the text, but the table includes them.
- $750 (2015) + $700 (2017) + $1,000 (2019) + $750 (2021) + $750 (2022) + $1,000 (2024) = **$4,950 million**.
- The table states the total is **$4,950 million**.
- ($4,950 / $4,950) × 100% = **100%**.
- The **2019 notes ($1,000 million)** and **2017 notes ($700 million)** are not explicitly mentioned in the text, but the table includes them. If these are not part of the long-term borrowings, the calculation would need adjustment. However, since the table and text align in total, we proceed with the given data.
- The sum of the notes due in the next 24 months matches the total long-term borrowings, confirming the calculation is correct.
