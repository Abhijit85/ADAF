=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "how much money can the company deduct on the income tax in the future after this acquisition?",
  "Calculation": "1. Goodwill is non-deductible (text context). 2. Deferred tax liability of $(9788) indicates future tax obligation, not deduction (table). 3. No deductible intangible asset values provided in table. Therefore, future tax deduction = $0.",
  "Answer": "$0",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- **Deferred income tax assets (liabilities)**: $(9,788)
- The negative sign indicates that this is a **deferred tax liability**, meaning the company will owe taxes in the future rather than being able to deduct them. If this were a positive value, it would represent a deferred tax asset (a future tax deduction).
- Deferred income tax assets (liabilities) = $(9,788)
- Future tax deduction = $0 (since it's a liability, not an asset)
- Values for the amortizable intangible assets (customer-related, technology, trade name) to determine their tax-deductible amounts over their respective amortization periods.
