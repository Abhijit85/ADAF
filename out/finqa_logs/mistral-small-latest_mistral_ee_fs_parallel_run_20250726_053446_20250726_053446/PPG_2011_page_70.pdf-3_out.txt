✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was royalty income as a percentage of total other income in 2009?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the base (total other income in 2009): $150 million\n2. Identify the part (royalty income in 2009): $45 million\n3. Calculate the percentage: (45 / 150) × 100 = 30%",
  "Answer": "30%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The exact breakdown of "other earnings" into royalty income and other components is not explicitly provided in the given text. The assumption that royalty income is $45 million in 2009 is inferred from the table's calculation example, but the actual value should be confirmed from the full financial statements or notes. If the royalty income is different, the percentage would change accordingly.
