=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what portion of the equity compensation plan approved by security holders is to be issued upon the exercise of options warrants and rights?",
  "Calculation": "Total equity compensation plan = 448859 (to be issued) + 4087587 (remaining) = 4536446. Portion to be issued = (448859 / 4536446) × 100 = 9.89%",
