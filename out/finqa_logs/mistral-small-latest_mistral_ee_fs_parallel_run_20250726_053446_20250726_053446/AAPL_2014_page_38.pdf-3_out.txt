=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the change in amount of long term debt between 2014 and 2012?",
  "Calculation": "Long-term debt in 2014: $28987 million - Long-term debt in 2012: $0 million = $28987 million",
  "Answer": "$28987 million",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Change = Long-term debt in 2014 - Long-term debt in 2012
- Change = $28,987 million - $0 million
- Change = $28,987 million
