=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percent of the decline in net income ( loss ) attributable to common shareholders from 2007 to 2008",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify net income (loss) for 2007 and 2008: 2007: $211942, 2008: $50408. 2. Calculate decline: $211942 - $50408 = $161534. 3. Calculate percentage decline: ($161534 / $211942) × 100 ≈ 76.24%.",
  "Answer": "76.24%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2007: $211,942
- 2008: $50,408
- Decline = 2007 value - 2008 value = $211,942 - $50,408 = $161,534
- Percentage decline = (Decline / 2007 value) × 100 = ($161,534 / $211,942) × 100 ≈ 76.24%
