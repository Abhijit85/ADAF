✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what percentage of employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements?",
  "Calculation": "Total employees = 4859 (from text). Employees under collective bargaining = 406 (United Steelworkers) + 299 (IBEW) = 705. Percentage = (705 / 4859) * 100 ≈ 14.51%",
  "Answer": "14.51%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The United Steelworkers: 406 employees
- International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW): 299 employees
- Total employees = 406 + 299 = 705
