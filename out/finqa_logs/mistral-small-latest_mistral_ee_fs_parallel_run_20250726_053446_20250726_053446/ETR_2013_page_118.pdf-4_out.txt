  "Question": "what are the lease obligations to entergy louisiana as a percentage of long-term debt maturities in 2014?",
  "Calculation": "Lease obligations = $149 million (from text). Long-term debt maturities for 2014 not provided in table or text. Calculation cannot be completed without long-term debt maturities data.",
  "Answer": "Insufficient data to calculate the percentage. Long-term debt maturities for 2014 are required.",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```
