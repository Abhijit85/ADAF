✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "in 2008 what was the percent of the total gaap stockholders 2019 equity and aggregate statutory capital associated with life operations",
  "Calculation": "1. Convert Life Operations Surplus to billions: $6047 million = $6.047 billion\n2. Total Statutory Capital and Surplus: $13.8 billion (from text)\n3. Calculate Percentage: (6.047 / 13.8) × 100 = 43.81%",
  "Answer": "43.81%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The table data provided in the question shows a calculation of 43.87%, which is slightly different from the 43.81% derived here. This discrepancy suggests that the "Total in 2008" in the table might be slightly different from the $13.8 billion stated in the text. Clarification on the exact values used in the table would be needed to resolve this discrepancy.
