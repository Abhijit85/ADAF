=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "what would 2014 capital expenditures have been without the early buyout of the operating lease of the headquarters , in millions?",
  "Calculation": "Total cash used in investing activities (2014) = $(4249) million\nEarly buyout of headquarters operating lease = $261 million\nCapital expenditures without early buyout = $(4249) million - $261 million = $(3988) million",
  "Answer": "$3988 million",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- From the table, cash used in investing activities in 2014 is **$(4,249) million**.
- Cash used in investing activities typically includes capital expenditures (CapEx) and other investments (e.g., acquisitions, investments in securities, etc.).
- The early buyout of the operating lease of the headquarters is likely a one-time investment that is part of the cash used in investing activities.
- Since the table does not provide a breakdown of the cash used in investing activities, we cannot directly separate the CapEx from the early buyout of the operating lease. Therefore, we cannot calculate the exact CapEx without the early buyout solely from the given table.
- The table does not provide a breakdown of the cash used in investing activities, so we cannot directly separate the capital expenditures (CapEx) from the early buyout of the operating lease.
- Since the early buyout is part of the total cash used in investing activities, we subtract it from the total to estimate the remaining CapEx.
- **Calculation**: $(4,249) million (total cash used) - $261 million (early buyout) = $(3,988) million.
- However, this assumes that the early buyout is the only non-CapEx item in the investing activities, which may not be accurate. The text mentions other capital investments (e.g., locomotives, freight cars, containers, and projects), but no specific amounts are provided for these.
- A breakdown of the cash used in investing activities (e.g., how much was spent on locomotives, freight cars, containers, and other projects) is needed to accurately isolate the CapEx from the early buyout.
- Without this breakdown, we cannot definitively separate the CapEx from the early buyout.
