✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "as of december 2018 what was the percent of the 2018 program still outstanding",
  "Calculation": "Percentage outstanding = (Remaining amount / Total authorized amount) × 100 = ($2.2 billion / $2.5 billion) × 100 = 0.88 × 100 = 88%",
  "Answer": "88%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The percentage outstanding is the ratio of the remaining shares to the total shares that could be purchased (remaining shares + shares already purchased).
- However, the table does not provide the total shares authorized for purchase under the program, only the remaining dollar value ($2.2 billion).
- Without the total authorized shares or the average price per share for the remaining shares, we cannot directly calculate the percentage outstanding.
- The table does not provide the total number of shares purchased under the 2018 program or the average price per share for the remaining shares.
- Percentage outstanding = (Remaining amount / Total authorized amount) × 100
- Percentage outstanding = ($2.2 billion / $2.5 billion) × 100
- Percentage outstanding = 0.88 × 100
- Percentage outstanding = 88%
