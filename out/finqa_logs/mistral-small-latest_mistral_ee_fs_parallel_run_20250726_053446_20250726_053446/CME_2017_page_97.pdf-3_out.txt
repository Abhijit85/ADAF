=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "how many directors can be elected by the class b-1 and class b-2 shareholders?",
  "Calculation": "The text explicitly states that Class B-1 shareholders elect 3 directors and Class B-2 shareholders elect 2 directors. No further calculations are needed as the numbers are directly provided.",
  "Answer": {
    "Class B-1": 3,
    "Class B-2": 2
  },
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- **Class B-1 common stock authorized, issued and outstanding**: 0.6 (in thousands)
- **Class B-2 common stock authorized, issued and outstanding**: 0.8 (in thousands)
- The number of shares for Class B-1 and Class B-2 is not directly relevant to the number of directors they can elect, as the election rights are explicitly defined in the text.
- **Class B-1 shareholders** elect **3 directors**.
- **Class B-2 shareholders** elect **2 directors**.
- **Class B-1 shareholders** can elect **3 directors**.
- **Class B-2 shareholders** can elect **2 directors**.
---
- **Class B-1 shareholders** can elect **3 directors**.
- **Class B-2 shareholders** can elect **2 directors**.
