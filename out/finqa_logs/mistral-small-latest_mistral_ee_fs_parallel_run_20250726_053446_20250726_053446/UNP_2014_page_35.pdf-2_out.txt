=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the cost per car for the buyout of locomotives in 2012?",
  "Calculation": "Cost per locomotive = Total buyout cost / Number of locomotives = 75000000 / 165 ≈ 454545.45",
  "Answer": "$454545.45",
  "Source": "combined"
}

Answer Echoes:
---
- If the question had asked for the **average cost per locomotive across multiple years**, we would need data on buyouts in other years (e.g., 2013, 2014).
- If the question had asked for the **total capital investments in locomotives**, we would need the full breakdown of investing activities from the table.
