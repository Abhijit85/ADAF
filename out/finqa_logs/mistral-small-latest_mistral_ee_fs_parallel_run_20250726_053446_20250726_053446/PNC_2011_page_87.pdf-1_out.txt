=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "based upon outstanding balances at december 31 , 2011 what was the percent of the principal and interest product of the combined products",
  "Calculation": "1. Total combined products = $13107 million (Interest Only) + $7616 million (Principal and Interest) = $20723 million. 2. Percentage of Principal and Interest Product = ($7616 / $20723) × 100 ≈ 36.75%",
  "Answer": "36.75%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Interest Only Product (2012-2016 and thereafter) = $13,107 million
- Principal and Interest Product (2012-2016 and thereafter) = $7,616 million
- Total combined products = $13,107 + $7,616 = $20,723 million
- (Principal and Interest Product / Total combined products) × 100
- ($7,616 / $20,723) × 100 ≈ 36.75%
- Total combined products = Interest Only Product + Principal and Interest Product
- Total combined products = $13,107 million + $7,616 million = $20,723 million
- Percentage = (Principal and Interest Product / Total combined products) × 100
- Percentage = ($7,616 million / $20,723 million) × 100 ≈ 36.75%
