✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the cash outflow for the repurchase of shares during october 2008?",
  "Calculation": "29704 shares × $5.99/share = (29704 × 5) + (29704 × 0.99) = 148520 + 29406.96 = $177926.96",
  "Answer": "$177926.96",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Total Number of Shares Purchased (October) = 29,704
- Average Price Paid per Share (October) = $5.99
- \( 29,704 \times 5 = 148,520 \)
- \( 29,704 \times 0.99 = 29,704 - 297.04 = 29,406.96 \)
