=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "1. 2001 revenue from large utilities were how many times the revenues from the growth distribution segment?",
  "Calculation": "Large utilities revenue in 2001: $739 million. Growth distribution revenue in 2001: $296 million. Ratio = $739 million / $296 million = 2.4966 (rounded to 2.50)",
  "Answer": "2.50 times",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Large utilities revenue in 2001: $739 million
- Growth distribution revenue in 2001: $296 million
- $739 million / $296 million = 2.4966 (rounded to 2.50 for simplicity)
- Large utilities revenue = $739 million
- Growth distribution revenue = $296 million
- Ratio = Large utilities revenue / Growth distribution revenue
- Ratio = $739 million / $296 million
- Ratio ≈ 2.4966 (rounded to 2.50 for simplicity)
- The calculation is mathematically correct.
- The ratio of 2.50 is reasonable given the provided revenue figures.
- The answer is presented with appropriate precision (rounded to two decimal places).
