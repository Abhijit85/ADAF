✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "in the number of securities to be issued what is the ratio of the stock rights from the 2012 plan to the 2011 plan included in these securities",
  "Calculation": "Ratio = (2012 Plan Stock Rights) / (2011 Plan Stock Rights) = 28763 / 27123 ≈ 1.06",
  "Answer": "1.06:1",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The total number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants, and rights is **448,859**.
- This total includes:
- **2011 Plan**: 27,123 stock rights.
- **2012 Plan**: 28,763 stock rights (plus other types of rights, but we only need stock rights for this calculation).
- The table does not break down the securities by plan, so we rely on the text for the specific numbers.
- **2011 Plan Stock Rights**: 27,123
- **2012 Plan Stock Rights**: 28,763
- If a more precise breakdown of the **2012 Plan** stock rights (excluding other types of rights) is needed, further clarification from the text or additional data may be required. However, the given numbers are sufficient for this calculation.
