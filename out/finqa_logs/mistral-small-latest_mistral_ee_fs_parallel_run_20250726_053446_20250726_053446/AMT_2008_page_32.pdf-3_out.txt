=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "for the quarter ended march 312008 what was the percent of the change from the highest to the lowest of the company per share sale prices of common stock",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the highest and lowest stock prices for the quarter ended March 31, 2008: High = $42.72, Low = $32.10. 2. Calculate the difference: $42.72 - $32.10 = $10.62. 3. Calculate the percentage change: ($10.62 / $42.72) × 100 ≈ 24.86%.",
  "Answer": "24.86%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- High: $42.72
- Low: $32.10
- Difference = High - Low = $42.72 - $32.10 = $10.62
- Percentage Change = (Difference / High) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($10.62 / $42.72) × 100 ≈ 24.86%
- Difference = High - Low = $42.72 - $32.10 = $10.62
- Percentage Change = (Difference / High) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($10.62 / $42.72) × 100 ≈ 24.86%
