=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what would the amount accrued because of interest on the term loan facility after october 29, 2011?",
  "Calculation": "1. Total interest rate = LIBOR (2.42%) + Spread (1.25%) = 3.67%\n2. Annual interest expense = $145000000 × 3.67% = $5326500",
  "Answer": "$5326500",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- LIBOR (as of October 29, 2011) = 2.42%
- Spread = 1.25%
- Total interest rate = 2.42% + 1.25% = 3.67%
- Interest Expense = Principal × Interest Rate
- Interest Expense = $145,000,000 × 3.67% = $145,000,000 × 0.0367 = $5,326,500
