=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "in 2002 what was the ratio of the annual cash sinking fund requirements for debt outstanding that was due in 2004 to 2005",
  "Calculation": "Ratio = 2004 / 2005 = $925005 / $540372 ≈ 1.7118",
  "Answer": 1.7118,
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2004: $925,005
- 2005: $540,372
- Ratio = 2004 / 2005 = $925,005 / $540,372
- Ratio ≈ 1.7118
- 2004: $925,005
- 2005: $540,372
- The table data explicitly provides the required values for 2004 and 2005.
- No additional context from the text is necessary for this calculation, as the question is purely arithmetic based on the table.
- The ratio is greater than 1, which is reasonable since the 2004 requirement ($925,005) is higher than the 2005 requirement ($540,372).
- The calculation is mathematically correct and follows standard ratio computation.
