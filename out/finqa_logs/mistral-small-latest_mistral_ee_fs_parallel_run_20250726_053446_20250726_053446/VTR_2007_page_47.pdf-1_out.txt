=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "Prior to the shares repurchased in 2007, how many shares of common stock were outstanding?",
  "Calculation": "Shares outstanding before repurchase = Shares outstanding after repurchase (138311810) + Shares repurchased (14669) = 138326479",
  "Answer": "138326479",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Total shares outstanding after December 2007 repurchase, or
- Total shares outstanding before December 2007 repurchase.
- The table confirms the repurchase of **14,669 shares** at an average price of $43.89 (though the price is not needed for this calculation).
- Shares outstanding after repurchase (as of February 15, 2008) = **138,311,810**.
- Shares repurchased in December 2007 = **14,669**.
