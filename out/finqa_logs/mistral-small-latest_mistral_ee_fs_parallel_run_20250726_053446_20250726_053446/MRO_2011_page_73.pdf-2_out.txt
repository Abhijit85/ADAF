=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "how much was cost of good sold in 2009?",
  "Calculation": "COGS cannot be calculated from the provided table and text context. Required data (gross profit, operating expenses, or sales data) is missing.",
  "Answer": "Unable to determine COGS for 2009 with the given information.",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Gross profit or operating expenses for 2009.
- Sales data for 2009.
- Any other financial metrics that could help derive COGS.
