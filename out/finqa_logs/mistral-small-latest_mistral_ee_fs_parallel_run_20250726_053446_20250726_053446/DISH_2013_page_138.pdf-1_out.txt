=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the tax expense related to discontinued operations in 2013?",
  "Calculation": "Tax Expense = Income (loss) before tax - Income (loss) after tax = (-54) - (-47) = -7 million (tax benefit)",
  "Answer": "$7 million (benefit)",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Current assets from discontinued operations: $68,239
- Noncurrent assets from discontinued operations: $9,965
- Current liabilities from discontinued operations: $(49,471)
- Long-term liabilities from discontinued operations: $(19,804)
- Net assets from discontinued operations: $8,929
- The table does not provide direct tax expense data, so the calculation relies on the pre-tax and post-tax income figures from the text.
- The negative result indicates a tax benefit, which aligns with the context of resolving an uncertain tax position (as mentioned in the text for 2013).
