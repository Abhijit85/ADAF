=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the variation observed between the tangible and intangible assets , in millions?",
  "Calculation": "Variation = Tangible assets - Intangible assets = $14.0 million - $8.5 million = $5.5 million",
  "Answer": "$5.5 million",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Tangible assets = $14.0 million
- Intangible assets = $8.5 million
- Variation = Tangible assets - Intangible assets
- Variation = $14.0 million - $8.5 million
- Variation = $5.5 million
