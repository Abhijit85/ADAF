=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the change in total debt to be repaid in the contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase obligations at december 31 , 2005 between 2009 and 2008?",
  "Calculation": "$2646 million (2009) - $707 million (2008) = $1939 million",
  "Answer": "$1939 million",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2008: $707 million
- 2009: $2,646 million
- Change = Total (2009) - Total (2008)
- Change = $2,646 million - $707 million
- Change = $1,939 million
- Change = 2009 Total Debt - 2008 Total Debt
- Change = $2,646 million - $707 million
- Change = $1,939 million
