=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "how much was cost of good sold in 2009?",
  "Calculation": "Insufficient data to calculate COGS. Required: Gross profit or breakdown of operating expenses.",
  "Answer": "Additional context required to determine COGS for 2009",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Revenues applicable to discontinued operations: $188 million
- Pretax income from discontinued operations: $80 million
- **Revenues (Discontinued Operations)**: $188 million
- **Pretax Income (Discontinued Operations)**: $80 million
- The table only provides **revenue** and **pretax income** for discontinued operations in 2009.
- **Pretax income** includes all expenses (including COGS, operating expenses, depreciation, etc.), so it cannot be used directly to isolate COGS.
- The text does not provide additional details on COGS or gross profit for 2009.
- If **gross profit** were available, we could compute COGS.
- Since **pretax income** is a net figure after all expenses, it cannot be used to derive COGS without additional breakdowns (e.g., operating expenses, depreciation, etc.).
- The provided data is insufficient to calculate COGS for 2009.
- **Additional context required**:
- Gross profit (or gross margin) for 2009.
- Breakdown of operating expenses, depreciation, or other costs to isolate COGS.
- Gross profit (or gross margin) for 2009.
- Breakdown of operating expenses, depreciation, or other costs to isolate COGS.
