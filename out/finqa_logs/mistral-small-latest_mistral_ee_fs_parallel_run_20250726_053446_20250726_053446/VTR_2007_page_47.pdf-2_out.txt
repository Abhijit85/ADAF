{
  "Question": "what was the number of shares outstanding as of december 31 , 2007",
  "Calculation": "Unable to calculate due to missing data. Required information: initial shares outstanding or total shares issued during the period.",
  "Answer": "Unable to determine",

}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The table shows **14,669 shares repurchased** during the quarter ended December 31, 2007.
- The table does not provide the total shares outstanding before repurchases or any other relevant data (e.g., shares outstanding at the beginning of the period or total shares issued).
- The number of shares outstanding at the beginning of the period (e.g., January 1, 2007) or the total shares issued during the period.
- The number of shares repurchased (14,669) is not sufficient to calculate the outstanding shares as of December 31, 2007, because we do not know the starting point or other changes in shares (e.g., new issuances).
- The number of shares outstanding at the beginning of the period (e.g., January 1, 2007) or the total shares issued during the period.
- Any other changes in shares (e.g., new issuances, other repurchases, or other corporate actions) between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2007.
