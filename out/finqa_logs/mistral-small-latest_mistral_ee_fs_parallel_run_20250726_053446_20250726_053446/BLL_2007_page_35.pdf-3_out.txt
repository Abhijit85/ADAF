✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the total amount of cash outflow used for shares repurchased during november 2007 , in millions?",
  "Calculation": "431170 shares × $48.11/share = $20810000.70 → $20.81 million (rounded to two decimal places)",
  "Answer": "$20.81 million",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- None, as the table and text provide sufficient information for the calculation. The text confirms the repurchase program and authorizations but does not affect the November 2007 calculation.
