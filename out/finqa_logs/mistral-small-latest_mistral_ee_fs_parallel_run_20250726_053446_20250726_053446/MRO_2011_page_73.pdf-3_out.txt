✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the percentage of pretax income from discontinued operations to total revenues from discontinued operations?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the base (total revenues from discontinued operations) = $188 million\n2. Identify the part (pretax income from discontinued operations) = $80 million\n3. Calculate the percentage: (Part / Base) × 100 = (80 / 188) × 100\n4. Perform the division: 80 / 188 ≈ 0.4255\n5. Multiply by 100 to get percentage: 0.4255 × 100 ≈ 42.55%",
