=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "For the Chicago headquarters lease, assuming the two options to extend the term are exercised, what is the last year the space can be leased?",
  "Calculation": "1. Original lease expiration: 2022\n2. First extension (7 years): 2022 + 7 = 2029\n3. Second extension (10 years): 2029 + 10 = 2039",
  "Answer": "2039",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- First extension: 2022 + 1 = 2023
- Second extension: 2023 + 1 = 2024
- None, as the extension terms are explicitly stated in the text (7 years followed by 10 years).
