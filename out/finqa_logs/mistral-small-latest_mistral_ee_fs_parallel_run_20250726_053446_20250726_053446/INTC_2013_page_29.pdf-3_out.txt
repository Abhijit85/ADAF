✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the percent of the square feet in owned facilities in other countries?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the part (Owned facilities in Other Countries) = 16.7 million square feet\n2. Identify the base (Total facilities in Other Countries) = 22.7 million square feet\n3. Calculate the percentage: (16.7 / 22.7) × 100\n4. Perform the division: 16.7 ÷ 22.7 ≈ 0.736\n5. Multiply by 100 to get percentage: 0.736 × 100 ≈ 73.6%",
