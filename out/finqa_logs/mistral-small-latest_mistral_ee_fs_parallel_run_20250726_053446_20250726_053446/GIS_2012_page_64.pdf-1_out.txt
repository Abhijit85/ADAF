✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the total interest expense for the year ending on may 27 , 2012 , ( in millions )",
  "Calculation": "$526.5 million × 2.4% = $12.636 million",
  "Answer": "$12.636 million",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Total Notes Payable = $526.5 million
- Weighted-Average Interest Rate = 2.4%
- Interest Expense = Total Notes Payable × Weighted-Average Interest Rate
- Interest Expense = $526.5 million × 2.4%
- Interest Expense = $526.5 million × 0.024
- Interest Expense = $12.636 million
- None. The required data was fully provided in the table and text context.
