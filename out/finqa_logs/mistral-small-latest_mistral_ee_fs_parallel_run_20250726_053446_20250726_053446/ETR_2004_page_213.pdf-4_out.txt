{
  "Question": "what is the growth rate in net revenue in 2003 for entergy louisiana , inc.?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the net revenues for 2002 and 2003: 2002 net revenue = $922.9 million, 2003 net revenue = $973.7 million. 2. Calculate the difference in net revenue: $973.7 million - $922.9 million = $50.8 million. 3. Calculate the growth rate: ($50.8 million / $922.9 million) × 100 ≈ 5.50%.",
  "Answer": "5.50%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2002 net revenue = $922.9 million
- 2003 net revenue = $973.7 million
- Difference = 2003 net revenue - 2002 net revenue
- Difference = $973.7 million - $922.9 million = $50.8 million
- Growth rate = (Difference / 2002 net revenue) × 100
- Growth rate = ($50.8 million / $922.9 million) × 100 ≈ 5.50%
