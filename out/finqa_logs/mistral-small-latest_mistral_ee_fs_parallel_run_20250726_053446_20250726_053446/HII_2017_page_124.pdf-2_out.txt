✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what portion of the equity compensation plan approved by security holders remains available for future issuance?",
  "Calculation": "1. Total securities under approved plans = 448859 (issued) + 4087587 (remaining) = 4536446\n2. Portion available for future issuance = 4087587 / 4536446 ≈ 0.8999\n3. Percentage = 0.8999 × 100 ≈ 89.99%",
  "Answer": "89.99%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Number of securities to be issued upon exercise (a) = 448,859
- Number of securities remaining available for future issuance (c) = 4,087,587
- Total = 448,859 + 4,087,587 = 4,536,446
- Portion available for future issuance = 4,087,587 / 4,536,446
- Percentage = (4,087,587 / 4,536,446) × 100 ≈ 89.99%
- Total = Securities to be issued (a) + Securities remaining for future issuance (c)
- Total = 448,859 + 4,087,587 = 4,536,446
- Percentage = (Securities remaining for future issuance / Total) × 100
- Percentage = (4,087,587 / 4,536,446) × 100 ≈ 89.99%
