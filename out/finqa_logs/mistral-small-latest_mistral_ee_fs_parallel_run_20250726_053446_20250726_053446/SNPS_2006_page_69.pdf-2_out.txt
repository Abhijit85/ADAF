✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what percentage of the total purchase price is represented by goodwill?",
  "Calculation": "Goodwill = $3.4 million (from text) / Total purchase price = $15.7 million (from text) * 100 = 21.66%",
  "Answer": "21.66%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Total purchase price = $15,704 (in thousands)
- Cash paid = $11,001 (in thousands)
- Prior investment in HPL = $1,872 (in thousands)
- Acquisition-related costs = $2,831 (in thousands)
- **Goodwill**: Explicitly stated as **$3.4 million** (from the text: "goodwill was $3.4 million").
- The table lists a **total purchase price of $15,704 (in thousands)**, which matches the text's $15.7 million.
- The table also lists **goodwill as $0**, but this contradicts the text. The text is the authoritative source here.
- None, as the text explicitly provides the goodwill amount. The table's goodwill value of $0 is likely an error or misalignment with the text. The text is the primary source for this calculation.
