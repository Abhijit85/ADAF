=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percent of the increase in the aons revenues for risk solutions from 2010 to 2011",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the revenue for Risk Solutions in 2010 and 2011: 2011: $6817 million, 2010: $6423 million. 2. Calculate the difference: $6817 - $6423 = $394 million. 3. Calculate the percentage increase: ($394 / $6423) × 100 = 6.13%.",
  "Answer": "6.13%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2011: $6,817
- 2010: $6,423
- $6,817 - $6,423 = $394
- ($394 / $6,423) × 100 = 6.13%
- $6,817 million (2011) - $6,423 million (2010) = $394 million
- ($394 million / $6,423 million) × 100 = 6.13%
