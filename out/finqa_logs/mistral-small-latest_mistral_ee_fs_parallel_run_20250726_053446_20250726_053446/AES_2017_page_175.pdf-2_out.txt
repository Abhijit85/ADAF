=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "for 2017 , what was net interest expense with related parties , in millions?",
  "Calculation": "Net interest expense = Interest expense (2017) - Interest income (2017) = $36 million - $8 million = $28 million",
  "Answer": "$28 million",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Interest income (2017) = $8 million
- Interest expense (2017) = $36 million
