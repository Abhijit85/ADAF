=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the percent change in annual long-term debt maturities from 2018 to 2019?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify values: 2018 = $822690 (in thousands), 2019 = $768588 (in thousands). 2. Calculate difference: $768588 - $822690 = -$54102 (in thousands). 3. Calculate percent change: (-$54102 / $822690) × 100 ≈ -6.58%.",
  "Answer": "-6.58%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2018: $822,690 (in thousands)
- 2019: $768,588 (in thousands)
- Difference = 2019 value - 2018 value = $768,588 - $822,690 = -$54,102 (in thousands)
- Percent Change = (Difference / 2018 value) × 100
- Percent Change = (-$54,102 / $822,690) × 100 ≈ -6.58%
