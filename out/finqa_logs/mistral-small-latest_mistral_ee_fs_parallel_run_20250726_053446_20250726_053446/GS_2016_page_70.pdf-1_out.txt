=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the net change in the number of staff in 2016?",
  "Calculation": "Net change = Staff in 2016 - Staff in 2015 = 34400 - 36800 = -2400",
  "Answer": "-2400 (a decrease of 2400 staff)",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- None, as the table data provides all necessary information for this calculation. The text context about operating expenses and compensation is not directly relevant to the staff count calculation.
