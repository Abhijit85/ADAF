✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage change in revenues from 2016 to 2017 for transactions with related parties?",
  "Calculation": "The table does not provide specific revenue figures for 'transactions with related parties' for 2016 and 2017. Therefore, the percentage change cannot be calculated without this data.",
  "Answer": "Additional Context Required",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2017 Revenue (Non-Regulated) = $1,297
- 2016 Revenue (Non-Regulated) = $1,100
- Difference = $1,297 - $1,100 = $197
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2016 Revenue) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($197 / $1,100) × 100 ≈ 17.91%
- Revenue from related party transactions for 2016.
- Revenue from related party transactions for 2017.
