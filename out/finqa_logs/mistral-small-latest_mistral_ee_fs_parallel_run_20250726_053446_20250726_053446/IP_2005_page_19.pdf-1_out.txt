=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the change in industry segment operating profits between 2004 and 2005?",
  "Calculation": "2005 Industry segment operating profits ($1923 million) - 2004 Industry segment operating profits ($2040 million) = -$117 million",
  "Answer": "-$117 million",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Change = 2005 value - 2004 value
- Change = $1,923 million - $2,040 million
- Change = -$117 million
