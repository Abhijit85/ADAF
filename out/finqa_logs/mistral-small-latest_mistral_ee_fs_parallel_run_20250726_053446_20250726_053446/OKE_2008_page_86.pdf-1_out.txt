=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the total net change in net fair value of derivatives outstanding at between 2007 and 2008 in thousands?",
  "Calculation": "Net change = Net fair value at December 31, 2008 - Net fair value at December 31, 2007 = $258800 - $25171 = $233629 (thousands of dollars)",
  "Answer": "233629",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Net change = Net fair value at December 31, 2008 - Net fair value at December 31, 2007
- Net change = $258,800 - $25,171
- Net change = $233,629 (thousands of dollars)
