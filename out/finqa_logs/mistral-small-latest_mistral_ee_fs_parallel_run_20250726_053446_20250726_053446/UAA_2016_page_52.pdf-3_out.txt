=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what percent of total operating income was emea in 2015?",
  "Calculation": "1. EMEA 2015 operating income: $3122000 (from $3.1 million text and $3122 in table, both consistent when converted to same units). 2. Total operating income 2015: $408547000 (from table value in thousands). 3. Percentage calculation: (3122000 / 408547000) × 100 = 0.764%.",
  "Answer": "0.764%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- EMEA 2015 = $3.1 million = $3,100,000.
- Ratio = EMEA 2015 / Total Operating Income 2015
- Ratio = $3,100,000 / $408,547,000 ≈ 0.00764.
- Percentage = 0.00764 × 100 ≈ 0.764%.
