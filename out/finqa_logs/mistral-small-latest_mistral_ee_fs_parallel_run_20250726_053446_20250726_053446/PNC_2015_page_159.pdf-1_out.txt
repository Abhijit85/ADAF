=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "At December 31, 2015, what was the net change from December 31, 2014, on all total purchased impaired loans in billions?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the ALLL values for 2015 and 2014 from the text context: December 31, 2015: $0.3 billion, December 31, 2014: $0.9 billion. 2. Calculate the net change: Net change = December 31, 2015 - December 31, 2014 = $0.3 billion - $0.9 billion = -$0.6 billion.",
  "Answer": "-$0.6 billion",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- December 31, 2015: $1,250 million
- December 31, 2014: $1,558 million
- Net change = December 31, 2015 - December 31, 2014
- Net change = $1,250 million - $1,558 million
- Net change = -$308 million
- Net change = -$0.308 billion
- December 31, 2015: $0.3 billion
- December 31, 2014: $0.9 billion
- Net change = December 31, 2015 - December 31, 2014
- Net change = $0.3 billion - $0.9 billion
- Net change = -$0.6 billion
