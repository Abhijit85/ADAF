=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage change in the common stock and option",
  "Calculation": "Percentage change calculation requires both current and previous values. Current total common stock and options: 22203 (in thousands). Previous value not provided in table or text. Therefore, calculation cannot be performed.",
  "Answer": "Additional context required: Previous value of common stock and options needed to calculate percentage change.",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Common stock under stock and option plans: 21,829
- Common stock under the Vertex Purchase Plan: 249
- Common stock under the Vertex 401(k) Plan: 125
- Total: 22,203
