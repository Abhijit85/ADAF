{
  "Question": "what is the percentage change in amortization expense from from 2007 to 2008?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the amortization expenses for 2007 and 2008:\n   - 2007: $92.0 million\n   - 2008: $90.5 million\n2. Calculate the difference in amortization expense between 2007 and 2008:\n   - Difference = $90.5 million - $92.0 million = -$1.5 million\n3. Calculate the percentage change:\n   - Percentage Change = (Difference / 2007 Amortization) * 100\n   - Percentage Change = (-$1.5 million / $92.0 million) * 100\n   - Percentage Change ≈ -1.63%",
  "Answer": "-1.63%",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2007: $92.0 million
- 2008: $90.5 million
- Difference = $90.5 million - $92.0 million = -$1.5 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2007 Amortization) * 100
- Percentage Change = (-$1.5 million / $92.0 million) * 100
- Percentage Change ≈ -1.63%
