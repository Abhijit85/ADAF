=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "by how much did the expected annual dividends per share increase from 2005 to 2007?",
  "Calculation": "2007 dividend ($0.96) - 2005 dividend ($0.66) = $0.30",
  "Answer": "$0.30",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2005: $0.66
- 2007: $0.96
- $0.96 - $0.66 = $0.30
- 2005: $0.66
- 2007: $0.96
- $0.96 (2007) - $0.66 (2005) = $0.30
