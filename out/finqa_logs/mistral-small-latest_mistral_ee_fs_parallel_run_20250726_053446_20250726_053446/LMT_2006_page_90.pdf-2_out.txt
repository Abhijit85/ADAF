✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage change in the rental expense under operating leases from 2004 to 2005",
  "Calculation": "Percentage Change = (($324 million - $318 million) / $318 million) * 100 = (6 / 318) * 100 ≈ 1.89%",
  "Answer": "1.89%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2004: $318 million
- 2005: $324 million
- Difference = $324 million - $318 million = $6 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2004 Expense) * 100
- Percentage Change = ($6 million / $318 million) * 100 ≈ 1.89%
