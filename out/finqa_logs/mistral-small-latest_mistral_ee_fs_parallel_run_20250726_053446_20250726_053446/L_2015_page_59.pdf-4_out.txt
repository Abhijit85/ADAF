=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the percentage reduction in the loews common stock from 2013 to 2014",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify values: 2013 = 126.23, 2014 = 110.59\n2. Calculate difference: 110.59 - 126.23 = -15.64\n3. Calculate percentage reduction: (-15.64 / 126.23) × 100 ≈ -12.39%",
  "Answer": "-12.39%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2013: 126.23
- 2014: 110.59
- Difference = 110.59 - 126.23 = -15.64
- Percentage Reduction = (Difference / 2013) × 100
- Percentage Reduction = (-15.64 / 126.23) × 100 ≈ -12.39%
- Difference = 110.59 - 126.23 = -15.64
- Percentage Reduction = (Difference / 2013) × 100
- Percentage Reduction = (-15.64 / 126.23) × 100 ≈ -12.39%
