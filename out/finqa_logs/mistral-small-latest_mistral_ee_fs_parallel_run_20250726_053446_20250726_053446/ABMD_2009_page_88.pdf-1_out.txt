=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what are the total contingent payments relating to impella?",
  "Calculation": "The total contingent payments are calculated by summing the amounts specified in the text for Impella-related milestones: $5583333 (Impella 2.5 FDA approval) + $5583333 (Impella 5.0 FDA approval) + $5583334 (sale of 1000 units) = $16750000.",
  "Answer": "$16750000",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Balance at March 31, 2008: $168
- Reductions for tax positions: $(168)
- Balance at March 31, 2009: $0
- The table shows a reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits, which is unrelated to the contingent payments for Impella. The table data provided is not relevant to the contingent payments question.
- Payment for Impella 2.5 FDA approval: $5,583,333
- Payment for Impella 5.0 FDA approval: $5,583,333
- Payment for sale of 1,000 units: $5,583,334
