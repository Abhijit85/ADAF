{
  "Question": "what was the percentage increase total commitments to extend credit and other commitments",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the values for 'Total commitments to extend credit and other commitments' for both years: 2018: $181612 million, 2017: $172521 million. 2. Calculate the difference: 181612 - 172521 = 9091 million. 3. Calculate the percentage increase: (9091 / 172521) × 100 ≈ 5.27%.",
  "Answer": "5.27%",

}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2018: $181,612 million
- 2017: $172,521 million
- Difference = 181,612 - 172,521 = 9,091 million
- Percentage Increase = (Difference / 2017 value) × 100
- Percentage Increase = (9,091 / 172,521) × 100 ≈ 5.27%
- Difference = 181,612 - 172,521 = 9,091 million
- Percentage Increase = (Difference / 2017 value) × 100
- Percentage Increase = (9,091 / 172,521) × 100 ≈ 5.27%
