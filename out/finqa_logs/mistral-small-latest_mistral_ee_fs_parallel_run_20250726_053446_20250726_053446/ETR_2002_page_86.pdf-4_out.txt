=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the sum of the notes entergy issued to nypa with seven and eight annual payment installments",
  "Calculation": "1. Seven annual installments: 7 × $108 million = $756 million\n2. Eight annual installments: 8 × $20 million = $160 million\n3. Total sum: $756 million + $160 million = $916 million",
  "Answer": "$916 million",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Seven annual payment installments correspond to the year 2007 (the 7th year in the sequence).
- Eight annual payment installments correspond to the year 2008 (the 8th year in the sequence).
- Entergy issued notes to NYPA with:
- **Seven annual installments** of approximately **$108 million** each, commencing **one year from the closing date**.
- **Eight annual installments** of **$20 million** each, commencing **eight years from the closing date**.
- The **implicit interest rate** is **4.8%**, but this is not needed for the sum calculation.
- The table provides debt maturities up to **2007**, but the question does not specify the closing date.
- Since the table does not cover the full period (e.g., 2008 for the 8th installment), we must rely on the text for exact values.
- Each installment = **$108 million**
- Total for seven installments = **7 × $108 million = $756 million**
- Each installment = **$20 million**
- Total for eight installments = **8 × $20 million = $160 million**
- **$756 million (7 installments) + $160 million (8 installments) = $916 million**
- If the closing date were known, we could verify whether the table includes the relevant years. However, since the table only goes up to 2007 and the 8th installment starts in the 8th year, the text provides the exact values needed.
