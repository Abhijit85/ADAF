=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the growth rate in based rent for hudson yards , new york facility in the third period?",
  "Calculation": "Growth Rate = ((74 - 66) / 66) × 100 = 12.12%",
  "Answer": "12.12%",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The table lists years in order: 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and "Thereafter."
- The third period is **2020** (since 2018 is the first, 2019 is the second, and 2020 is the third).
- The fourth period is **2021**.
- Amount in 2020 (third period): **126**
- Amount in 2021 (fourth period): **118**
- Growth Rate = [(Amount in 2021 - Amount in 2020) / Amount in 2020] × 100
- Growth Rate = [(118 - 126) / 126] × 100
- Growth Rate = [-8 / 126] × 100
- Growth Rate = -6.35%
- Third period (2033–2037): $66 million/year.
- Fourth period (2038–2043): $74 million/year.
- The table data provided in the initial question does not directly align with the text description of the Hudson Yards lease. The table appears to reference different financial commitments (e.g., "126" and "118" in 2020 and 2021, respectively), which may not pertain to the Hudson Yards base rent. The correct growth rate is derived from the text context, as the table data does not match the lease terms described.
