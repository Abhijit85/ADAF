✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what percentage of the board of directors approved budget was capital expenditures?",
  "Calculation": "1. Total budget = $3521 million (from table).\n2. Capital expenditures (CE) components:\n   - North America E&P: $2885 million\n   - International E&P: $536 million\n   - Oil Sands Mining: $21 million\n   - Corporate and other: $79 million\n3. Sum of CE = $2885 + $536 + $21 + $79 = $3521 million\n4. Percentage of CE = ($3521 / $3521) × 100 = 100%",
  "Answer": "100%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- North America E&P: $2,885 million
- International E&P: $536 million
- Oil Sands Mining: $21 million
- Corporate and other: $79 million (assuming this is part of CE, though the table labels it separately).
- CE = $2,885 + $536 + $21 = $3,442 million.
- Percentage = ($3,442 / $3,521) × 100 ≈ 97.75%.
- Clarification on whether "Corporate and Other" ($79 million) is considered a capital expenditure. If excluded, the calculation would be:
