=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the change in defined contribution plans expenses for the u.s . between 2015 and 2016 in millions?",
  "Calculation": "Change = 2016 expense - 2015 expense = $42.5 million - $40.2 million = $2.3 million",
  "Answer": "$2.3 million",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2015: $40.2 million
- 2016: $42.5 million
- Change = 2016 expense - 2015 expense
- Change = $42.5 million - $40.2 million
- Change = $2.3 million
