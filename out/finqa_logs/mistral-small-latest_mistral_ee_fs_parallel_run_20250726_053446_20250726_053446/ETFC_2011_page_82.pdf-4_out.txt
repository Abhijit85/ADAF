{
  "Question": "as of december 31 2011 what was the ratio of the good will reported in the capital markets to the retail bank",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the goodwill values for Capital Markets and Retail Bank from the table: Capital Markets goodwill = $142.4 million, Retail Bank goodwill = $40.6 million. 2. Calculate the ratio of Capital Markets goodwill to Retail Bank goodwill: Ratio = 142.4 / 40.6 = 3.51",
  "Answer": "3.51",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Capital Markets goodwill = $142.4
- Retail Bank goodwill = $40.6
- Ratio = Capital Markets goodwill / Retail Bank goodwill
- Ratio = 142.4 / 40.6
- Ratio ≈ 3.51
- Capital Markets goodwill = $142.4 million
- Retail Bank goodwill = $40.6 million
- Ratio = Capital Markets goodwill / Retail Bank goodwill
- Ratio = 142.4 / 40.6
- Ratio ≈ 3.51
