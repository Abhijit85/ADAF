=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what percentage of total future minimum operating lease payments for leases with remaining terms greater than one year are due in 2009?",
  "Calculation": "1. Total future minimum operating lease payments for leases with remaining terms greater than one year: $249038 million. 2. Amount due in 2009: $63060 million. 3. Percentage calculation: (63060 / 249038) * 100 = 25.32%",
  "Answer": "25.32%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Total lease payments = $249,038 million.
- 2009 lease payments = $63,060 million.
- The calculation is mathematically correct.
- The result is reasonable, as 25.32% of the total lease payments being due in 2009 is a plausible distribution over the five-year period.
- The units are consistent (millions), and the percentage is correctly formatted to two decimal places.
