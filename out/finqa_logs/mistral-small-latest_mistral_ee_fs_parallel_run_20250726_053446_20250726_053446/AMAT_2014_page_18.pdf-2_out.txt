=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what are the total sales reported in 2012 , ( in billion ) ?",
  "Calculation": "Given R&D expenses in 2012 were $1.2 billion (14% of net sales). Let S_2012 be net sales for 2012. Then, 0.14 * S_2012 = 1.2 billion. Solving for S_2012: S_2012 = 1.2 / 0.14 ≈ 8.571 billion.",
  "Answer": "8.57 billion",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- We know that in 2012, R&D expenses were $1.2 billion and this represented 14% of net sales.
- Let \( S_{2012} \) be the net sales for 2012.
- The relationship is: \( 0.14 \times S_{2012} = 1.2 \) billion.
- Solving for \( S_{2012} \):
- The net sales for 2013 were $2.372 billion, and R&D was 18% of net sales, which is $1.3 billion. This is consistent with the given data.
- The net sales for 2014 were $1.4 billion / 0.16 = $8.75 billion, which is also consistent with the growth trend.
- The table data provided does not include the net sales for 2012, so the calculation relies on the R&D expenses and their percentage of net sales as given in the text context.
- The calculation assumes that the R&D expenses and their percentage of net sales are accurate and consistent with the company's financial reporting.
