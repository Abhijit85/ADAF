=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage change in the expenses related to the issuing of stock option in 2009",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify stock option expenses: 2009 = $21 million, 2008 = $24 million. 2. Calculate difference: $21 - $24 = -$3 million. 3. Calculate percentage change: (-$3 / $24) * 100 = -12.5%.",
  "Answer": "-12.5%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2009: $21
- 2008: $24
- Difference = 2009 value - 2008 value = $21 - $24 = -$3
- Percentage change = (Difference / 2008 value) × 100
- Percentage change = (-$3 / $24) × 100 = -12.5%
- Difference = 2009 value - 2008 value = $21 million - $24 million = -$3 million
- Percentage change = (Difference / 2008 value) × 100
- Percentage change = (-$3 million / $24 million) × 100 = -12.5%
