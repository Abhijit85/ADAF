=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the spread between the high and low henry hub natural gas ( dollars per mcf ) in 2009?",
  "Calculation": "The table provides only a single value ($3.99 per mcf) for Henry Hub natural gas in 2009, which is insufficient to calculate a spread. The text context does not provide the high or low prices for 2009, nor any additional data points to infer the spread.",
  "Answer": "Insufficient data to calculate the spread.",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The text mentions that "prices were volatile in 2009, but not as much as in the previous year."
- It also states that "the price decrease continued into 2009, but reversed after dropping below $33.98 in February, ending the year at $79.36." However, this appears to refer to crude oil prices, not Henry Hub natural gas prices.
- High and low Henry Hub natural gas prices for 2009.
- Monthly or quarterly price data for 2009 that could be used to infer the spread.
