✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "for all of 2011 , approximately how much was spent on stock repurchases?",
  "Calculation": "Total amount spent = Total shares repurchased × Average price per share = 15340810 × $96.08 = $1627353124.80",
  "Answer": "$1627353124.80",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Total Number of Shares Purchased = 3,915,795
- Average Price Paid Per Share = $98.19
- 15,340,810 × 100 = 1,534,081,000
- 15,340,810 × 6 = 92,044,860
- 15,340,810 × 0.08 = 1,227,264.80
- 1,534,081,000 + 92,044,860 = 1,626,125,860
- 1,626,125,860 + 1,227,264.80 = 1,627,353,124.80
- None, as the text explicitly provides the full-year repurchase data. The table data is for a subset (Q4 2011) and is not needed for the full-year calculation.
