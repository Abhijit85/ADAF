=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage change in cash capital investments in track from 2005 to 2006?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify values: 2005 = $1472 million, 2006 = $1487 million. 2. Calculate difference: 1487 - 1472 = 15 million. 3. Calculate percentage change: (15 / 1472) × 100 ≈ 1.02%.",
  "Answer": "1.02%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2006: $1,487 million
- 2005: $1,472 million
- Difference = 1,487 - 1,472 = 15 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2005 Value) × 100
- Percentage Change = (15 / 1,472) × 100 ≈ 1.02%
- Difference = 2006 Value - 2005 Value
- Difference = $1,487 million - $1,472 million = $15 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2005 Value) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($15 million / $1,472 million) × 100 ≈ 1.02%
