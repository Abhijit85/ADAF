{
  "Question": "what is the growth rate in net revenue in 2016?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the net revenue for 2015 and 2016: 2015 net revenue = $1666 million, 2016 net revenue = $1542 million. 2. Calculate the difference in net revenue: Difference = 2016 net revenue - 2015 net revenue = $1542 - $1666 = -$124 million. 3. Calculate the growth rate: Growth rate = (Difference / 2015 net revenue) × 100 = (-$124 / $1666) × 100 ≈ -7.44%.",
  "Answer": "-7.44%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2015 net revenue = $1,666 million
- 2016 net revenue = $1,542 million
- Difference = 2016 net revenue - 2015 net revenue = $1,542 - $1,666 = -$124 million
- Growth rate = (Difference / 2015 net revenue) × 100
- Growth rate = (-$124 / $1,666) × 100 ≈ -7.44%
- Difference = 2016 Net Revenue - 2015 Net Revenue
- Difference = $1,542 million - $1,666 million = -$124 million
- Growth Rate = (Difference / 2015 Net Revenue) × 100
- Growth Rate = (-$124 million / $1,666 million) × 100 ≈ -7.44%
- The negative sign indicates a decline in net revenue, which aligns with the text context mentioning a decrease of approximately $124 million.
- The calculation is mathematically correct and reasonable given the provided data.
