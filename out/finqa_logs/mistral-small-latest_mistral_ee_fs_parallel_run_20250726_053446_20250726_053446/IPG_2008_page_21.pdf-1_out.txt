}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Total spent in October = Number of shares × Price per share
- Total spent in October = 29,704 × $5.99 = $177,752.96
- Total spent in November = Number of shares × Price per share
- Total spent in November = 4,468 × $3.24 = $14,478.72
- Difference = Total spent in October - Total spent in November
- Difference = $177,752.96 - $14,478.72 = $163,274.24
- Percentage increase = (Difference / Total spent in November) × 100
- Percentage increase = ($163,274.24 / $14,478.72) × 100 ≈ 1,127.78%
- Total spent in October = Number of shares × Price per share
- Total spent in October = 29,704 × $5.99 = $177,752.96
- Total spent in November = Number of shares × Price per share
- Total spent in November = 4,468 × $3.24 = $14,478.72
- Difference = Total spent in October - Total spent in November
- Difference = $177,752.96 - $14,478.72 = $163,274.24
- Percentage increase = (Difference / Total spent in November) × 100
- Percentage increase = ($163,274.24 / $14,478.72) × 100 ≈ 1,127.78%
