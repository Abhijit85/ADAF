=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percent of the change in the net revenues from dec . 282012 dec . 29 2013",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify net revenues: Dec. 28, 2013 = $52708 million, Dec. 29, 2012 = $53341 million. 2. Calculate difference: $52708 - $53341 = -$633 million. 3. Calculate percentage change: (-$633 / $53341) × 100 ≈ -1.19%.",
  "Answer": "-1.19%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Net revenue (Dec. 28, 2013) = $52,708 million
- Net revenue (Dec. 29, 2012) = $53,341 million
- Difference = $52,708 - $53,341 = -$633 million
- Percentage change = (Difference / Net revenue (Dec. 29, 2012)) × 100
- Percentage change = (-$633 / $53,341) × 100 ≈ -1.19%
