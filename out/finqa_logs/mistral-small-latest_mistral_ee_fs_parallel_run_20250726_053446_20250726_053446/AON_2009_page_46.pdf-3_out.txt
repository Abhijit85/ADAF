=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percent of the change in the risk and insurance brokerage services segment revenue from 2008 2009",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the segment revenue for 2008 and 2009: 2009 Revenue = $6305 million, 2008 Revenue = $6197 million. 2. Calculate the difference: $6305 - $6197 = $108 million. 3. Calculate the percentage change: ($108 / $6197) × 100 ≈ 1.74%.",
  "Answer": "1.74%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2009 Revenue = $6,305
- 2008 Revenue = $6,197
- Difference = $6,305 - $6,197 = $108
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2008 Revenue) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($108 / $6,197) × 100 ≈ 1.74%
- Difference = 2009 Revenue - 2008 Revenue
- Difference = $6,305 - $6,197 = $108 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2008 Revenue) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($108 / $6,197) × 100 ≈ 1.74%
