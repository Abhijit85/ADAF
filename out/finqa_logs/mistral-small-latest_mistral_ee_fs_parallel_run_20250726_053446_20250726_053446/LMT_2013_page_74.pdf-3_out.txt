=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the change in the weighted average common shares outstanding for diluted computations from 2011 to 2012 , in millions?",
  "Calculation": "Weighted average common shares outstanding for diluted computations: 2011 = 339.9 million, 2012 = 328.4 million. Change = 328.4 million - 339.9 million = -11.5 million",
  "Answer": "-11.5 million",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2011: 339.9 million
- 2012: 328.4 million
- 328.4 - 339.9 = -11.5 million
- Difference = 2012 shares - 2011 shares
- Difference = 328.4 million - 339.9 million
- Difference = -11.5 million
