=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "considering the years 2013 and 2014 , what is the basis point variation observed in the operating margin?",
  "Calculation": "1. Extract operating margins from text context (prioritized due to detail): 2014 = 21.0%, 2013 = 19.8%. 2. Calculate difference: 21.0% - 19.8% = 1.2%. 3. Convert to basis points: 1.2% × 100 = 120 basis points.",
  "Answer": "120 basis points",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2014 Operating Margin = 11.4%
- 2013 Operating Margin = 7.8%
- Difference = 11.4% - 7.8% = 3.6%
- 3.6% × 100 = 360 basis points
- 2014 Operating Margin = 21.0%
- 2013 Operating Margin = 19.8%
- Difference = 21.0% - 19.8% = 1.2%
- 1.2% × 100 = 120 basis points
- The table data provided in the question contradicts the text context. Clarification is needed to determine which source is correct. The text context is more detailed and likely accurate, so the answer is based on that. If the table data is correct, the answer would be 360 basis points as initially calculated. However, the text explicitly states the operating margins as 21.0% (2014) and 19.8% (2013), leading to a 120 basis point difference.
