=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the change in the balance of liability for restructuring 2003 program from 2006 to 2008 , ( in millions ) ?",
  "Calculation": "Change in liability = Liability at December 31, 2008 - Liability at December 31, 2006 = $5.7 million - $12.6 million = -$6.9 million",
  "Answer": "-$6.9 million",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Liability at December 31, 2006 (2003 Program) = $12.6 million
- Liability at December 31, 2008 (2003 Program) = $5.7 million
- Change in liability = Liability at December 31, 2008 - Liability at December 31, 2006
- Change in liability = $5.7 million - $12.6 million
- Change in liability = -$6.9 million
