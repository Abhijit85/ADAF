=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what portion of the long-term debt is reported under the current liabilities section of balance sheet as of september 27 , 2008?",
  "Calculation": "The portion of long-term debt reported under current liabilities is the amount due within the next year, which is explicitly given as $38480 in the table. No further calculations are needed as the value is directly provided.",
  "Answer": "$38480",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Long-Term Debt Obligations (Less than 1 year) = $38,480
- Total Long-Term Debt Obligations = $2,200,900
- The question pertains to the portion of long-term debt reported under current liabilities as of September 27, 2008. The text does not provide additional context that would alter the table data.
