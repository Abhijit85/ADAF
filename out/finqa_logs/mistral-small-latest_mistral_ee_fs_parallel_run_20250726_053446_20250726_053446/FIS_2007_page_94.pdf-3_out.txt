=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the percentage change in rent expense from 2006 to 2007?",
  "Calculation": "Percentage Change = ((2007 Rent Expense - 2006 Rent Expense) / 2006 Rent Expense) * 100 = (($106.4 million - $81.5 million) / $81.5 million) * 100 ≈ 30.55%",
  "Answer": "30.55%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2006 Rent Expense = $81.5 million
- 2007 Rent Expense = $106.4 million
- Difference = 2007 Rent Expense - 2006 Rent Expense
- Difference = $106.4 million - $81.5 million = $24.9 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2006 Rent Expense) * 100
- Percentage Change = ($24.9 million / $81.5 million) * 100 ≈ 30.55%
