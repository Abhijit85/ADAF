✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage of the total severance actions related to our aeronautics , space systems , and our is&gs business segments and corporate headquarters in 2011 related to the aeronautics",
  "Calculation": "Percentage = (Aeronautics Severance / Total Severance) * 100 = (49 / 136) * 100 ≈ 36.03%",
  "Answer": "36.03%",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
---
- If the question intended to include **Corporate Headquarters** separately, the breakdown would need to be adjusted (e.g., if Corporate Headquarters had a separate severance amount). However, the text does not specify a separate figure for Corporate Headquarters in 2011, so it is included in the total $136 million.
