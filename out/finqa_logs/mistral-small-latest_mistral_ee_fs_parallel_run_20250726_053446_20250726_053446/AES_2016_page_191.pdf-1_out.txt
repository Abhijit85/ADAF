=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage change in the unrecognized tax benefits from 2014 to 2015?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the unrecognized tax benefits for 2014 and 2015 from the table: 2014: $394 million, 2015: $373 million. 2. Calculate the difference: $373 million - $394 million = -$21 million. 3. Calculate the percentage change: (-$21 million / $394 million) × 100 ≈ -5.33%.",
  "Answer": "-5.33%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2014: $394
- 2015: $373
- Difference = $373 - $394 = -$21
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2014 Value) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-$21 / $394) × 100 ≈ -5.33%
