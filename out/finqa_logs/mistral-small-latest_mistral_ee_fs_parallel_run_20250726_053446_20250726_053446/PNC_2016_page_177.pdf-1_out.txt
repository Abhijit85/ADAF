=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "as of december 31 , 2016 what was the percent of the total commercial lending of the total commitments to extend credit and other commitments",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the part (Total commercial lending) = $108256 million\n2. Identify the base (Total commitments to extend credit and other commitments) = $163897 million\n3. Calculate the percentage: (108256 / 163897) × 100\n4. Perform the division: 108256 / 163897 ≈ 0.6599\n5. Multiply by 100 to get percentage: 0.6599 × 100 ≈ 65.99%",
