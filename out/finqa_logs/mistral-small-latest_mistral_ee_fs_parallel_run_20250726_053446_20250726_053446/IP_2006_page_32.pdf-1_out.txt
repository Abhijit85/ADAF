=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "in 2006 what percentage of consumer packaging sales were represented by foodservice net sales?",
  "Calculation": "Total Consumer Packaging Net Sales = Coated Paperboard Net Sales + Foodservice Net Sales = $1.5 billion + $396 million = $1.896 billion. Percentage = (Foodservice Net Sales / Total Consumer Packaging Net Sales) * 100 = ($396 million / $1.896 billion) * 100 ≈ 20.89%",
  "Answer": "20.89%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The table does not provide the total consumer packaging net sales or foodservice net sales directly. The table only includes "Sales" and "Operating Profit" for the years 2006, 2005, and 2004, but it does not break down these figures into specific categories like consumer packaging or foodservice.
- The text does not provide the total consumer packaging net sales directly. However, it mentions that coated paperboard net sales were $1.5 billion in 2006 and foodservice net sales were $396 million in 2006. Assuming these are the only two segments under consumer packaging (as no other segments are mentioned), the total consumer packaging net sales would be the sum of these two:
- Total Consumer Packaging Net Sales = Coated Paperboard Net Sales + Foodservice Net Sales
- Total Consumer Packaging Net Sales = $1.5 billion + $396 million = $1.896 billion.
- The percentage is calculated as:
- (Foodservice Net Sales / Total Consumer Packaging Net Sales) * 100
- ($396 million / $1.896 billion) * 100
- (396 / 1,896) * 100 ≈ 20.89%
- The exact total consumer packaging net sales for 2006 is not provided directly in the text or table. The calculation assumes that coated paperboard and foodservice are the only segments under consumer packaging. If there are other segments not mentioned, the total consumer packaging net sales would be higher, and the percentage would be lower. Clarification on the composition of consumer packaging net sales would be needed for a more precise answer.
