=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "In 2009, what was the change in the allowance for doubtful accounts?",
  "Calculation": "Change = Ending Balance (2009) - Beginning Balance (2009) = $55.2 million - $65.7 million = -$10.5 million",
  "Answer": "-$10.5 million (a decrease of $10.5 million in the allowance for doubtful accounts in 2009)",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Balance at beginning of 2009: $65.7
- Balance at end of 2009: $55.2
- Change = Balance at end of 2009 - Balance at beginning of 2009
- Change = $55.2 - $65.7 = -$10.5
- Change = Ending Balance (2009) - Beginning Balance (2009)
- Change = $55.2 million - $65.7 million
- Change = -$10.5 million
