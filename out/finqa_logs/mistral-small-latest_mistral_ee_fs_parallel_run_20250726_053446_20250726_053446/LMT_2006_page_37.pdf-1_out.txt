=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "for the the quarter ended december 31 , 2006 what was the percent of the total number of shares purchased bought in october",
  "Calculation": "Total shares purchased in Q4 2006 = 447700 (October) + 849200 (November) + 929400 (December) = 2226300. Percentage of October shares = (447700 / 2226300) × 100 ≈ 20.11%",
  "Answer": "20.11%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- October: 447,700
- November: 849,200
- December: 929,400
- **Total** = 447,700 + 849,200 + 929,400 = 2,226,300
- October: 447,700
- (447,700 / 2,226,300) × 100 ≈ 20.11%
