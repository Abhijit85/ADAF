=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "in 2005 what percentage of consumer packaging sales were represented by foodservice net sales?",
  "Calculation": "1. 2005 Consumer Packaging Net Sales = $1.5 billion / (1 + 0.09) = $1.376 billion\n2. 2005 Foodservice Net Sales = $437 million\n3. Percentage = (437 / 1376) * 100 ≈ 31.72%",
  "Answer": "31.72%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The text states: *"Consumer packaging net sales increased 9% compared with 2005."*
- However, the exact 2005 net sales figure is not provided directly. Instead, we see:
- **2006 Consumer Packaging Net Sales**: $1.5 billion (from the table).
- Since sales increased by 9% from 2005 to 2006:
- The text states: *"Foodservice net sales declined to $396 million in 2006, compared with $437 million in 2005."*
- Thus, **2005 Foodservice Net Sales = $437 million**.
- The table does not provide a breakdown of consumer packaging sales into subcategories (e.g., foodservice, coated paperboard, etc.). Therefore, we rely on the text for this information.
---
- As derived above: **≈ $1.376 billion** (or **$1,376 million**).
- Given directly: **$437 million**.
---
---
- If the question required a breakdown of other subcategories (e.g., coated paperboard), additional data would be needed from the text or table. However, the given question only asks for the foodservice percentage, which is fully answerable with the provided information.
