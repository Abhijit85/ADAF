✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "Considering the second quarter of 2017, what is the average sale price per share of the company 2019s common stock?",
  "Calculation": "Average = (High + Low) / 2 = ($28.65 + $21.76) / 2 = $50.41 / 2 = $25.205 → $25.21 (rounded to the nearest cent)",
  "Answer": "$25.21",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- High price (2017, Second Quarter) = $28.65
- Low price (2017, Second Quarter) = $21.76
- None. The table data and text context provided sufficient information to answer the question. The text clarifies that the prices are adjusted for the reverse stock split and that pre-separation prices are not comparable, but this does not affect the calculation for the second quarter of 2017.
