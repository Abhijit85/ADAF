=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the increase in long-term debt between 2004 and 2005 in thousands?",
  "Calculation": "2005 Long-term debt ($3451276) - 2004 Long-term debt ($3155228) = $296048; $296048 / 1000 = 296.048",
  "Answer": "296.048",

```

Answer Echoes:
- 2005 Long-term debt: $3,451,276
- 2004 Long-term debt: $3,155,228
- $3,451,276 - $3,155,228 = $296,048
- $296,048 / 1,000 = 296.048
