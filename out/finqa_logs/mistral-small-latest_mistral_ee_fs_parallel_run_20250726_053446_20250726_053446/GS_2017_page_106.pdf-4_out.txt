=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was change in millions for the estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in credit spreads on derivatives ( including hedges ) between 2017 and 2016?",
  "Calculation": "2017 value ($3 million) - 2016 value ($2 million) = $1 million",
  "Answer": "$1 million",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2017: $3 million
- 2016: $2 million
- Change = 2017 value - 2016 value
- Change = $3 million - $2 million
- Change = $1 million
