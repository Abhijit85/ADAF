=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the interest from 2017 to 2025 as a percentage of the total long-term borrowings?",
  "Calculation": "1. Total Interest (2017–2025) = $24M + $89M + $62M + $29M + $36M + $10M = $250M\n2. Total Long-Term Borrowings = $4915M\n3. Percentage = ($250 / $4915) × 100 ≈ 5.09%",
  "Answer": "5.09%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2017: $724 (Fair Value) - $700 (Carrying Value) = $24
- 2019: $1,086 - $997 = $89
- 2021: $808 - $746 = $62
- 2022: $775 - $746 = $29
- 2024: $1,030 - $994 = $36
- 2025: $742 - $732 = $10
- **Total Interest**: $24 + $89 + $62 + $29 + $36 + $10 = $250 million
- (Total Interest / Total Long-term Borrowings) × 100
- ($250 / $4,915) × 100 ≈ 5.09%
---
- If the table had not provided the Fair Value and Carrying Value differences, we would need to extract the interest rates and remaining terms from the text to calculate the interest payments explicitly. However, the table already provides the necessary data for this calculation.
