✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "in 2019 what was the percent of the total future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations associated with long-term debt that was due in 2020",
  "Calculation": "1396.3 / 13093.0 = 0.1066; 0.1066 * 100 = 10.66%",
  "Answer": "10.66%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 1,396.3 / 13,093.0 ≈ 0.1066
- 0.1066 × 100 ≈ 10.66%
