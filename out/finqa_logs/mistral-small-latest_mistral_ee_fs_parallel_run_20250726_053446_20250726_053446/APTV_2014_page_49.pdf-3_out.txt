=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the difference between the highest and lowest return for the first year of the investment?",
  "Calculation": "Highest return: Delphi Automotive PLC ($0.98)\nLowest return: Automotive Supplier Peer Group (-$10.73)\nDifference = $0.98 - (-$10.73) = $0.98 + $10.73 = $11.71",
  "Answer": "$11.71",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Delphi Automotive PLC: $100.98 - $100.00 = $0.98
- S&P 500: $100.80 - $100.00 = $0.80
- Automotive Supplier Peer Group: $89.27 - $100.00 = -$10.73
- Highest return: Delphi Automotive PLC ($0.98)
- Lowest return: Automotive Supplier Peer Group (-$10.73)
- Difference = Highest return - Lowest return
- Difference = $0.98 - (-$10.73) = $0.98 + $10.73 = $11.71
