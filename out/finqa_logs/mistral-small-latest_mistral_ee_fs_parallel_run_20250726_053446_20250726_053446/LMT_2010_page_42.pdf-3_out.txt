=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the net change in cash in 2010?",
  "Calculation": "Net Change in Cash (2010) = Operating Cash Flow + Investing Cash Flow + Financing Cash Flow = $3547 million + (-$319 million) + (-$3363 million) = $3547 million - $319 million - $3363 million = -$135 million",
  "Answer": "-$135 million",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Operating Cash Flow = $3,547 million
- Investing Cash Flow = -$319 million
- Financing Cash Flow = -$3,363 million
- $3,547 + (-$319) + (-$3,363) = $3,547 - $319 - $3,363
- $3,547 - $3,682 = -$135 million
