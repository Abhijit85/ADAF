✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what portion of the estimated purchase price of r2 is paid in cash?",
  "Calculation": "Cash paid = $6900; Total purchase price = $220600; Percentage = (6900 / 220600) * 100 ≈ 3.13%",
  "Answer": "$6900 (3.13%)",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- **Total estimated purchase price**: $220,600 (in thousands)
- **Breakdown of purchase price**:
- **Cash paid**: $6,900
- **Shares of Hologic common stock**: $205,500
- **Debt assumed**: $5,700
- **Acquisition-related fees and expenses**: $2,500
- The text explicitly states that **$6,900** was paid in cash.
- **Cash portion of the purchase price**: **$6,900** (or **3.13%** of the total purchase price).
- None, as the text provides the exact cash payment amount.
