=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "at december 31 , 2013 what was the percent of square feet of our office in alpharetta , georgia not leased",
  "Calculation": "Total square footage in Alpharetta: 254000 sq ft. Unleased square footage: 165000 sq ft. Percentage unleased = (165000 / 254000) * 100 = 65.04%",
  "Answer": "65.04%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The text explicitly states: *"all facilities are leased, except for 165,000 square feet of our office in Alpharetta, Georgia."*
- This means **165,000 sq ft** of the Alpharetta office is **not leased**.
