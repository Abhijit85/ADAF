=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "including the shares repurchased under the december 2007 repo agreement , what was the total authorized shares ( in millions ) eligible for repurchase under the january 23 , 2008 repurchase authorization?",
  "Calculation": "The January 23, 2008 repurchase authorization is a new, standalone authorization of 12 million shares, replacing all previous authorizations. The December 2007 repurchase agreement (8310 shares) is not part of this new authorization.",
  "Answer": "12 million",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The "Maximum Number of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs" as of December 31, 2007 is **4,465,344** shares.
- The shares repurchased under the December 2007 repurchase agreement are **8,310** shares (as noted in the footnote (c)).
- On **January 23, 2008**, Ball’s board authorized the repurchase of **up to 12 million shares** of common stock.
- This authorization **replaces all previous authorizations**, meaning it is a new, standalone authorization.
- If the question intended to include the **December 2007 repurchases** in the total, the answer would be **12,008,310 shares (12.00831 million)**. However, the text states the January 2008 authorization **replaces all previous authorizations**, implying it is a new, separate authorization.
