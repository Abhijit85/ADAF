=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage change in investment banking fees from 2005 to 2006?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the investment banking fees for 2005 and 2006 from the table: 2005: $4088 million, 2006: $5520 million. 2. Calculate the difference: $5520 - $4088 = $1432 million. 3. Calculate the percentage change: ($1432 / $4088) × 100 ≈ 35.03%.",
  "Answer": "35.03%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2005: $4,088 million
- 2006: $5,520 million
- Difference = $5,520 - $4,088 = $1,432 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2005 value) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($1,432 / $4,088) × 100 ≈ 35.03%
- Difference = $5,520 million - $4,088 million = $1,432 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2005 value) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($1,432 million / $4,088 million) × 100 ≈ 35.03%
