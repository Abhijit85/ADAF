=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the percentage increase in total stock-based compensation expense from 2009 to 2010?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the total stock-based compensation expense for 2009 and 2010 from the table: 2009: $209 million, 2010: $221 million. 2. Calculate the difference: $221 million - $209 million = $12 million. 3. Calculate the percentage increase: ($12 million / $209 million) × 100 ≈ 5.74%.",
  "Answer": "5.74%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2009: $209
- 2010: $221
- Difference = $221 - $209 = $12
- Percentage Increase = (Difference / 2009 Value) × 100
- Percentage Increase = ($12 / $209) × 100 ≈ 5.74%
- Difference = $221 million - $209 million = **$12 million**.
- Percentage Increase = (Difference / 2009 Value) × 100
- Percentage Increase = ($12 million / $209 million) × 100 ≈ **5.74%**.
