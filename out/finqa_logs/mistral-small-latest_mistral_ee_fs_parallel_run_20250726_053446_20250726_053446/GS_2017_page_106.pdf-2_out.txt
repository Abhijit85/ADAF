✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what percentage of total market risk for positions , accounted for at fair value , that are not included in var is comprised of equity in 2017?",
  "Calculation": "Percentage = (Equity / Total Market Risk) × 100 = ($2096 million / $3702 million) × 100 ≈ 56.6%",
  "Answer": "56.6%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Equity: $2,096 million
- Debt: $1,606 million
- Total: $3,702 million
- Part (Equity) = $2,096 million
- Base (Total) = $3,702 million
- (Part / Base) × 100 = ($2,096 / $3,702) × 100
- $2,096 / $3,702 ≈ 0.566
- 0.566 × 100 ≈ 56.6%
- Part (Equity) = $2,096 million
- Base (Total market risk) = $3,702 million
- Percentage = (Part / Base) × 100
- Percentage = ($2,096 / $3,702) × 100
- Percentage ≈ 0.566 × 100
- Percentage ≈ 56.6%
