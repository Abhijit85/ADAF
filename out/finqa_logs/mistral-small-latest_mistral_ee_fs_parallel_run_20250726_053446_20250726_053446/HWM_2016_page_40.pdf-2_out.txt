=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "Considering the year 2016, what was the percentual increase in the high sale price observed during the first and second quarters?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the high sale prices for Q1 and Q2 2016: Q1 = $30.66, Q2 = $34.50. 2. Calculate the difference: $34.50 - $30.66 = $3.84. 3. Calculate the percentage increase: ($3.84 / $30.66) × 100 ≈ 12.52%.",
  "Answer": "12.52%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- First Quarter High: $30.66
- Second Quarter High: $34.50
- Difference = $34.50 - $30.66 = $3.84
- Percentage Increase = (Difference / First Quarter High) × 100
- Percentage Increase = ($3.84 / $30.66) × 100 ≈ 12.52%
- The table data for the high sale prices of Q1 and Q2 2016 must be explicitly provided or referenced to confirm the values used in the calculation. The text context mentions that the prices are adjusted for the reverse stock split but does not provide the specific values. Thus, the table data is critical for this calculation.
