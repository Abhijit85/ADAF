✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what portion of total assets acquired is composed of goodwill?",
  "Calculation": "Goodwill = $13536; Total assets acquired = $19427; Ratio = 13536 / 19427 ≈ 0.6967; Percentage = 0.6967 × 100 ≈ 69.67%",
  "Answer": "69.67%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Goodwill = $13,536
- Total assets acquired = $19,427
- Ratio = Goodwill / Total assets acquired
- Ratio = $13,536 / $19,427 ≈ 0.6967
- Percentage = 0.6967 × 100 ≈ 69.67%
