=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage change of our accrued trade liabilities in 2019 compared to 2018",
  "Calculation": "Percentage change = ((484 - 500) / 500) * 100 = (-16 / 500) * 100 = -3.2%",
  "Answer": "-3.2%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2018: $500 million
- 2019: $484 million
- Difference = 2019 value - 2018 value = $484 million - $500 million = -$16 million
- Percentage change = (Difference / 2018 value) * 100
- Percentage change = (-$16 million / $500 million) * 100 = -3.2%
