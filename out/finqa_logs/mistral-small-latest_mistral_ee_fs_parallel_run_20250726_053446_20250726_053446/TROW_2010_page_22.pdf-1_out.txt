=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percent change in capital gain distributions between 2008 and 2009?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify values: 2008 = $5.6 million, 2009 = $2.0 million. 2. Calculate difference: $2.0 - $5.6 = -$3.6 million. 3. Apply percentage change formula: (-$3.6 / $5.6) × 100 = -64.29%.",
  "Answer": "-64.29%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2008: $5.6
- 2009: $2.0
- ( -$3.6 / $5.6 ) × 100 = -64.29%
- Difference = 2009 value - 2008 value = $2.0 million - $5.6 million = -$3.6 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / Original Value) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-$3.6 million / $5.6 million) × 100
- Percentage Change = -0.642857 × 100
- Percentage Change ≈ -64.29%
