=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "at december 31 , what was the percentage change in investment income from 2011 to 2012",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify pre-tax investment income: 2011 = $620.0 million, 2012 = $600.2 million. 2. Calculate difference: $600.2 - $620.0 = -$19.8 million. 3. Calculate percentage change: (-$19.8 / $620.0) × 100 ≈ -3.19%.",
  "Answer": "-3.19%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2011: $620.0 million
- 2012: $600.2 million
- Difference = $600.2 - $620.0 = -$19.8 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2011 Value) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-$19.8 / $620.0) × 100 ≈ -3.19%
