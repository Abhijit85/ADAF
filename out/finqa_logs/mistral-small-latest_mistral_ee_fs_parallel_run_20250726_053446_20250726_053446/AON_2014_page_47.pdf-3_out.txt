=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the total operating income in 2013 , ( in millions ) ?",
  "Calculation": "From the text context: 2014 operating income = $1.6 billion = 1600 million. Increase from 2013 to 2014 = $108 million. Therefore, 2013 operating income = 1600 million - 108 million = 1492 million. The table data of 318 million is inconsistent with this calculation and likely incorrect.",
  "Answer": "1492 million",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2014 operating income = $1.6 billion = 1,600 million.
- Increase from 2013 to 2014 = $108 million.
- Therefore, 2013 operating income = 1,600 million - 108 million = 1,492 million.
- Clarification on the table data's "318" value, as it contradicts the text's calculation. If the table is correct, the text's numbers may need revisiting.
