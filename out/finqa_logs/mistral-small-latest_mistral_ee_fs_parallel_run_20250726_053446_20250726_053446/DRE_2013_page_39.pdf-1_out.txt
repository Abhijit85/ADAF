✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "in 2012 what was the percent of the total second generation capital expenditures by reportable operating segment that was office related",
  "Calculation": "1. Total second generation capital expenditures (2012): $63884000\n2. Office-related expenditures (2012): $30092000\n3. Percentage calculation: (30092 / 63884) × 100 = 47.09%",
  "Answer": "47.09%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The calculation is mathematically correct.
- The result is reasonable given the context (office-related expenditures are a significant portion of total expenditures).
- The answer is presented with appropriate precision (two decimal places).
