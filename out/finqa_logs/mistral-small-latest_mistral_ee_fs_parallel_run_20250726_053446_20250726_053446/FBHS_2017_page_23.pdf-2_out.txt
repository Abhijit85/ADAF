=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage growth in sales of cabinets from 2016 to 2017",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify sales: 2017 = $2467.1 million, 2016 = $2397.8 million. 2. Calculate difference: 2467.1 - 2397.8 = 69.3 million. 3. Calculate percentage growth: (69.3 / 2397.8) × 100 ≈ 2.89%.",
  "Answer": "2.89%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2017: $2,467.1 million
- 2016: $2,397.8 million
- Difference = 2,467.1 - 2,397.8 = 69.3 million
- Percentage Growth = (Difference / 2016 Sales) × 100
- Percentage Growth = (69.3 / 2,397.8) × 100 ≈ 2.89%
- Difference = 2,467.1 - 2,397.8 = 69.3 million
- Percentage Growth = (Difference / 2016 Sales) × 100
- Percentage Growth = (69.3 / 2,397.8) × 100 ≈ 2.89%
