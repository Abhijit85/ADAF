{
  "Question": "in 2009 what was the company 2019s consolidated net sales in billions",
  "Calculation": "The question asks for 2019 consolidated net sales, but no 2019 data is available. For 2009, the calculation is: Let C be the company's consolidated net sales in 2009. Given that $7.1 billion (Mobile Devices) is 32% of C, we solve: C = 7.1 / 0.32 = 22.1875 billion. Rounded to two decimal places: 22.19 billion.",
  "Answer": "The company's consolidated net sales in 2009 were $22.19 billion. The 2019 consolidated net sales cannot be determined from the given information.",
