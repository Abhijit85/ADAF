=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what the percentage increase defined contribution plans for foreign countries and contribution from 2007 to 2008",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify contributions: 2007 = $26.7 million, 2008 = $28.7 million. 2. Calculate difference: $28.7M - $26.7M = $2.0M. 3. Calculate percentage increase: ($2.0M / $26.7M) * 100 ≈ 7.49%.",
  "Answer": "7.49%",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2007: $26.7 million
- 2008: $28.7 million
- Difference = $28.7 million - $26.7 million = $2.0 million
- Percentage Increase = (Difference / 2007 Contribution) * 100
- Percentage Increase = ($2.0 million / $26.7 million) * 100 ≈ 7.49%
