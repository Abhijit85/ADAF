=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percent of the purchase obligations in 2006 set aside for the contract for the purchase of pulpwood, logs and wood chips",
  "Calculation": "The text states that $2.4 billion was allocated for pulpwood, logs, and wood chips in 2006. However, the total purchase obligations for 2006 are not provided in either the table or the text. Without the total purchase obligations, the percentage cannot be calculated.",
  "Answer": "Unable to calculate: Total purchase obligations for 2006 are required.",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The text states: *"the 2006 amount includes $2.4 billion for contracts made in the ordinary course of business to purchase pulpwood, logs, and wood chips."*
- This means the $2.4 billion is part of the total purchase obligations for 2006.
- The table does not provide the total, but the text implies that the $2.4 billion is a subset of the total.
- However, the exact total is not given in the provided data, so we cannot compute the percentage directly.
- If we assume the $2.4 billion is the only specified portion of the 2006 purchase obligations, we cannot calculate the percentage without the total.
- The text does not provide the total purchase obligations for 2006, so the calculation is incomplete.
