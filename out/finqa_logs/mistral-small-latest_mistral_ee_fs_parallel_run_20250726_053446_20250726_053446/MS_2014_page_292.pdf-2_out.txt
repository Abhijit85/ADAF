=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "accrued interest represented how much of the ending balance in uncertain tax benefits as of december 31 , 2014?",
  "Calculation": "Accrued interest = $258 million (from text context). Total unrecognized tax benefits = $2200 million (from text context). Ratio = (258 / 2200) * 100 ≈ 11.73%.",
  "Answer": "$258 million (11.73%)",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Balance at December 31, 2014: $2,228
- The table does not explicitly break down the $2,228 million (December 31, 2014) balance into accrued interest and other components.
- The text states that accrued interest at December 31, 2014, was **$258 million**.
- This is the amount of interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits that has been accrued but not yet recognized in the financial statements.
- Total unrecognized tax benefits (December 31, 2014) = **$2,200 million**.
- Accrued interest = **$258 million**.
- **Ratio of accrued interest to total unrecognized tax benefits**:
- If the table had provided a breakdown of the $2,228 million balance (e.g., accrued interest vs. principal), a more precise calculation could have been performed. However, the text explicitly states the accrued interest amount, so this is the most accurate figure available.
