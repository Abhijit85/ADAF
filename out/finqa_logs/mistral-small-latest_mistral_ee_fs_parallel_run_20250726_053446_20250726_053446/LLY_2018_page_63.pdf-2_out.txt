=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage change in raw materials and supplies between 2017 and 2018?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify values: 2018 = $506.5 million, 2017 = $488.8 million. 2. Calculate difference: $506.5 - $488.8 = $17.7 million. 3. Calculate percentage change: ($17.7 / $488.8) × 100 ≈ 3.62%.",
  "Answer": "3.62%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2018: $506.5
- 2017: $488.8
- Difference = 506.5 - 488.8 = 17.7
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2017 Value) × 100
- Percentage Change = (17.7 / 488.8) × 100 ≈ 3.62%
- Difference = $506.5 million - $488.8 million = $17.7 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2017 Value) × 100
- Percentage Change = ($17.7 million / $488.8 million) × 100 ≈ 3.62%
