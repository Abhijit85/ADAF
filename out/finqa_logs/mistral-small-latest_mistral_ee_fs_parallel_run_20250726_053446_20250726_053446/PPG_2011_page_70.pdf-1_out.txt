=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "Assuming the same trend as in 2011, what would total stock-based compensation cost be for 2012?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify 2011 stock-based compensation cost: $36 million\n2. Calculate 2011 trend (decrease from 2010): ($52M - $36M) / $52M = 30.77% decrease\n3. Apply 2011 trend to 2011 value: $36M * (1 - 0.3077) = $24.92M\n4. Round to nearest million: $25 million",
  "Answer": "$25 million",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- From 2010 to 2011, the stock-based compensation cost decreased from **$52 million to $36 million**, a **decrease of $16 million (30.77%)**.
- From 2009 to 2010, the cost increased from **$34 million to $52 million**, an **increase of $18 million (52.94%)**.
- The question assumes the **same trend as in 2011**, meaning we apply the **2011 trend (decrease of 30.77%)** to the 2011 value.
- **Calculation**:
- Financial figures are typically rounded to the nearest million.
- **Final Estimate**: **$25 million**
---
- If the trend were based on a different year (e.g., 2010’s increase), the calculation would differ.
- If additional data (e.g., 2012 actual figures) were available, the estimate could be refined.
