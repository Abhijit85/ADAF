=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "if there were a 200bp rise in rates , how much more would the impact be on earnings in 2009 vs . 2008?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the impact of a 200bp rise in rates for 2009 and 2008 from the table: 2009: $(1594) million, 2008: $336 million. 2. Calculate the difference in impact between 2009 and 2008: Difference = Impact in 2009 - Impact in 2008 = $(1594) - $336 = -1594 - 336 = -1930 million.",
  "Answer": "-$1930 million",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2009: $(1,594) million
- 2008: $336 million
- Difference = Impact in 2009 - Impact in 2008
- Difference = $(1,594) - $336
- Difference = -1,594 - 336 = -1,930 million
- 2009: $(1,594) million (negative impact)
- 2008: $336 million (positive impact)
- Difference = Impact in 2009 - Impact in 2008
- Difference = $(1,594) - $336
- Difference = -1,594 - 336 = -1,930 million
- None, as the table provides all necessary data and the text confirms the interpretation of the table values.
