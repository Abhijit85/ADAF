=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the average future minimum annual rental payment for the next five years?",
  "Calculation": "The 'Thereafter' value from the table is $9934 (in thousands), which represents the annual rental payment beyond the explicitly listed years (2008-2012). Assuming this value applies uniformly to each of the next five years, the average future minimum annual rental payment is $9934.",
  "Answer": "$9934 (in thousands)",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The text context does not provide additional numerical data relevant to this calculation, but it does highlight potential financial risks (e.g., legal proceedings) that could impact future rental payments. However, these risks do not affect the calculation of the average rental payment based on the given data.
- The answer is reasonable because the "Thereafter" value is the only available data point for future payments, and assuming it applies to the next five years is a straightforward approach. No additional data or context is needed to adjust this calculation.
