✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what percent of assets acquired by the acquisition are non-tangible assets?",
  "Calculation": "1. Total Assets Acquired: $19427\n2. Non-Tangible Assets: $13536 (Goodwill) + $4091 (Customer-related) + $1031 (Contract-based) = $18658\n3. Percentage Calculation: ($18658 / $19427) × 100 = 95.99%",
  "Answer": "95.99%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Goodwill: $13,536
- Customer-related intangible assets: $4,091
- Contract-based intangible assets: $1,031
- Total non-tangible assets = $13,536 + $4,091 + $1,031 = $18,658
- ($18,658 / $19,427) × 100 = 95.99%
