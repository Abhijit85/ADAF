=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what were total operating expenses in 2013?",
  "Calculation": "Operating Expenses = Revenue - Net Income = $40678 million - $2526 million = $38152 million",
  "Answer": "$38152 million",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Revenue = $40,678 million
- Net Income = $2,526 million
- Operating Expenses = $40,678 million - $2,526 million
- Operating Expenses = $38,152 million
- None. The provided table data and formula were sufficient to derive the answer. The text context was not directly needed for this calculation but provided valuable background on valuation methods and pro-forma adjustments.
