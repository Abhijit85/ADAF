=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what percentage of total future minimum lease payments are due in 2008?",
  "Calculation": "((1371000 / 4819000) * 100) = 28.45%",
  "Answer": "28.45%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The exact total future minimum lease payments ($4,819,000) is assumed from the table data. If this value is not accurate or needs verification, the calculation would need to be adjusted accordingly. The text does not explicitly state this total, so confirmation from the full table or additional context would be ideal.
