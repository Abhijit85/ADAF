=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the percentage of allowance of the company's purchased distressed loan portfolio at december 31 , 2010?",
  "Calculation": "The net carrying amount of the purchased distressed loan portfolio at December 31, 2010 is $392 million (after deducting the $77 million allowance). The percentage of allowance relative to the net carrying amount is calculated as (77 / 392) * 100 = 19.64%.",
  "Answer": "19.64%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Allowance = $77 million
- Carrying amount of loan receivable = $469 million
- Clarification on whether the carrying amount in the table ($469 million) is gross or net. The text explicitly states the net carrying amount is $392 million, so the calculation should use the net amount.
