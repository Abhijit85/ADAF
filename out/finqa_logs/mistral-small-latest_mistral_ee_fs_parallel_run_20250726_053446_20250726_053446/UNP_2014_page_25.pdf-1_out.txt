=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "if the fuel surcharge grows by the same rate as in 2014 what would expected 2015 revenues be in billions?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify 2014 fuel surcharge revenue: $2.8 billion (from text). 2. Identify 2014 growth rate for fuel surcharge: 6% (from text). 3. Apply growth rate to 2014 revenue: $2.8 billion × 1.06 = $2.968 billion. 4. Round to two decimal places: $2.97 billion.",
  "Answer": "$2.97 billion",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2015 Revenue = 2014 Revenue × (1 + Growth Rate)
- 2015 Revenue = $23,988 million × 1.09
- 2015 Revenue = $26,127.92 million
- 2015 Fuel Surcharge Revenue = 2014 Fuel Surcharge Revenue × (1 + Growth Rate)
- 2015 Fuel Surcharge Revenue = $2.8 billion × 1.06
- 2015 Fuel Surcharge Revenue = $2.968 billion
