=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the difference in dollars of the high low sale price for the common stock in the fourth quarter of 2002?",
  "Calculation": "Difference = High - Low = $3.57 - $0.95 = $2.62",
  "Answer": "$2.62",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- High: $3.57
- Low: $0.95
- Difference = High - Low = $3.57 - $0.95 = $2.62
- Difference = High - Low = $3.57 - $0.95
- Difference = $2.62
- The calculation is straightforward subtraction, and the result is mathematically correct.
- The difference of $2.62 is reasonable given the high and low prices provided.
