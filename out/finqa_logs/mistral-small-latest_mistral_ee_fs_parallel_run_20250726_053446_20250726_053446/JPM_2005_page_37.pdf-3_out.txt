=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "without the asset & wealth management segment in 2015 , what would total operating income have been in us$ millions?",
  "Calculation": "The required data for 2015 (total operating income and Asset & Wealth Management operating income) is missing from the provided table and text context. Therefore, the calculation cannot be performed.",
  "Answer": "Cannot be determined with the given information",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Total operating income (2005) = $10,521 million
- Asset & Wealth Management (2005) = $1,216 million
- The table provided only includes data for 2005, not 2015. To answer the question, we need the total operating income for 2015 and the operating income for the Asset & Wealth Management segment in 2015.
- The text context does not provide these specific numbers for 2015.
- Total operating income for 2015.
- Operating income for the Asset & Wealth Management segment in 2015.
