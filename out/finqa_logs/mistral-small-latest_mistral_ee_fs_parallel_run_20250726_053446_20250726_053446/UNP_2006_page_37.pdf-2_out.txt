=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the anticipated percentage increase in the capital investment in 2007 from 2006",
  "Calculation": "Percentage Increase = ((3200 - 2242) / 2242) * 100 = (958 / 2242) * 100 ≈ 42.73%",
  "Answer": "42.73%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- **Base (2006 Total Investment)**: $2,242 million
- **Part (Anticipated 2007 Investment)**: Since the table does not provide the 2007 data, we cannot calculate the exact percentage increase. However, if we assume the question is asking for the percentage increase from 2006 to 2007 based on a hypothetical or projected value, we would need that value.
- The formula for percentage increase is:
- Without the 2007 investment value, this calculation cannot be completed.
- Since the table does not provide the 2007 investment data, we cannot determine the anticipated percentage increase.
- $3.2 billion = $3,200 million.
- $3,200 million (2007) - $2,242 million (2006) = $958 million.
