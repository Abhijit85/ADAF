=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the percentage of the common stock repurchase among the total program of repurchases?",
  "Calculation": "Total share repurchase authorization (2017 Program) = $2.25 billion. All repurchases under this program were for common stock: $1.5 billion (ASR) + $750 million (open market) = $2.25 billion. Therefore, the percentage of common stock repurchases is (2.25 / 2.25) * 100 = 100%.",
  "Answer": "100%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- **$2.25 billion** (approved on February 14, 2017, expiring December 31, 2017).
- **February 2017 ASR (Accelerated Share Repurchase)**:
- **$1.5 billion** repurchased via ASR with Goldman Sachs.
- **Total shares received**: 6.67 million (5.83 million initially + 0.84 million upon final settlement).
- **Open Market Repurchases**:
- **$750 million** remaining after the ASR.
- **Shares repurchased**: 3.04 million.
- **6.67 million (ASR) + 3.04 million (open market) = 9.71 million shares**.
- **$1.5 billion (ASR) + $750 million (open market) = $2.25 billion** (matches the authorization).
- **$2.25 billion** (as per the authorization).
- **$1.5 billion (ASR) + $750 million (open market) = $2.25 billion** (all repurchases were common stock).
- Since all repurchases were common stock, the percentage is **100%**.
- If the question intended to compare common stock repurchases to other types of repurchases (e.g., preferred stock), the text does not mention any other types of repurchases. Thus, the answer remains **100%**.
