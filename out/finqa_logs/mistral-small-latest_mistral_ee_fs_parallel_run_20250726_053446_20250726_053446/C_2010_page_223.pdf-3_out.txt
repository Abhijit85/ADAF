=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "in 2010 what was the percentage change of the carrying amount of loan receivable net of the allowance",
  "Calculation": "1. Beginning net carrying amount = $920M (carrying amount) - $95M (allowance) = $825M\n2. Ending net carrying amount = $469M (carrying amount) - $77M (allowance) = $392M\n3. Percentage change = [(Ending net - Beginning net) / Beginning net] × 100 = [($392M - $825M) / $825M] × 100 = (-$433M / $825M) × 100 = -52.48%",
  "Answer": "-52.48%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Beginning balance (net) = Carrying amount - Allowance = $920M - $95M = $825M
- Ending balance (net) = Carrying amount - Allowance = $469M - $77M = $392M
- Percentage change = [(Ending net - Beginning net) / Beginning net] × 100
- = [($392M - $825M) / $825M] × 100
- = [(-$433M) / $825M] × 100
- = -52.48%
- Beginning net = $825M
- Ending net = $392M
- Change = Ending net - Beginning net = $392M - $825M = -$433M
- Percentage change = (Change / Beginning net) × 100
- = (-$433M / $825M) × 100
- = -52.48%
