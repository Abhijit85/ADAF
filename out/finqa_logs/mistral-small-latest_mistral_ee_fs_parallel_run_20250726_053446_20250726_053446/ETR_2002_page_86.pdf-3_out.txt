=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what are the annual other sinking fund requirements as a percentage of annual long-term debt maturities (excluding lease obligations) and annual cash sinking fund requirements for debt outstanding in 2007?",
  "Calculation": "Unable to compute due to missing data in table and insufficient context for 2007. Required values (annual other sinking fund requirements, long-term debt maturities, and cash sinking fund requirements for 2007) are not provided in the available information.",
  "Answer": "Unable to determine due to missing data in the table and insufficient context for 2007.",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The text mentions that "other sinking fund requirements" are approximately **$30.2 million annually** (as of December 31, 2002).
- These requirements may be satisfied by cash or by certification of property additions at **167%** of such requirements.
- However, the text does not provide specific figures for **2007** or the **annual long-term debt maturities (excluding lease obligations)** and **annual cash sinking fund requirements** for 2007.
- The table provided does not contain the specific figures needed for the calculation (i.e., annual other sinking fund requirements, long-term debt maturities, and cash sinking fund requirements for 2007).
- The table only lists financial figures for 2003–2007 without clear labels, making it impossible to extract the required data.
- **Annual other sinking fund requirements (2007)** = $X million
- **Annual long-term debt maturities (excluding lease obligations, 2007)** = $Y million
- **Annual cash sinking fund requirements (2007)** = $Z million
- The **annual other sinking fund requirements for 2007**.
- The **annual long-term debt maturities (excluding lease obligations) for 2007**.
- The **annual cash sinking fund requirements for 2007**.
