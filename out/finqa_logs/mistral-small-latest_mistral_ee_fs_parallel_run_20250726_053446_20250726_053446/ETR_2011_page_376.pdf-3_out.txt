✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the average price per gwh for the variance in volume?",
  "Calculation": "The variance in volume is 721 GWh (from text context). The Volume/weather variance is 21.3 million (from table). Average price per GWh = Volume/weather variance / Volume increase = 21.3 million / 721 GWh ≈ 0.0295 million per GWh = 29500 per GWh.",
  "Answer": "29500 per GWh",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The table data referenced in the initial example (e.g., "Retail electric price" of 36.0 million) does not directly apply to this question, as the question focuses on the "Volume/weather variance" and its relationship to the GWh increase. The correct approach uses the 721 GWh increase from the text context.
