=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "in 2009 what was the ratio of the commercial mortgages at fair value to lower of cost or market",
  "Calculation": "Ratio = Fair Value / Lower of Cost or Market = 1050 / 251 ≈ 4.183",
  "Answer": "4.18",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Commercial mortgages at fair value (2009) = $1,050 million
- Commercial mortgages at lower of cost or market (2009) = $251 million
- Ratio = Fair Value / Lower of Cost or Market
- Ratio = 1,050 / 251 ≈ 4.183
- Fair Value = $1,050 million
- Lower of Cost or Market = $251 million
- Ratio = Fair Value / Lower of Cost or Market
- Ratio = 1,050 / 251 ≈ 4.183
