=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the net effect of the one-percentage point increase and decrease on total service and interest cost components",
  "Calculation": "Net Effect = $7367 (increase) + $(5974) (decrease) = $7367 - $5974 = $1393",
  "Answer": "$1393",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- One-Percentage-Point Increase: $7,367
- One-Percentage-Point Decrease: $(5,974)
