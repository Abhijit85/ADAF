=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "in millions for 2013 , what were net trading assets 2013 debt and equity instruments?",
  "Calculation": "Net trading assets = Trading assets (debt and equity instruments, 2013) - Trading liabilities (debt and equity instruments, 2013) = $340449 million - $77706 million = $262743 million",
  "Answer": "$262743 million",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Trading assets (debt and equity instruments, 2013) = $340,449 million
- Trading liabilities (debt and equity instruments, 2013) = $77,706 million
- Net trading assets = Trading assets - Trading liabilities
- Net trading assets = $340,449 million - $77,706 million
- Net trading assets = $262,743 million
