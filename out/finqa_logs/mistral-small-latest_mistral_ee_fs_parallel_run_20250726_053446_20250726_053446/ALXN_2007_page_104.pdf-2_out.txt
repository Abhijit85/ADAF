✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the percent change in minimum annual rental payment between 2010 and 2011?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify values: 2010 = $3160, 2011 = $3200\n2. Calculate difference: $3200 - $3160 = $40\n3. Calculate percent change: ($40 / $3160) × 100 ≈ 1.2658%\n4. Round to two decimal places: 1.27%",
  "Answer": "1.27%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2010: $3,160
- 2011: $3,200
- Difference = $3,200 - $3,160 = $40
- Percent Change = (Difference / 2010 Value) × 100
- Percent Change = ($40 / $3,160) × 100 ≈ 1.2658%
