=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage difference in sold receivables from 2007 to 2008?",
  "Calculation": "Percentage Difference = ((584 - 600) / 600) * 100 = (-16 / 600) * 100 = -2.67%",
  "Answer": "-2.67%",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The text mentions that the **value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors** is not included in the consolidated financial statements, but it is directly affected by business volumes and credit risks.
- The decrease in 2008 was due to a **reduction in available receivables**.
- The **carrying value** of the sold receivables approximates fair value, so no gain or loss was recognized.
