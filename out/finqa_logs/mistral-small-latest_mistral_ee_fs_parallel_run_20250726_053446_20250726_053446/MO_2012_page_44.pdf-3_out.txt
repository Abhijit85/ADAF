=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the growth rate in total shipment volume from 2011 to 2012?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify shipment volumes: 2012 = 763.3 million, 2011 = 734.6 million. 2. Calculate difference: 763.3 - 734.6 = 28.7 million. 3. Compute growth rate: (28.7 / 734.6) × 100 ≈ 3.91%.",
  "Answer": "3.91%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2012: 763.3 million
- 2011: 734.6 million
- Difference = 763.3 - 734.6 = 28.7 million
- Growth Rate = (28.7 / 734.6) × 100 ≈ 3.91%
- Difference = 763.3 million - 734.6 million = 28.7 million
- Growth Rate = (28.7 million / 734.6 million) × 100 ≈ 3.91%
