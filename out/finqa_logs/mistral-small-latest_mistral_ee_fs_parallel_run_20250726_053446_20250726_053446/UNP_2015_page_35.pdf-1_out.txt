{
  "Question": "in 2014 what was the ratio of the cash used for investment to the cash from operations",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the two values for 2014:\n   - Cash used in investing activities (2014) = $4249 million\n   - Cash provided by operating activities (2014) = $7385 million\n2. Calculate the ratio:\n   - Ratio = Cash used in investing activities / Cash provided by operating activities\n   - Ratio = $4249 / $7385\n   - Ratio ≈ 0.575",
  "Answer": 0.575,

}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Cash used in investing activities (2014) = $4,249 million
- Cash provided by operating activities (2014) = $7,385 million
- Ratio = Cash used in investing activities / Cash provided by operating activities
- Ratio = $4,249 / $7,385
- Ratio ≈ 0.575
- Cash used in investing activities (2014) = $4,249 million
- Cash provided by operating activities (2014) = $7,385 million
- Ratio = Cash used in investing activities / Cash provided by operating activities
- Ratio = $4,249 / $7,385
- Ratio ≈ 0.575
