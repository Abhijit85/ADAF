=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage change in net fair value of derivatives outstanding at between 2007 and 2008 in thousands?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the net fair value of derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2007: \$25171 (thousands of dollars)\n2. Identify the net fair value of derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2008: \$258800 (thousands of dollars)\n3. Calculate the difference: \$258800 - \$25171 = \$233629\n4. Calculate the percentage change: (233629 / 25171) × 100 ≈ 928.08%",
