=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage change of the net favorable prior period development from 2010 to 2008",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify net favorable prior period development values from text context:\n   - 2010: $503 million\n   - 2008: $814 million\n2. Calculate the difference: $503 million - $814 million = -$311 million\n3. Calculate the percentage change relative to 2008: (-$311 million / $814 million) × 100 ≈ -38.23%",
  "Answer": "-38.23%",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2010: 4.6%
- 2008: 6.8%
- Difference = 4.6% - 6.8% = -2.2%
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2008 Value) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-2.2% / 6.8%) × 100 ≈ -32.35%
- Prior period development (as a percentage) for:
- 2010: 4.6%
- 2008: 6.8%
- 2010: $503 million
- 2008: $814 million
- Difference = $503 million - $814 million = -$311 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2008 Value) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-$311 million / $814 million) × 100 ≈ -38.23%
