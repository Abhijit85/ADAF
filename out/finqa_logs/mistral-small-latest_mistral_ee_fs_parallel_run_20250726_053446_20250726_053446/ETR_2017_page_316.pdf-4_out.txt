=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "how much higher is net revenue in 2017 than 2016 ? ( in millions )",
  "Calculation": "2017 net revenue ($1522.6 million) - 2016 net revenue ($1520.5 million) = $2.1 million",
  "Answer": "2.1 million",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2016 net revenue = $1,520.5 million
- 2017 net revenue = $1,522.6 million
- Difference = 2017 net revenue - 2016 net revenue
- Difference = $1,522.6 million - $1,520.5 million
- Difference = $2.1 million
- None (all necessary data was provided in the table and text context).
- The difference is small ($2.1 million) compared to the total revenue figures, which aligns with the text mentioning "partially offset" changes in various factors (e.g., higher expenses offset by higher other income). This makes the result reasonable.
