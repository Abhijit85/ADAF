✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the value of the rsu's granted",
  "Calculation": "Value of RSUs granted = Number of RSUs granted × Weighted average grant date fair value = 1583616 × $9.32 = 1583616 × (10 - 0.68) = (1583616 × 10) - (1583616 × 0.68) = 15836160 - 1075163.68 = 14761000.32",
  "Answer": "$14761000.32",

```

Answer Echoes:
- Number of RSUs granted = 1,583,616
- Weighted average grant date fair value = $9.32
