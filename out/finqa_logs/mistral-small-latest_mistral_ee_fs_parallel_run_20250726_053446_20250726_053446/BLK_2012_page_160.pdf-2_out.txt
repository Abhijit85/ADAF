✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what percent of the balance increase is attributed to balances assumed in acquisitions?",
  "Calculation": "1. Balance increase = $404M (Dec 31, 2012) - $349M (Jan 1, 2012) = $55M\n2. Positions assumed in acquisitions = $12M\n3. Percentage = ($12M / $55M) * 100 ≈ 21.82%",
  "Answer": "21.82%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Balance at December 31, 2012: $404 million
- Balance at January 1, 2012: $349 million
- Increase = $404 - $349 = $55 million
- Positions assumed in acquisitions (2012): $12 million
- Percentage = (Positions assumed in acquisitions / Total increase) × 100
- Percentage = ($12 / $55) × 100 ≈ 21.82%
- Positions assumed in acquisitions (2012): $12 million
