=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was total net undeveloped acres expiring for the three year period , in thousands?",
  "Calculation": "257 (2016) + 4533 (2017) + 1018 (2018) = 5808",
  "Answer": "5808 (in thousands)",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2016: 257
- 2017: 4,533
- 2018: 1,018
- 257 (2016) + 4,533 (2017) + 1,018 (2018) = 5,808 (in thousands)
- None, as the table provides all necessary data for the calculation.
- The calculation is straightforward and sums the values provided in the table. The result is reasonable given the context of the question.
