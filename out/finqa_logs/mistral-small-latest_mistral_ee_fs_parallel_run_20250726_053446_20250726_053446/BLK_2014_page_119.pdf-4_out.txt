=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what portion of total long-term borrowings is due in the next 36 months?",
  "Calculation": "(($750 + $700) / $4939) × 100 ≈ 29.36%",
  "Answer": "29.36%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The current date is not specified, but assuming the table is from 2015 (since the earliest maturity is 2015), the next 36 months would cover maturities up to 2018.
- Notes maturing within this period:
- 1.375% Notes due 2015: $750
- 6.25% Notes due 2017: $700
- $750 (2015) + $700 (2017) = $1,450
- Total long-term borrowings: $4,950
- Portion due in next 36 months: ($1,450 / $4,950) × 100
- $1,450 / $4,950 ≈ 0.293
- 0.293 × 100 ≈ 29.3%
- The table lists long-term borrowings with maturities, but the exact amounts for 2015, 2017, 2022, and 2024 are derived from the text context.
- **2015 Notes**: $750 million (due June 2015).
- **2017 Notes**: $700 million (due 2017).
- **2022 Notes**: $750 million (due June 2022).
- **2024 Notes**: $1.0 billion (due March 2024).
- $750 (2015) + $700 (2017) = **$1,450 million**.
- Total long-term borrowings (2014): $4,939 million.
- Portion due in next 36 months: ($1,450 / $4,939) × 100.
- $1,450 / $4,939 ≈ 0.2936.
- 0.2936 × 100 ≈ **29.36%**.
