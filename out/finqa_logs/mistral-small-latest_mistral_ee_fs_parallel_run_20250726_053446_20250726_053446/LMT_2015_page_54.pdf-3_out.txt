✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "in 2015 what was the ratio of the net sales to the backlog",
  "Calculation": "Net sales in 2015: $6770 / Backlog at year-end 2015: $15500 = 6770 / 15500 ≈ 0.4368 (rounded to 0.44)",
  "Answer": 0.44,
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Net sales in 2015: $6,770
- Backlog at year-end 2015: $15,500
- Ratio = Net sales / Backlog = $6,770 / $15,500
- $6,770 ÷ $15,500 ≈ 0.4368
- The ratio of 0.44 means that for every dollar of backlog, approximately $0.44 was realized as net sales in 2015. This is reasonable given the context of declining backlog due to multi-year program sales and limited new business awards.
