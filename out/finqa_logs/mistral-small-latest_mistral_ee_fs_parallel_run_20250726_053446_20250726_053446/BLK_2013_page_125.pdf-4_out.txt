✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the growth rate in rent expense and certain office equipment expense in 2012 compare to 2011?",
  "Calculation": "Growth Rate = ((2012 Value - 2011 Value) / 2011 Value) * 100 = (($133 million - $154 million) / $154 million) * 100 = (-$21 million / $154 million) * 100 = -13.636% ≈ -13.64%",
  "Answer": "-13.64%",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2011: $154 million
- 2012: $133 million
- Difference = 2012 value - 2011 value
- Difference = $133 million - $154 million = -$21 million
- Growth Rate = (Difference / 2011 value) * 100
- Growth Rate = (-$21 million / $154 million) * 100
- Growth Rate = -13.636% (rounded to 4 decimal places)
