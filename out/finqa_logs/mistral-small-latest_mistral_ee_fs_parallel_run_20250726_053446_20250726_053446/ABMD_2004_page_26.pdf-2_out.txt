=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "total future minimum lease payments due after 5 years are what percent of the total remaining?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the total future minimum lease payments (Base): $4578000\n2. Identify the lease payments due after 5 years (Part): $708000\n3. Calculate the percentage: (Part / Base) × 100 = (708000 / 4578000) × 100\n4. Perform the division: 708000 / 4578000 ≈ 0.1546\n5. Convert to percentage: 0.1546 × 100 ≈ 15.46%",
  "Answer": "15.46%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- None. The table data and text context provided are sufficient to answer the question.
- The calculation is mathematically correct and the result is reasonable (15.46% is a plausible percentage for long-term lease obligations).
- The units are consistent (both values are in thousands of dollars).
- The text context confirms the lease obligations are non-cancelable and span multiple years, supporting the use of the table data.
