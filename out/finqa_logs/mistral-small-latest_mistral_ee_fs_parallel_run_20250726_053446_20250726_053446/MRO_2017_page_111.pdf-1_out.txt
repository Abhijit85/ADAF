=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "for revisions of previous estimates , what was the impact in mmboe resulting from an increase in drilling programs in u.s . resource plays and an increase in discontinued operations due to technical reevaluation and lower royalty percentages related to lower realized prices?",
  "Calculation": "The table explicitly states the net impact of revisions of previous estimates for 2017 as 5 mmboe. While the text context provides detailed breakdowns for 2015 (which do not align with the 2017 table data), the table's net value takes precedence. Therefore, the answer is derived directly from the table's 2017 data.",
  "Answer": "5 mmboe",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Drilling programs: +105 mmboe
- Discontinued operations: +67 mmboe
- Total positive contributions: 105 + 67 = 172 mmboe
- Capital development reductions: -173 mmboe
- Net impact: 172 - 173 = -1 mmboe
