✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the growth rate of the cash flows from operations from 2011 to 2012",
  "Calculation": "Growth Rate = ((Cash Flow 2012 - Cash Flow 2011) / Cash Flow 2011) * 100 = (($6.8 billion - $6.1 billion) / $6.1 billion) * 100 ≈ 11.48%",
  "Answer": "11.48%",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2011: $6.1 billion
- 2012: $6.8 billion
- Difference = $6.8 billion - $6.1 billion = $0.7 billion
- Growth Rate = (Difference / 2011 Value) * 100
- Growth Rate = ($0.7 billion / $6.1 billion) * 100 ≈ 11.48%
