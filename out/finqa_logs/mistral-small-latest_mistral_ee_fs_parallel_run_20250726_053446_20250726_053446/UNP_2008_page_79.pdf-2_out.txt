=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the difference in billions of sold receivables from 2007 to 2008?",
  "Calculation": "Difference = 2008 value - 2007 value = $584 million - $600 million = -$16 million = -$0.016 billion",
  "Answer": "-$0.016 billion",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2008: $584 million
- 2007: $600 million
- Difference = 2008 value - 2007 value
- Difference = $584 million - $600 million
- Difference = -$16 million
