=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the average payment volume per transaction for jcb?",
  "Calculation": "Average payment volume per transaction = Payments Volume / Total Transactions = 55 / 0.6 = 91.666... (repeating) = 91.67 (rounded to two decimal places)",
  "Answer": "$91.67",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Payments Volume (JCB) = $55 billion
- Total Transactions (JCB) = 0.6 billion
- None, as the table provides all necessary data for this calculation. The text context clarifies that JCB's figures are for April 2006 through March 2007, but this does not affect the calculation.
