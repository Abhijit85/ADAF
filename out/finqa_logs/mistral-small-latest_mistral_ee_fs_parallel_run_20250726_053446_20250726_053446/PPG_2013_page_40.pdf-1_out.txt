=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "does the company spend more on advertising in 2013 than on research and development?",
  "Calculation": "Advertising expense (2013) = $345 million. R&D expense (2013) is not provided in the table or text. Without the R&D expense value, a direct comparison cannot be made.",
  "Answer": "Unable to determine without R&D expense data for 2013.",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The **R&D expenses for 2013** must be provided to complete the comparison.
