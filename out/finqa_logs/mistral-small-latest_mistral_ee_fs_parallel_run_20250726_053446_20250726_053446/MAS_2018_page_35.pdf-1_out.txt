=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the difference in operating profit margins as adjusted between 2016 and 2017?",
  "Calculation": "15.7% (2017) - 15.1% (2016) = 0.6%",
  "Answer": "0.6%",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2016: 15.1%
- 2017: 15.7%
- 15.7% - 15.1% = 0.6%
- 2016: 15.1%
- 2017: 15.7%
- 15.7% (2017) - 15.1% (2016) = 0.6%
