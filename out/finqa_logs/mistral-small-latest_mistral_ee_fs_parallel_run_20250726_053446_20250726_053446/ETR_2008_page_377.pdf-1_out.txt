{
  "Question": "what is the growth rate in net revenue for entergy texas , inc . in 2007?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the net revenue for 2006 and 2007 from the table: 2006 net revenue = $403.3 million, 2007 net revenue = $442.3 million. 2. Calculate the difference in net revenue: Difference = $442.3 million - $403.3 million = $39.0 million. 3. Calculate the growth rate as a percentage of the 2006 net revenue: Growth rate = ($39.0 million / $403.3 million) × 100 ≈ 9.67%.",
  "Answer": "9.67%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2006 net revenue = $403.3 million
- 2007 net revenue = $442.3 million
- Difference = 2007 net revenue - 2006 net revenue
- Difference = $442.3 million - $403.3 million = $39.0 million
- Growth rate = (Difference / 2006 net revenue) × 100
- Growth rate = ($39.0 million / $403.3 million) × 100 ≈ 9.67%
- Difference = 2007 net revenue - 2006 net revenue
- Difference = $442.3 million - $403.3 million = $39.0 million
- Growth rate = (Difference / 2006 net revenue) × 100
- Growth rate = ($39.0 million / $403.3 million) × 100 ≈ 9.67%
