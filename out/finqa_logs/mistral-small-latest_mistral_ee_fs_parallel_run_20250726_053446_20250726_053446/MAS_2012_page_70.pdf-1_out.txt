=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the percentage change in total net goodwill between 2010 and 2011?",
  "Calculation": "1. Identify the total net goodwill for 2010 and 2011 from the table: Net Goodwill at December 31, 2010: $2383 million, Net Goodwill at December 31, 2011: $1891 million. 2. Calculate the difference: $1891 million - $2383 million = -$492 million. 3. Calculate the percentage change: (-$492 million / $2383 million) × 100 ≈ -20.65%.",
  "Answer": "-20.65%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Net Goodwill at December 31, 2010: $2,383
- Net Goodwill at December 31, 2011: $1,891
- Difference = $1,891 - $2,383 = -$492
- Percentage Change = (Difference / 2010 Net Goodwill) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-$492 / $2,383) × 100 ≈ -20.65%
- Difference = Net Goodwill (2011) - Net Goodwill (2010)
- Difference = $1,891 million - $2,383 million = -$492 million
- Percentage Change = (Difference / Net Goodwill (2010)) × 100
- Percentage Change = (-$492 million / $2,383 million) × 100 ≈ -20.65%
