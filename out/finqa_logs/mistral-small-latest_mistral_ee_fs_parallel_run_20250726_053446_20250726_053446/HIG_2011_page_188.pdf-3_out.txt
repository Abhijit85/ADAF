=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what is the change in dac balance resulting from all amortization accounts in 2011?",
  "Calculation": "Sum of amortization-related entries for 2011: $(2920) + $0 + $(507) = $(3427)",
  "Answer": "-$3427",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Amortization — DAC: $(2,920)
- Amortization — DAC from discontinued operations: $0
- Amortization — Unlock benefit (charge), pre-tax: $(507)
