✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what percent of the change between net revenue in 2007 and 2008 was due to rider revenue?",
  "Calculation": "Change in net revenue = 252.7 - 231.0 = 21.7 million. Percentage due to rider revenue = (3.9 / 21.7) × 100 ≈ 18.02%",
  "Answer": "18.02%",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2008 net revenue: $252.7 million
- 2007 net revenue: $231.0 million
- Change in net revenue = $252.7 million - $231.0 million = $21.7 million
- Rider revenue = $3.9 million
- Percentage = (Rider revenue / Change in net revenue) × 100
- Percentage = ($3.9 million / $21.7 million) × 100 ≈ 18.02%
