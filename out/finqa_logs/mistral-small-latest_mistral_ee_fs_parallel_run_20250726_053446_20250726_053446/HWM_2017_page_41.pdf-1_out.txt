=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "Considering the reverse stock split, what was the percentual reduction of the common stock outstanding shares?",
  "Calculation": "The text explicitly states the reverse stock split reduced shares from 1.3 billion to 0.4 billion. The percentual reduction is calculated as: ((1.3 billion - 0.4 billion) / 1.3 billion) * 100 = (0.9 billion / 1.3 billion) * 100 ≈ 69.23%. This aligns with a 1-for-3 split ratio (100% - 33.33% = 66.67%), with slight rounding differences.",
  "Answer": "69.23%",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- **Before Split (2016)**:
- High: $34.50
- Low: $16.75
- **After Split (2017)**:
- High: $30.69
- Low: $18.64
- The reverse stock split ratio can be calculated by comparing the high or low prices before and after the split.
- Using the high prices:
- Split Ratio = (Price Before Split) / (Price After Split) = $34.50 / $30.69 ≈ 1.124
- Using the low prices:
- Split Ratio = $16.75 / $18.64 ≈ 0.899
- The average of these ratios is approximately 1.012, but this is not precise. Instead, we can use the more reliable high price ratio of 1.124.
- A reverse stock split of 1.124 means that for every 1.124 shares before the split, there is now 1 share after the split.
- The reduction in shares is calculated as:
- Reduction = (Split Ratio - 1) × 100 = (1.124 - 1) × 100 ≈ 12.4%
- Alternatively, using the low prices:
- Reduction = (1 - 0.899) × 100 ≈ 10.1%
- The average reduction is approximately 11.25%, but the high price method is more commonly used for such calculations.
- **Calculation**: (34.50 / 30.69 - 1) × 100 ≈ 12.4%
- **Answer**: 12.4%
- The high and low stock prices before and after the split are provided, but the text explicitly states the split ratio (1-for-3) and the exact reduction in shares (from 1.3 billion to 0.4 billion).
- Reduction = (Original Shares - New Shares) / Original Shares × 100
- Reduction = (1.3 billion - 0.4 billion) / 1.3 billion × 100
- Reduction = 0.9 billion / 1.3 billion × 100 ≈ 69.23%
