=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what were net trading assets from derivatives in 2012 , in millions?",
  "Calculation": "Net trading assets from derivatives = Derivative receivables - Derivative payables = $85744 million - $76162 million = $9582 million",
  "Answer": "9582",
  "Source": "table"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Trading assets – derivative receivables (2012) = $85,744 million
- Trading liabilities – derivative payables (2012) = $76,162 million
