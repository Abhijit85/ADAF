=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "what was the change in millions of operating income from 2016 to 2017?",
  "Calculation": "2017 Operating Income ($11503 million) - 2016 Operating Income ($10815 million) = $688 million",
  "Answer": "688 million",
  "Source": "combined"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Change = 2017 Operating Income - 2016 Operating Income
- Change = $11,503 million - $10,815 million
- Change = $688 million
- The text explicitly confirms the change in operating income is $688 million, matching the table calculation.
- The result is reasonable given the context of price increases and cost changes.
