=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "between december 31 , 2011 and december 31 , 2010 , what was the change in the unpaid principal balance outstanding of loans sold as a participant in these programs in billions?",
  "Calculation": "Change = 2011 balance - 2010 balance = $13.0 billion - $13.2 billion = -$0.2 billion",
  "Answer": "-$0.2 billion",
  "Source": "text"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 2011: $13.0 billion
- 2010: $13.2 billion
- Change = 2011 balance - 2010 balance
- Change = $13.0 billion - $13.2 billion
- Change = -$0.2 billion
