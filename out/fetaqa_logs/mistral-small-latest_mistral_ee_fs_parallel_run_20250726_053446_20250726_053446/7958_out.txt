=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "What was Adrian’s final time and what lead did that give him?",
  "Factual Answer": "Nathan Adrian’s final time was 47.52 seconds, giving him a 0.01-second lead over James Magnussen, who finished second with a time of 47.53 seconds.",

```

Answer Echoes:
- The table contains swimming race results with columns for Rank, Lane, Name, Nationality, Time, and Notes.
- Nathan Adrian is listed in the first row with a time of 47.52 seconds.
- The highlighted cells indicate comparisons between swimmers, but no explicit "lead" information is provided.
- Nathan Adrian's final time was **47.52 seconds**.
- The table does not explicitly state the lead time, but since he finished with the fastest time (ranked 1st), he had a lead of **0.01 seconds** over James Magnussen (47.53 seconds).
- The time and ranking data were extracted from the provided table. The lead was calculated by comparing Adrian's time to the next fastest competitor.
---
- The table lists **Nathan Adrian** as the winner.
- His **final time** is explicitly stated as **47.52 seconds**.
- The table does not explicitly mention the lead time, but the ranking and times of other swimmers are provided.
---
- **Rank 1:** Nathan Adrian (USA) – **47.52 seconds**
- **Rank 2:** James Magnussen (Australia) – **47.53 seconds**
- The **lead time** is calculated by comparing Adrian’s time to the next fastest competitor (Magnussen).
- Adrian’s time: **47.52**
- Magnussen’s time: **47.53**
- **Lead = 47.53 – 47.52 = 0.01 seconds**
---
- **Adrian’s final time:** **47.52 seconds**
- **Lead over the next competitor (James Magnussen):** **0.01 seconds**
