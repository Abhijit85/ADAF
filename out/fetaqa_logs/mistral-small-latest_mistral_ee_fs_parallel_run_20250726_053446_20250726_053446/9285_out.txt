=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "What is the total number of floors in Absolute World?",
  "Factual Answer": "The total number of floors in Absolute World is 106, consisting of 56 floors in the South tower and 50 floors in the North tower.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Floors: 56
- Floors: 50
- "Absolute World - South" has 56 floors.
- "Absolute World - North" has 50 floors.
- The total number of floors in the Absolute World complex is the sum of these two numbers: 56 (South) + 50 (North) = 106 floors.
