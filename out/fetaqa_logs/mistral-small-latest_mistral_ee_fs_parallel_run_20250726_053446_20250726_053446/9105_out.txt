✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "When was the first time a plane was equipped for maritime usage in the Cape Verdean Armed Forces?",
  "Factual Answer": "The first plane equipped for maritime usage in the Cape Verdean Armed Forces was the Dornier Do 228, which entered service in 1991.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
---
- The **Dornier Do 228** is explicitly noted for maritime usage.
- The **Casa C-212 MPA** is also a maritime patrol aircraft but entered service later.
---
- Aircraft types with maritime roles.
- Service entry dates.
- Text context (Wikipedia) for aircraft descriptions.
- Structured data (table) for exact dates and roles.
- Compare service entry dates of maritime aircraft.
- Identify the earliest one (Dornier Do 228, 1991).
- No conflicting dates or roles in the provided sources.
