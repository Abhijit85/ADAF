=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "How did the Arsys' Reviver do in terms of game awards in the year 1987?",
  "Factual Answer": "The available sources (text and structured data) do not contain any information about *Reviver: The Real-Time Adventure* winning or being nominated for any game awards in 1987. There is no evidence in the provided data that the game received any formal recognition.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "Low"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The answer is based on the absence of information rather than explicit confirmation.
- Additional historical records or award databases from 1987 would be needed to determine if *Reviver* received any awards.
- Specific award nominations or wins for *Reviver* in 1987.
- Historical records of game awards from 1987 (e.g., from industry publications like *Computer Gaming World* or *Dragon Magazine*).
- Critical reception or retrospective analyses of the game's impact.
