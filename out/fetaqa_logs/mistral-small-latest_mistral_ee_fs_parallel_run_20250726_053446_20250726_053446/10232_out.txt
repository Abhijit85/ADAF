=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "How many ships did UB-43 sink and damage?",
  "Factual Answer": "UB-43 sank 23 ships and damaged 1 ship (HMS Grafton).",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Sunk ships: Counted from the table (rows 1-23, excluding the summary row).
- Damaged ship: "HMS Grafton" (row 22) is the only entry with "Damaged" as the fate. The summary row confirms 1 damaged ship (7,350 tons).
- **Sunk ships**: 23 (counted from individual entries in the table).
- **Damaged ships**: 1 (HMS Grafton, 7,350 tons, on 10 June 1917).
- The summary row in the table aligns with this count: "Sunk: 99,176 tons" (from 23 ships) and "Damaged: 7,350 tons" (from 1 ship).
