=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "What radio frequencies are owned by CJGY-FM, and where are these frequencies located?",
  "Factual Answer": "CJGY-FM operates two radio frequencies: 96.7 FM in Dawson Creek and 97.1 FM in Fort St. John.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- **Dawson Creek**: Frequency is 96.7 FM.
- **Fort St. John**: Frequency is 97.1 FM.
- **Dawson Creek**: Frequency **96.7 FM** (identifier: CJGY-FM-2).
- **Fort St. John**: Frequency **97.1 FM** (identifier: CJGY-FM-1).
- No additional information is needed, as the structured data provides complete details.
- If further verification were required, cross-referencing with official broadcasting databases (e.g., CRTC Canada) would confirm the frequencies.
---
- **96.7 FM** in **Dawson Creek**.
- **97.1 FM** in **Fort St. John**.
