  "Question": "What roles did Simon Nash star in?",

Answer Echoes:
- The provided text context is from a Wikipedia page about **Simon Nash**, specifically the "Television roles" section.
- However, the text does not explicitly list any roles played by Simon Nash.
- The structured data (table) does not mention "Simon Nash" but instead lists "Simon Cashmere" in the role of "Kappatoo/Simon Cashmere" (1990–1992).
- The structured data (table) does not contain any entries for "Simon Nash."
- The closest name is **"Simon Cashmere"**, who appeared in the production **"Kappatoo"** (1990–1992).
- There is no direct evidence linking "Simon Nash" to "Simon Cashmere" in the provided data.
- The available data does **not** confirm any roles played by **Simon Nash**.
- The only relevant entry is for **"Simon Cashmere"**, who starred in **"Kappatoo"** (1990–1992).
- If "Simon Nash" is a variant or alias of "Simon Cashmere," additional context is required to confirm this.
- **Low** (due to lack of direct evidence for "Simon Nash" in the provided sources).
- Clarification on whether "Simon Nash" is an alias or variant of "Simon Cashmere."
- Additional sources confirming roles played by Simon Nash.
