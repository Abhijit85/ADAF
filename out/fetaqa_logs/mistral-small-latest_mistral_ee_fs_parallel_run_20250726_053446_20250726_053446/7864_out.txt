=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "How many Arabs and Jews were injured or killed in the 1929 Palestine riots?",
  "Factual Answer": "In the 1929 Palestine riots, 133 Jews were killed and 198–241 were injured, while at least 116 Arabs were killed (possibly more) and at least 232 were injured (possibly more). The exact numbers for Arab casualties may be incomplete.",

```

Answer Echoes:
- For **Jews**:
- Deaths: 133
- Injuries: 198–241
- For **Arabs**:
- Deaths: 116+ (possibly higher)
- Injuries: 232+ (possibly higher)
- **Jews**: 133 were killed and 198–241 were injured.
- **Arabs**: 116+ (possibly higher) were killed and 232+ (possibly higher) were injured.
- **Jews**:
- **Deaths**: 133
- **Injuries**: 198–241
- **Arabs**:
- **Deaths**: 116+ (possibly higher)
- **Injuries**: 232+ (possibly higher)
- **Jews**:
- **Killed**: 133
- **Injured**: 198–241
- **Arabs**:
