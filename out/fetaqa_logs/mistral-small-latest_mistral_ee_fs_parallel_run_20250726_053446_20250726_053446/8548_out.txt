=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "What are the two most recent projects?",
  "Factual Answer": "The two most recent projects involving twin-fuselage aircraft are: 1. Scaled Composites Model 351 Roc (2019, USA) – A prototype spacecraft launcher for Stratolaunch. 2. Towed Glider Air-Launch Concept (2013, USA) – A NASA Dryden project for spacecraft launch.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- "Towed Glider Air-Launch Concept" (Row 28, Date: 2013, Status: Project).
- "Scaled Composites Model 351 Roc" (Row 29, Date: 2019, Status: Prototype, Notes: Launcher for Stratolaunch spacecraft).
- **Status**: "Project" or "Prototype" (to exclude non-project entries).
- **Date**: Sorted in descending order to identify the most recent entries.
