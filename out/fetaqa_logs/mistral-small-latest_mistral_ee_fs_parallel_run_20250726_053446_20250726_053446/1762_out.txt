=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "Did Davis Tarwater set any individual national records?",
  "Factual Answer": "No, Davis Tarwater did not set any individual national records. The available data and text sources indicate that his achievements include American, U.S. Open, and Big Ten Conference records, but no records explicitly labeled as 'national records' are attributed to him.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Row 2: An American record for the 200 m SC butterfly (1:51.90, set on December 17, 2011).
- Rows 9, 11, and 14: Big Ten Conference records for the 200 yd butterfly (e.g., 1:41.84, set on March 25, 2006).
- Table rows 2, 9, 11, and 14 (highlighted cells).
- Absence of explicit "National records" entries for individual achievements.
- The table includes records labeled as "American," "U.S. Open," and "Big Ten Conference," but not "National records."
- Highlighted cells (rows 2, 9, 11, 14) show achievements in these categories, but none are explicitly labeled as "national records."
- The term "National records" appears in the header but is not tied to any individual achievement in the data.
