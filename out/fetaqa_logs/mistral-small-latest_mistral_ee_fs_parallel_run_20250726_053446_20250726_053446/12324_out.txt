{
  "Question": "How could the location of Des Moines be described in terms of where it is by Pleasant Hill and Iowa 163?",
  "Factual Answer": "Des Moines is located to the west of Pleasant Hill along the Des Moines Bypass. Iowa 163 (E University Avenue) in Pleasant Hill serves as a reference point east of Des Moines, as the exits for Des Moines (e.g., Exit 99 at mile 4.958) occur at lower mile markers compared to those for Pleasant Hill (e.g., Exit 77 at mile 17.905).",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Pleasant Hill is mentioned at mile 17.905 (Exit 77) and mile 20.016 (Exit 79), where Iowa 163 (E University Avenue) is located.
- Des Moines is referenced at multiple points, including Exit 99 (Iowa 28) and Exit 97 (Fleur Drive).
- Des Moines exits (e.g., Exit 99 at mile 4.958) are west of Pleasant Hill exits (e.g., Exit 77 at mile 17.905).
- Iowa 163 (E University Avenue) in Pleasant Hill serves as a reference point east of Des Moines.
