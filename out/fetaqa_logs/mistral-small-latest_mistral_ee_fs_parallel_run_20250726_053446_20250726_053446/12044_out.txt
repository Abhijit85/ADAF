  "Question": "How well did Billy Reynolds perform as a player for Vale in the 222 games he played?",
  "Factual Answer": "Billy Reynolds performed very well for Burslem Port Vale, scoring 104 goals in 222 games (an average of ~0.47 goals per game). His performance was particularly strong in 'Other' competitions (likely friendlies or local cups), where he scored 93 goals in 195 appearances (a rate of ~0.48 goals per game). In contrast, he scored fewer goals in league (4 in 16 apps) and FA Cup (7 in 11 apps) matches. His overall goal-scoring rate suggests he was a prolific scorer, especially in non-league and cup competitions.",
