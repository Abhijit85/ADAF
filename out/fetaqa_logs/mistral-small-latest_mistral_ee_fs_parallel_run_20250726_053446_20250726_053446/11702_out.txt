{
  "Question": "Where were the opening and final matches held in the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup, who were the teams, and what were the scores?",
  "Factual Answer": "The opening match of the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup was held at Waldstadion, Frankfurt, where Germany defeated Australia 4–3. The final match was also held at Waldstadion, Frankfurt, where Brazil defeated Argentina 4–1. The venues for these matches are inferred from the text context, as the structured data does not explicitly confirm them.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "Medium"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- **Opening Match**:
- **Location**: Not explicitly stated in the data (additional context required for the venue).
- **Teams**: Germany vs. Australia.
- **Score**: Germany won 4–3.
- **Final Match**:
- **Location**: Not explicitly stated in the data (additional context required for the venue).
- **Teams**: Brazil vs. Argentina.
- **Score**: Brazil won 4–1.
- The specific venues (cities or stadiums) for the opening and final matches are not provided in the data. Additional information about the host cities or stadiums would be needed to answer the "where" part of the question fully.
- **Opening Match**:
- **Teams**: Germany vs. Australia
- **Score**: Germany won 4–3
- **Final Match**:
- **Teams**: Brazil vs. Argentina
- **Score**: Brazil won 4–1
- **Opening Match**:
- **Location**: **Waldstadion, Frankfurt** (inferred from the text context, as it was a key venue for the tournament).
- **Teams**: Germany vs. Australia
- **Score**: Germany won 4–3
- **Final Match**:
- **Location**: **Waldstadion, Frankfurt** (likely, but not explicitly confirmed in the data).
- **Teams**: Brazil vs. Argentina
- **Score**: Brazil won 4–1
- **Explicit confirmation of the venues** for the opening and final matches (though Waldstadion is a strong candidate based on the text context).
- **Additional sources** (e.g., official FIFA records) would be needed for full verification.
