Answer Echoes:
- In 2013, the song "Jiya Re" from the film *Jab Tak Hai Jaan* was nominated for **Best Female Playback Singer** at the Filmfare Awards.
- The same song was also nominated for **Best Female Playback** at the Screen Awards in 2013.
- Filmfare Awards (2013) and Screen Awards (2013) entries in the table.
- **Song**: "Jiya Re"
- **Film**: *Jab Tak Hai Jaan* (2012)
- **Awards**:
- **Filmfare Awards 2013** – Nominated for **Best Female Playback Singer**
- **Screen Awards 2013** – Nominated for **Best Female Playback**
- **Singer Nominated**: The singer for **"Jiya Re"** was **Neeti Mohan** (as inferred from the Wikipedia page's context, though not explicitly stated in the awards table).
- **Film Featured**: *Jab Tak Hai Jaan* (2012).
- **Reason**: While the text context strongly suggests Neeti Mohan was the singer (as the page is about her), the structured data does not explicitly confirm it. External verification (e.g., checking Filmfare/Screen Awards records) would be needed for **High Confidence**.
- **Explicit confirmation** of the singer's name in the awards table (if available).
- **Official award ceremony records** to verify the nominee.
