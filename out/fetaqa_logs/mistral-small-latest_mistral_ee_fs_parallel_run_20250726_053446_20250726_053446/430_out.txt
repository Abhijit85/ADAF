=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "What happened to the attendance of the Marquette Warriors football team from November 2 to November 9 and why?",
  "Factual Answer": "The attendance for the Marquette Warriors football team decreased from 5953 on November 2 to 4719 on November 9. The decline may be attributed to the November 9 game being scheduled on a Tuesday (a less common day for football) and differences in opponent prominence (Pacific vs. Penn State). The exact cause is not explicitly stated in the available data.",

  "Confidence": "Medium"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- November 2 (Friday): 5,953 attendees
- November 9 (Tuesday): 4,719 attendees
- Exact reasons for the attendance drop (e.g., weather reports, ticket sales data, or fan surveys).
- Opponent prominence impact (e.g., was Penn State a more or less attractive draw?).
- Historical context (e.g., were mid-week games common or unusual for the team?).
