=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "For which role and movie did Adam Wylie win the Young Artist Award for Best Performance by a Young Actor in a Voiceover?",
  "Factual Answer": "Based on the available data, Adam Wylie did not win the Young Artist Award for Best Performance by a Young Actor in a Voiceover for any role. The records only show nominations for *All Dogs Go to Heaven 2* (1996), *The King and I* (1999), and *The Swan Princess* (1994). Further verification from official award sources would be required to confirm any potential wins not listed here.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "Medium"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- *All Dogs Go to Heaven 2* (1996) – "Nominated - Young Artist Award for Best Performance by a Young Actor in a Voiceover."
- *The King and I* (1999) – "Nominated - YoungStar Award for Best Performance in a Voice Over Talent."
- *The Swan Princess* (1994) – "Nominated - Young Artist Award for Best Performance by a Young Actor in a Voiceover."
- **Reasoning**: The sources are consistent in listing nominations but do not confirm a win. However, without external verification (e.g., official award records), we cannot definitively conclude that he never won.
