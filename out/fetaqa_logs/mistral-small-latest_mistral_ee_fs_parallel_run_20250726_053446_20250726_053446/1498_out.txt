=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "How fast was the Earth-grazing meteoroid of October 13th, 1990 moving?",
  "Factual Answer": "The Earth-grazing meteoroid observed on October 13th, 1990, was moving at a speed of 41.74 km/s. This velocity was consistently recorded across all phases of its trajectory (begin, perigee, and end).",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
---
- The text context provides the broader narrative about the event, while the structured data offers precise numerical details.
- The velocity value is consistent across all phases, reinforcing the accuracy of the answer.
- No additional information is needed to answer the question.
