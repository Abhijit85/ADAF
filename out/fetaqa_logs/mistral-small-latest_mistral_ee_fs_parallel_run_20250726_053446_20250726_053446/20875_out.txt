{
  "Question": "Why was Ted Bank fired after leading Idaho to a combined 10-6-2 record in 1937 and 1938?",
  "Factual Answer": "The available sources do not provide a definitive reason for Ted Bank's firing after leading Idaho to a combined 10-6-2 record in 1937 and 1938. While the data confirms Idaho's football records during his tenure, it lacks details about personnel decisions or the context behind his dismissal. Possible reasons could include performance issues beyond win-loss records, external factors like budget cuts or university policies, or controversies not documented in the provided sources. Further research is required to determine the specific reasons for his firing.",

  "Confidence": "Low"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The provided text context (Wikipedia page on Ted Bank) does not explicitly mention the reason for his firing.
- It only includes his coaching record (10-6-2 in 1937-38) but lacks details about personnel decisions or controversies.
- The structured data confirms Idaho’s football records (4–3–1 in 1937, 6–3–1 in 1938), totaling 10–6–2.
- However, it does not provide any insight into why he was dismissed despite a winning record.
- Historical newspaper articles or university records from the 1930s.
- Interviews or biographies of Ted Bank or his contemporaries.
- Official statements from Idaho University regarding his dismissal.
