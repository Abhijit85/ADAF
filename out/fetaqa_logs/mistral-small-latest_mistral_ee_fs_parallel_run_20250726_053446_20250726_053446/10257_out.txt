Answer Echoes:
- The table provides yearly data for a sports team (likely the Gold Coast Suns in the AFL) from 2011 to 2018.
- **Membership Peaks**: The highest membership count is in 2014 with 13,478 members.
- **Position Peaks**: The best finishing position is 12th in 2014.
- Membership data: Column "Members" (2014: 13,478).
- Position data: Column "Finishing position" (2014: 12th).
- **Membership Peak**: 2014 (13,478 members)
- **Position Peak**: 2014 (12th place)
---
- **Text Context**: Confirms the relevance of membership and position data.
- **Structured Data**: Provides exact numbers and years for the peaks.
- **Consistency**: Both sources align perfectly, ensuring accuracy.
