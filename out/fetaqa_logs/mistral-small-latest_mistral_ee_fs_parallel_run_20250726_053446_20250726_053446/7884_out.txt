=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "What were the work of Infernus between 1998-2000 for Gorgoroth?",
  "Factual Answer": "Between 1998 and 2000, Infernus, as a member of Gorgoroth, was involved in the following releases: 'Destroyer' (1998) and 'Incipit Satan' (2000). His exact contributions (e.g., songwriting, performance, production) are not specified in the provided sources.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "Medium"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- 1998: "Destroyer" by Gorgoroth
- 2000: "Incipit Satan" by Gorgoroth
- Confirmation that Infernus was indeed involved in these specific works (the table does not explicitly state his involvement, but it is inferred based on his association with Gorgoroth during this period).
- Clarification on whether "work" refers to releases, compositions, or other contributions (e.g., production, lyrics). The table only lists titles and years.
- **High** for the fact that these albums were released by Gorgoroth during his tenure.
- **Medium** due to the lack of explicit confirmation of his role in the structured data.
- Confirmation of Infernus's specific contributions (e.g., composition, lyrics, production) to these albums.
- Additional context on whether "work" refers to releases, compositions, or other roles.
