=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "Where does WDNO broadcast and on what frequencies?",
  "Factual Answer": "The provided data does not contain information about the broadcast location or frequencies of WDNO. Further research is required to determine its exact details.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "Low"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The provided text context (from Wikipedia) mentions **WDNO** under the section "Translator stations," but the structured data table lists only **W250CF** and **W256DX** (with frequencies 97.9 FM and 99.1 FM, respectively) in Puerto Rico.
- The call sign **WDNO** is **not explicitly listed** in the structured data, suggesting it may not be a primary station or may operate in a different region.
- The structured data confirms that **WDNO is not among the listed Puerto Rican radio stations** (W250CF and W256DX).
- No frequency or broadcast location is provided for **WDNO** in the given sources.
- **WDNO is not listed in the provided structured data** for Puerto Rico, meaning its broadcast location and frequency are **not available** in this source.
- If **WDNO** is a translator station (as hinted in the text), it may relay a primary station’s signal, but the exact details (frequency, city) are missing.
- **Low** (due to missing data in the provided sources).
- The **call sign, frequency, and broadcast location** of **WDNO** are required to answer the question accurately.
- Additional sources (e.g., FCC database, radio station directories) would be needed to confirm its details.
