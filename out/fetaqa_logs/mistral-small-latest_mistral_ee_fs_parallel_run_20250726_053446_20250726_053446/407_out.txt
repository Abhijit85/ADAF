=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "How much does the six-digit model cost compared to the twelve-digit model?",
  "Factual Answer": "The six-digit model (1206) costs $49.95 (kit) or $59.95 (assembled), while the twelve-digit model (1212) costs $89.95 (kit) or $99.95 (assembled). The twelve-digit model is significantly more expensive, with a price difference of $40.00 in both kit and assembled forms.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The **six-digit model (1206)** has a kit price of **$49.95** and an assembled price of **$59.95**.
- The **twelve-digit model (1212)** has a kit price of **$89.95** and an assembled price of **$99.95**.
- Six-digit model (1206): Kit price = $49.95, Assembled price = $59.95
- Twelve-digit model (1212): Kit price = $89.95, Assembled price = $99.95
- **Six-digit model (1206)**: Kit price = $49.95, Assembled price = $59.95
- **Twelve-digit model (1212)**: Kit price = $89.95, Assembled price = $99.95
