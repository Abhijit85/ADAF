=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "For how much gross register tons (GRT) did the German submarine U-409 sink and/or damaged?",
  "Factual Answer": "The provided data does not confirm the total GRT of ships sunk or damaged by U-409. If the question refers to the ships listed in the table (without submarine attribution), the total GRT is 32490 GRT. However, this cannot be definitively linked to U-409 without additional evidence.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "Low"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- **Bullmouth**: 7,519 GRT (Damaged)
- **Silverwillow**: 6,373 GRT (Sunk)
- **Malantic**: 3,837 GRT (Sunk)
- **Rosewood**: 5,989 GRT (Sunk)
- **City of Venice**: 8,762 GRT (Sunk)
- **HMS LCE-14**: 10 GRT (Sunk, transported on board City of Venice)
- **Damaged**: Bullmouth (7,519 GRT)
- **Sunk**: Silverwillow (6,373 GRT), Malantic (3,837 GRT), Rosewood (5,989 GRT), City of Venice (8,762 GRT), HMS LCE-14 (10 GRT)
- **Dates** (not directly relevant to the question)
- **Nationalities** (not directly relevant)
- **Tonnage (GRT)**
- **Fate (sunk/damaged)**
- **Bullmouth**: 7,519 GRT (Damaged)
- **Silverwillow**: 6,373 GRT (Sunk)
- **Malantic**: 3,837 GRT (Sunk)
- **Rosewood**: 5,989 GRT (Sunk)
- **City of Venice**: 8,762 GRT (Sunk)
- **HMS LCE-14**: 10 GRT (Sunk, transported on board *City of Venice*)
- **Damaged**: 7,519 GRT
- **Sunk**: 6,373 + 3,837 + 5,989 + 8,762 + 10 = 24,971 GRT
- **Total**: 7,519 + 24,971 = **32,490 GRT**
- **Explicit confirmation** that U-409 sank/damaged these ships.
- **Alternative sources** (e.g., U-409’s war patrol reports) to verify sinkings.
- A source explicitly linking U-409 to these sinkings/damages.
- U-409’s war patrol records or historical accounts confirming its attacks.
