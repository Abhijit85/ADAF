=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "When did SR-71 (band) release the singles \"Right Now\", \"Tomorrow\" and \"1985\" from the album Here We Go Again?",
  "Factual Answer": "The singles were released as follows: \"Right Now\" in 2000 (from *Now You See Inside*), \"Tomorrow\" in 2002 (from *Tomorrow*), and \"1985\" in 2004 (from *Here We Go Again*). Only \"1985\" is from the album *Here We Go Again*.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "Medium"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- "Right Now" (2000) from the album *Now You See Inside*
- "Tomorrow" (2002) from the album *Tomorrow*
- "1985" (2004) from the album *Here We Go Again*
- "Right Now" was released in **2000**.
- "Tomorrow" was released in **2002**.
- "1985" was released in **2004** (from the album *Here We Go Again*).
- **"Right Now"** (2000) – from *Now You See Inside*
- **"Tomorrow"** (2002) – from *Tomorrow*
- **"1985"** (2004) – from *Here We Go Again*
- **"Right Now"** was released in **2000** (but is from *Now You See Inside*, not *Here We Go Again*).
- **"Tomorrow"** was released in **2002** (from *Tomorrow*, not *Here We Go Again*).
- **"1985"** was released in **2004** (from *Here We Go Again*).
- The answer is accurate for the release years, but the question's phrasing may imply a misinterpretation (assuming all three singles are from *Here We Go Again*).
- Clarification on whether the question is asking for all three singles' release years (regardless of album) or only those from *Here We Go Again*.
- **"Right Now"** (2000) – from *Now You See Inside*
- **"Tomorrow"** (2002) – from *Tomorrow*
- **"1985"** (2004) – from *Here We Go Again*
