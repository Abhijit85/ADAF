{
  "Question": "Who is Aaron Schwartz and which movies did he play in from 1990-1999?",
  "Factual Answer": "The provided data does not contain information about Aaron Schwartz or his film roles from 1990-1999. The text context identifies him as an American actor, but no additional details (e.g., birth year, notable works) are included. The structured data table lists film roles for an unnamed actor, with no entries matching Aaron Schwartz. Additional sources are required to confirm his identity and filmography.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "Low"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The provided text context is from a Wikipedia page titled *"Aaron Schwartz (American actor)"* under the "Filmography" section.
- The text does **not** explicitly state who Aaron Schwartz is (e.g., his background, birth year, or notable roles).
- The structured data (table) lists film roles for an unnamed actor, but **none of the entries mention "Aaron Schwartz."**
- The structured data (filmography table) includes:
- **Years**: 1992–2018 (with one "TBA" entry).
- **Roles**: Various unnamed roles (no actor names provided).
- **No mention of "Aaron Schwartz"** in any entry.
- The table does not confirm or deny Aaron Schwartz's involvement in films from 1990–1999.
- **Who is Aaron Schwartz?**
- The provided text does not define Aaron Schwartz beyond being an "American actor."
- Additional sources (e.g., other Wikipedia sections, IMDb) would be needed to confirm his identity, birth year, or notable works.
- **Movies from 1990–1999?**
- The structured data does **not** list any films featuring Aaron Schwartz.
- The table includes films from 1992 onward, but none are attributed to him.
- **Low** (due to missing key details in the provided data).
- **Biographical details** (birth year, career highlights, notable roles).
- **Filmography verification** (confirmed movies featuring Aaron Schwartz).
- **Clarification on whether the table refers to Aaron Schwartz or another actor.**
