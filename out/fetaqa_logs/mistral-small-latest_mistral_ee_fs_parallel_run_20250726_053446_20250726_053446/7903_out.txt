=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "What date and which ships were sunk by U-185?",
  "Factual Answer": "U-185 sank the following ships on these dates: 7 July 1943: James Robertson, Thomas Sinnickson, William Boyce Thompson; 6 August 1943: Fort Halkett.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "Medium"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- **7 July 1943**: James Robertson, Thomas Sinnickson, William Boyce Thompson
- **6 August 1943**: Fort Halkett
- **7 July 1943**: Three ships were sunk:
- *James Robertson*
- *Thomas Sinnickson*
- *William Boyce Thompson*
- **6 August 1943**: One ship was sunk:
- *Fort Halkett*
- **7 July 1943**:
- *James Robertson*
- *Thomas Sinnickson*
- *William Boyce Thompson*
- **6 August 1943**:
- *Fort Halkett*
- **Medium** (The table suggests these sinkings are by U-185, but the text does not explicitly confirm. Additional verification from another source would increase confidence.)
- **Explicit confirmation** that U-185 was responsible for these sinkings (rather than another U-boat).
- **Additional details** (e.g., tonnage, nationality, fate of the ships) if required.
- **7 July 1943**: *James Robertson*, *Thomas Sinnickson*, *William Boyce Thompson*
- **6 August 1943**: *Fort Halkett*
