=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "What was Cicero doing in the Film 'The Princess and the Frog'?",
  "Factual Answer": "There is no character named 'Cicero' in *The Princess and the Frog* (2009). The film does not feature such a character. Roger Cicero, the actor, voiced 'Prince Naveen' in the German version of the film, but this is unrelated to the question.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The provided text context (Roger Cicero's filmography) does not mention any character named "Cicero" in *The Princess and the Frog* (2009).
- The filmography lists Roger Cicero's role as "Prince Naveen" in the German version of the film, but there is no reference to a character named "Cicero."
- The structured data (table) confirms that Roger Cicero voiced "Prince Naveen" in the German dub of *The Princess and the Frog*.
- There is no mention of a character named "Cicero" in the film.
- The film *The Princess and the Frog* (2009) does not feature a character named "Cicero."
- Roger Cicero, the actor, voiced "Prince Naveen" in the German version of the film, but there is no evidence of a character named "Cicero" in the original or dubbed versions.
- **High** (The data and text context consistently confirm the absence of a character named "Cicero" in the film.)
- If the question refers to a different context (e.g., a real-life person named Cicero appearing in the film), additional sources would be needed.
