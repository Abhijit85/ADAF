=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "What happened when Rolla's trade became Liverpool-Brazils?",
  "Factual Answer": "In 1818, the *Rolla* began operating on the Liverpool-Brazils trade route under the master Cowley and owner Hancock. This marked the establishment of this new trade route, which continued until at least 1824. The change likely reflected a strategic shift in the ship's commercial activities.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The trade route "Liverpool-Brazils" was first recorded in **1818**.
- This route was consistently maintained from **1818 to 1824**.
- The master during this period was **"Cowley"**, and the owner was **"Hancock"**.
- No prior records show this trade route before 1818, indicating that this was a new route for the *Rolla* at that time.
