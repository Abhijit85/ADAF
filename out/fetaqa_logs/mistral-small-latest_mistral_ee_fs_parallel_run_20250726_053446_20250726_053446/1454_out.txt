=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "Which engine models improved performance from 1997 to 1998?",
  "Factual Answer": "The GT model was the only Ford Mustang engine variant that improved performance from 1997 to 1998, with an increase in horsepower (215 hp → 225 hp) and torque (285 ft·lbf → 290 ft·lbf). The Base and Cobra models showed no changes, and the Special Edition lacks comparable data.",

Answer Echoes:
- **Base Model**:
- 1997: 150 hp (108 kW) @ 4000 rpm, 215 ft·lbf (291 N·m) of torque @ 2500 rpm
- 1998: 150 hp (108 kW) @ 4000 rpm, 215 ft·lbf (291 N·m) of torque @ 2500 rpm
- **No change** in performance.
- **GT Model**:
- 1997: 215 hp (160 kW) @ 4400 rpm, 285 ft·lbf (386 N·m) of torque @ 3500 rpm
- 1998: 225 hp (168 kW) @ 4750 rpm, 290 ft·lbf (393 N·m) of torque @ 3500 rpm
- **Improvement**: Horsepower increased by 10 hp, and torque increased by 5 ft·lbf.
- **Cobra Model**:
- 1997: 305 hp (227 kW) @ 5800 rpm, 300 ft·lbf (406 N·m) of torque @ 4800 rpm
- 1998: 305 hp (227 kW) @ 5800 rpm, 300 ft·lbf (406 N·m) of torque @ 4800 rpm
- **No change** in performance.
- **Special Edition**:
- No data for 1997 or 1998 (all entries are "-").
- **Base Model**: No change (150 hp, 215 ft·lbf).
- **GT Model**: Improved (215 hp → 225 hp, 285 ft·lbf → 290 ft·lbf).
- **Cobra Model**: No change (305 hp, 300 ft·lbf).
- **Special Edition**: No data available.
- **Horsepower increase**: 215 hp → 225 hp (+10 hp).
- **Torque increase**: 285 ft·lbf → 290 ft·lbf (+5 ft·lbf).
- The answer is fully supported by the structured data analysis, which directly compares performance metrics between the two years.
- No conflicting information exists in the provided sources.
- No additional details are required, as the structured data fully addresses the question.
