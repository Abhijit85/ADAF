=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "How do the Super Bowl VII teams compare in terms of first downs and total net yards?",
  "Factual Answer": "In Super Bowl VII, the Washington Redskins achieved more first downs (16) compared to the Miami Dolphins (12). However, the Dolphins had a higher total net yards (253) than the Redskins (228). This indicates that while the Redskins were more effective in sustaining drives (more first downs), the Dolphins were more efficient in gaining total yardage.",
