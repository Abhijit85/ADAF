- The text context alone does not provide the answer, but the structured data table is sufficient.
- The player's name in the text (Marco Motta) may be a typo or misattribution, as the structured data likely refers to Thiago Motta (a known Roma player during that period). However, the question and answer focus on the factual data provided, not the player's identity.
