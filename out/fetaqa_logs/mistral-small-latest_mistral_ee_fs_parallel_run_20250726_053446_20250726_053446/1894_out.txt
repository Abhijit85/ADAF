- The text context provides historical election data for the Blaenau Gwent constituency, including the 2010 election where **Nick Smith (Labour Party)** was elected.
- The table highlights the 2006 by-election (Dai Davies, Blaenau Gwent People's Voice) but does not extend beyond 2010.
- No updates or post-2010 election results are mentioned.
- The structured data confirms that **Nick Smith (Labour)** was the last recorded MP in 2010.
- No additional representatives or election results are listed beyond this date.
- Election results from **2015, 2017, 2019, and 2024** (if applicable) are needed to determine the current representative.
- Official sources (e.g., UK Parliament website) would provide the latest MP for Blaenau Gwent.
