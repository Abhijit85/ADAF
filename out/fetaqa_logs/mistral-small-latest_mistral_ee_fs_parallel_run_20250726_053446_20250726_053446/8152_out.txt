{
  "Question": "Which films was Madhuurima first seen in 2014?",
  "Factual Answer": "Based on the available data, Madhuurima did not appear in any films in 2014. The provided sources do not list her in any 2014 filmography entries. The name 'Madhuurima' is not present in the structured data, and the closest related role ('Madhu') is associated with the 2010 film 'Orange.' Further verification or additional data may be required to confirm her appearances in that year.",
