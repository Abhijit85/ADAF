{
  "Question": "How many Auris Hybrids did Toyota sell in Europe in 2010 and 2011?",
  "Factual Answer": "In 2010, Toyota sold 15237 hybrid vehicles in Europe, and in 2011, they sold 32725 hybrid vehicles. Since the Auris Hybrid was part of Toyota's hybrid lineup in Europe during these years, these figures likely include Auris Hybrid sales. However, the exact number of Auris Hybrids sold is not explicitly stated in the available data.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "Medium"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- **2010**: "15,237 hybrid" sold in Europe.
- **2011**: "32,725 hybrid" sold in Europe.
- 2010: "15,237 hybrid" (Europe, 2010)
- 2011: "32,725 hybrid" (Europe, 2011)
- The Wikipedia page for the **Toyota Auris** includes a section on **sales**, but the provided text context does not explicitly state the exact sales figures for the **Auris Hybrid** in Europe for 2010 and 2011.
- The structured data table (from the Wikipedia source) provides **hybrid vehicle sales in Europe** for those years, but it does not break down sales by specific models (e.g., Auris Hybrid vs. Prius Hybrid).
- **2010**: Toyota sold **15,237 hybrid vehicles** in Europe.
- **2011**: Toyota sold **32,725 hybrid vehicles** in Europe.
- The **Auris Hybrid** was part of Toyota’s hybrid lineup in Europe during these years, but the table does not specify how many of these sales were specifically for the Auris Hybrid.
- The structured data indicates that **Toyota sold 15,237 hybrid vehicles in Europe in 2010 and 32,725 in 2011**.
- Since the **Auris Hybrid** was part of Toyota’s hybrid lineup in Europe during these years, these figures **likely include Auris Hybrid sales**, but the exact number is not explicitly stated.
- Therefore, the **total hybrid sales figures (15,237 in 2010 and 32,725 in 2011) are the best available estimates for Auris Hybrid sales in Europe for those years**, assuming it was a significant contributor to Toyota’s hybrid sales in the region.
- **Medium** (due to lack of explicit breakdown of Auris Hybrid sales in the structured data).
- The exact sales figures for the **Auris Hybrid alone** (as opposed to all hybrid models) are not provided in the available data.
- Additional sources (e.g., Toyota’s official sales reports or detailed market breakdowns) would be needed to confirm the precise number of Auris Hybrids sold in Europe in 2010 and 2011.
