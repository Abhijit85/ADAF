=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "What team did Roy W. Johnson coach for, how long did he coach for them, and what was his overall record with the team?",
  "Factual Answer": "Roy W. Johnson coached the New Mexico Lobos from 1919–1931 (as an independent team) and 1933–1940 (as part of the Border Conference). His overall record with the team was 165–146 wins and 146 losses.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The table lists the seasons and records for the New Mexico Lobos during the specified periods.
- The aggregated record (165–146) is explicitly stated in the table under "New Mexico:" and "Total:".
- The text context confirms that Roy W. Johnson coached the **New Mexico Lobos**.
- The coaching tenure is split into two periods:
- **1919–1931** (as an independent team)
- **1933–1940** (as part of the Border Conference).
- The text does not explicitly state the overall record but implies it can be derived from the structured data.
- The structured data (table) provides the **exact win-loss record** for Johnson’s tenure:
- **Total record: 165–146** (wins–losses).
- The table confirms the coaching years (1919–1931 and 1933–1940) align with the text.
