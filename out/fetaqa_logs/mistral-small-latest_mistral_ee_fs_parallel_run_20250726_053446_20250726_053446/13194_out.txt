{
  "Question": "What were Angus & Julia Stone's success at the ARIA Music Awards in 2010?",
  "Factual Answer": "The available data and text sources do not provide specific information about Angus & Julia Stone's success at the ARIA Music Awards in 2010. The structured data includes chart positions and certifications but does not mention any nominations, wins, or recognitions from the ARIA Music Awards for that year. Further research from authoritative sources, such as ARIA's official records or award archives, would be required to confirm their success at the 2010 ARIA Music Awards.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "Low"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Chart positions (e.g., ARIA, UK, US)
- Certifications (e.g., Gold, Platinum)
- Release years
- Associated albums
- **Reason**: The sources do not provide direct evidence of ARIA Music Awards success in 2010.
