=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "What is the first major geological structure visible when approaching the mountains via Lamar Alexander Parkway (U.S. 321) and which county is the structure in?",
  "Factual Answer": "The first major geological structure visible when approaching the mountains via Lamar Alexander Parkway (U.S. 321) is the Great Smoky Mountains, located in Sevier County, Tennessee.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- **Blount County**: The location "Walland" is highlighted, where US 321 (Lamar Alexander Parkway) intersects with another route.
- **Sevier County**: The location "Wears Valley" is highlighted, marking the northern terminus of the western segment of the route.
- The table indicates that US 321 (Lamar Alexander Parkway) runs through Blount and Sevier counties, with destinations including Pigeon Forge and Great Smoky Mountains National Park.
- The highlighted cells confirm the route's path through these counties, which are known for their mountainous terrain.
---
---
- **Blount County**: The intersection at Walland (US 321 meets another route).
- **Sevier County**: The northern terminus of the western segment is near Wears Valley.
- The route leads toward **Great Smoky Mountains National Park**, which is in Sevier County.
