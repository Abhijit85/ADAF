=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "How long did the Labour Party hold the Cannock Chase seat and how was it ended?",
  "Factual Answer": "The Labour Party held the Cannock Chase seat for at least one term (1997–2001). The seat was lost by 2010, likely in the 2005 general election, when the Conservatives won. The exact mechanism of the loss (election defeat, boundary changes, etc.) is not specified in the provided data.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "Medium"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The exact end date of Labour's tenure (e.g., dissolution date or next election year).
- The reason for the loss (e.g., election defeat, boundary changes, or other factors).
- The text confirms that **Dr. Tony Wright (Labour)** was the MP for Cannock Chase in **1997**.
- No further Labour MPs are listed for subsequent elections (2010, 2015), implying Labour lost the seat by **2010** (when the Conservatives won).
- The exact end date of Labour’s tenure is not specified in the text.
- **1997**: Labour (Tony Wright) won.
- **2010 & 2015**: Conservative victories (no Labour MP listed).
- The data suggests Labour lost the seat **by 2010**, but the exact mechanism (e.g., election defeat, boundary changes) is not provided.
- **Duration**: The Labour Party held the Cannock Chase seat for **at least one term (1997–2001)**.
- **End of Tenure**: Labour lost the seat **by 2010** (likely in the **2005 general election**, though the exact year is not confirmed in the given data). The loss was due to an **election defeat** (Conservatives won in 2010 and 2015).
- The exact end year (2001 vs. 2005) is unclear, but the loss by 2010 is confirmed.
- Additional data (e.g., 2005 election results) would improve confidence.
- The **exact year Labour lost the seat** (2001 or 2005).
- Whether the loss was due to **election defeat, boundary changes, or other factors**.
