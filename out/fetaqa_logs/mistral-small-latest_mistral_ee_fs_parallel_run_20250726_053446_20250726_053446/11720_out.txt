=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "What aircraft entered the regular service Aerflot in 1962?",
  "Factual Answer": "The Antonov An-24 entered regular service with Aeroflot in 1962.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The text context refers to Aeroflot's retired aircraft, specifically mentioning the **Antonov An-24** and **Tupolev Tu-124** as aircraft introduced in 1962.
- The **Antonov An-24** was a widely used turboprop aircraft in Aeroflot's fleet, making it a strong candidate for regular service.
- The **Tupolev Tu-124** was also introduced in 1962 but was a smaller, less prominent aircraft compared to the An-24.
- The structured data confirms that both the **Antonov An-24** and **Tupolev Tu-124** were introduced in **1962**.
- The **Antonov An-24** is more likely to have been in **regular service** due to its broader operational role in Aeroflot’s fleet.
- No additional details are required, as the sources provide sufficient confirmation.
