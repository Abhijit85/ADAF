=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "What's the destructive power of the 458 Winchester Magnum?",
  "Factual Answer": "The destructive power (muzzle energy) of the .458 Winchester Magnum ranges from 4221 ft⋅lbf (5723 J) to 5570 ft⋅lbf (7550 J), with an average of approximately 4800 ft⋅lbf (6500 J). This makes it one of the most powerful rifle cartridges for big-game hunting.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- **Minimum**: 4,221 ft⋅lbf (5,723 J) (Federal P458T3)
- **Maximum**: 5,570 ft⋅lbf (7,550 J) (Winchester S458WSLSP and S458WSLS)
- **Average**: ~4,800 ft⋅lbf (6,500 J)
- No additional details are needed, as the structured data provides a complete range of muzzle energy values.
