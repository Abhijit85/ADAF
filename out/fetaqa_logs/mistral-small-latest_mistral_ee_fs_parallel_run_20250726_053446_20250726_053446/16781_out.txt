{
  "Question": "How was George Poyser's performance during his participation in the Brentford Club?",
  "Factual Answer": "George Poyser was a consistent presence for Brentford, making 157 total appearances (149 in the league and 8 in the FA Cup) across multiple seasons (1934–35 to 1938–39 and 1945–46). However, he did not score any goals during his time at the club. His performance suggests a non-attacking role, likely as a defender or midfielder, where his contributions were measured in appearances rather than goals.",
