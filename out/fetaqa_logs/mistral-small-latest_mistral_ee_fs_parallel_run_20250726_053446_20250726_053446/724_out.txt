=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "What is enhanced in DOS 3.31?",
  "Factual Answer": "In DOS 3.31, the Absolute disk read (25h) and Absolute disk write (26h) interrupt vectors were enhanced to support partitions up to 2 GB in size.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- **25h (Absolute disk read)**: Enhanced in DOS 3.31 to support up to 2 GB partitions.
- **26h (Absolute disk write)**: Enhanced in DOS 3.31 to support up to 2 GB partitions.
- Table entries for interrupt vectors 25h and 26h, which mention the enhancement in DOS 3.31.
- **Interrupt 25h (Absolute disk read)** and **Interrupt 26h (Absolute disk write)** were enhanced in DOS 3.31.
- The enhancement allows support for **up to 2 GB partitions**.
- **25h (Absolute disk read)**: Enhanced in DOS 3.31 to support up to 2 GB partitions.
- **26h (Absolute disk write)**: Enhanced in DOS 3.31 to support up to 2 GB partitions.
