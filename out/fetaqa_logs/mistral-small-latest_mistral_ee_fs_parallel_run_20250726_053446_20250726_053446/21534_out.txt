}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Manuel Lazo, Cuba, received **12.5 inches (320 mm)** of rainfall.
- The region with the maximum rainfall is **Hampton, Virginia**, which received **18.00 inches (457 mm)**.
- Rainfall data for Manuel Lazo: Row 4 (12.5 inches / 320 mm).
- Maximum rainfall data: Row 14 (18.00 inches / 457 mm).
- **Manuel Lazo, Cuba**: 12.5 inches (320 mm)
- **Hampton, Virginia (maximum rainfall)**: 18.00 inches (457 mm)
- The answer is directly supported by the structured data table.
- The text context does not contradict the data.
- No additional information is needed; the structured data fully answers the question.
