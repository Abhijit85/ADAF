=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "At the end of the 2006-07 season, what were Brashear's PIMs and point total increase from the previous season?",
  "Factual Answer": "At the end of the 2006-07 season, Donald Brashear's penalty minutes (PIMs) decreased by 10 compared to the 2005-06 season, and his point total increased by 4.",
  "Source": "data",
  "Confidence": "High"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- PIMs: 166
- Points: 9 (4 goals + 5 assists)
- PIMs: 156
- Points: 13 (4 goals + 9 assists)
- **PIMs Increase**: 156 (2006-07) - 166 (2005-06) = -10 (decrease of 10 PIMs)
- **Point Total Increase**: 13 (2006-07) - 9 (2005-06) = +4 points
- 2005-06 season data: Row 25 of the table.
- 2006-07 season data: Row 26 of the table.
- **2005-06 Season (Philadelphia Flyers)**:
- PIMs: 166
- Points: 9 (4 goals + 5 assists)
- **2006-07 Season (Washington Capitals)**:
- PIMs: 156
- Points: 13 (4 goals + 9 assists)
- **Calculations**:
- PIMs decrease: 156 - 166 = -10 (decrease of 10 PIMs)
- Point total increase: 13 - 9 = +4 points
