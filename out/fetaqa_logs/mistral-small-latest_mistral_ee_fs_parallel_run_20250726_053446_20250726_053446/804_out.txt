=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "Did SX17 approach the Moon or Earth closer in 2017?",
  "Factual Answer": "SX17 approached Earth closer in 2017 than the Moon. On 2 October 2017, it was 87100 km from Earth, compared to 259900 km from the Moon on 1 October 2017.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Table data showing distances to the Moon and Earth in 2017.
- The exact wording of the text context (e.g., additional details about the approach or significance).
- Whether there were other close approaches to other celestial bodies in 2017 (though the question focuses on Earth vs. Moon).
