=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "In domestic head-to-head matches in New Firm (Scotland) how many games have the teams played with each other and how many wins did each have?",
  "Factual Answer": "The available sources (text and structured data) do not contain information about the number of head-to-head matches played between Aberdeen and Dundee United in the 'New Firm' rivalry or the win counts for each team in these matches. Additional data from official match records is needed to answer this question accurately.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "Low"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The provided text context (Wikipedia page on "New Firm (Scotland)") does not explicitly mention head-to-head match statistics between Aberdeen and Dundee United.
- The term "New Firm" refers to the rivalry between these two teams, but the text does not provide detailed match records.
- The structured data table lists league and cup wins for Aberdeen and Dundee United but does not include head-to-head match records.
- No specific numbers for wins, losses, or total matches between the two teams are present.
- The answer is based on the absence of relevant data in the provided sources.
