✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "On which digital channels does KJZZ-TV host its alternative programming and what's the name of the programming, respectively?",
  "Factual Answer": "KJZZ-TV hosts its alternative programming on digital channels 14.2 (Comet) and 14.3 (TBD).",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Channel 14.2 (Comet) and Channel 14.3 (TBD) are alternative programming channels hosted by KJZZ-TV.
- The programming names for these channels are "Comet" and "TBD," respectively.
- **Channel 14.2**: Hosts programming named **"Comet"** (a digital subchannel).
- **Channel 14.3**: Hosts programming named **"TBD"** (another digital subchannel).
- **Digital Channel 14.2 (Comet)**
- **Digital Channel 14.3 (TBD)**
