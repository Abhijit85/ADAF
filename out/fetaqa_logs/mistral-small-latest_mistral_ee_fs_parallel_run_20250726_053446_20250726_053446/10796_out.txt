=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "What is the literate population compared to the total population of Dongargaon?",
  "Factual Answer": "The literate population of Dongargaon is 4323 out of a total population of 7159, representing approximately 60.4% literacy.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- Total population: 7,159
- Literate population: 4,323
- No additional information is needed as the structured data provides complete figures for both total and literate populations.
- If further context (e.g., literacy rate trends, historical data, or comparisons with other regions) were required, the Wikipedia article or other sources would need to be consulted.
- The text context (Wikipedia article) serves as the source of the structured data.
- The structured data (table) provides the exact numbers needed to answer the question.
- The answer combines both sources for accuracy and completeness.
