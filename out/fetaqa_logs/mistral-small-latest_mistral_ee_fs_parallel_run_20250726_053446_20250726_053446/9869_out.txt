---
- The question is a **temporal factual query** (roles in a specific year).
- The **text context** provides the film titles and roles, while the **structured data** organizes this information clearly.
- The answer is derived by **extracting the roles from the 1978 entries** in the filmography table.
- The **confidence is high** because the data is consistent and directly answers the question.
