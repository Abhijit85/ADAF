=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "What were the total area and holdings under coffee in India in 2001-2002?",
  "Factual Answer": "In 2001-2002, India had a total of 178308 coffee holdings, covering an area of 346995 hectares (857440 acres) under coffee cultivation.",

}
```

Answer Echoes:
- "Numbers (2001–2002)" which indicates the total number of holdings.
- "Area of holding" which indicates the total area under coffee cultivation.
- The total number of holdings (178,308) in the row labeled "Total" under the column "Numbers (2001–2002)".
- The total area of holdings (346,995 hectares) in the same row under the column "Area of holding".
- **Total number of coffee holdings**: 178,308
- **Total area under coffee cultivation**: 346,995 hectares (857,440 acres)
