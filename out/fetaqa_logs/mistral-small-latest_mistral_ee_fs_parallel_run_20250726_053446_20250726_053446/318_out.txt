Answer Echoes:
- The provided text context is from Zachery Ty Bryan's filmography on Wikipedia.
- The table lists films with columns for **Year, Title, Role, and Notes**.
- The highlighted row indicates the film **"The Game of Their Lives"** (2005), where the role **"Harry Keough"** is listed.
- The name **"Zachery"** does not appear in the table, nor is there any indication that Zachery Ty Bryan acted in this film.
- The structured data (table) confirms that **"Harry Keough"** is the role listed for 2005, but no connection to Zachery is made.
- No other 2005 films are listed in the table, and no alternate names or nicknames are provided.
- If "Zachery" refers to an alternate name or nickname for another actor in the table, additional context would be needed to confirm.
