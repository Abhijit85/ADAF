```json
{
  "Question": "How good a coach was Paddy Driscoll while at Marquette?",
  "Factual Answer": "Paddy Driscoll's coaching performance at Marquette was mediocre. Over four seasons (1937–1940), his teams compiled a combined record of 10 wins, 23 losses, and 1 tie. Only one season (1939) resulted in a non-losing record (4–4), while the other three seasons ended with losing records. The overall win percentage (30.3%) suggests he struggled to achieve consistent success. The data indicates he was not a highly effective coach during this tenure.",
