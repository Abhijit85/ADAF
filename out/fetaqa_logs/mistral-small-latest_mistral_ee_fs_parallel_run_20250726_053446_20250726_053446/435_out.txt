{
  "Question": "How is General Electric F110 better than the Pratt & Whitney TF30?",
  "Factual Answer": "The General Electric F110 outperforms the Pratt & Whitney TF30 in terms of overall pressure ratio (30:1 vs. 20:1), indicating greater efficiency and thrust. Additionally, the F110 is used in more advanced fighter jets (F-15, F-16), while the TF30 is found in older aircraft (F-111). This makes the F110 a more advanced and capable engine.",
