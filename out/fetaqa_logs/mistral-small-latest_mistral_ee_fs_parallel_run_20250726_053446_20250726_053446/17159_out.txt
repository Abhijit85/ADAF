{
  "Question": "What were Canas' teams and number of appearances when he played in La Liga as well as for Swansea City before 2014–15?",
  "Factual Answer": "Before the 2014–15 season, José Cañas played in La Liga for Betis, making 51 league appearances (across 2008–09, 2011–12, and 2012–13). For Swansea City (2013–14), he made 35 total appearances (23 in the league, 3 in cup competitions, and 9 in other matches).",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- **La Liga Teams**:
- **Betis**: Played in La Liga during 2008–09, 2011–12, and 2012–13.
- Total appearances: 2 (2008–09) + 22 (2011–12) + 27 (2012–13) = 51 league appearances.
- **Espanyol**: Played in La Liga during 2014–15 and 2015–16.
- However, the question specifies "before 2014–15," so only Betis is relevant for La Liga.
- **Swansea City**:
- Played in the 2013–14 season (Premier League).
- Total appearances: 23 (league) + 3 (cup) + 9 (other) = 35 total appearances.
- **La Liga Teams and Appearances**: Betis (51 league appearances).
- **Swansea City Appearances (before 2014–15)**: 35 total appearances (23 league, 3 cup, 9 other).
- **La Liga Teams**: Betis (2008–09, 2011–12, 2012–13) and Espanyol (2014–15, 2015–16).
- **Swansea City**: Played in the 2013–14 season (Premier League) before the 2014–15 season.
- **La Liga Teams**:
- **Betis**: 51 league appearances (2008–09: 2, 2011–12: 22, 2012–13: 27).
- **Espanyol**: Not relevant for "before 2014–15."
- **Swansea City (2013–14)**:
- **Total Appearances**: 35 (23 league, 3 cup, 9 other).
- **La Liga Teams and Appearances**:
- **Betis**: 51 league appearances (2008–09, 2011–12, 2012–13).
- **Swansea City Appearances (before 2014–15)**:
