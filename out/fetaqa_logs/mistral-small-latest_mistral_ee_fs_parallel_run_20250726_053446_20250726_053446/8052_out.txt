=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "The RaQ systems were equipped with RM5230 or RM5231 CPUs but later models used AMD K6-2 chips and which CPUs were used for the final models?",
  "Factual Answer": "The final RaQ models, the Cobalt RaQ XTR and Cobalt RaQ 550, were equipped with Intel Pentium III CPUs.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The RaQ systems initially used RM5230 (Cobalt RaQ) and RM5231 (Cobalt RaQ 2) CPUs.
- Later models transitioned to AMD K6-2 (Cobalt RaQ 3) and AMD K6 3D (Cobalt RaQ 4) CPUs.
- The final models listed are the Cobalt RaQ XTR and Cobalt RaQ 550, which used Intel Pentium III CPUs.
- Early models (RaQ, RaQ 2) used RM5230 and RM5231 CPUs.
- Mid-range models (RaQ 3, RaQ 4) transitioned to AMD K6-2 and AMD K6 3D CPUs.
- The final models (RaQ XTR, RaQ 550) used Intel Pentium III CPUs.
- **RaQ (1st gen)**: RM5230
- **RaQ 2**: RM5231
- **RaQ 3**: AMD K6-2
- **RaQ 4**: AMD K6 3D
- **RaQ XTR & RaQ 550 (final models)**: Intel Pentium III
