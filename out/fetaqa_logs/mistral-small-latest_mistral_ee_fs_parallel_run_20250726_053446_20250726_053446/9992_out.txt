✅ Success on attempt 1

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "In what Tamil films did Madhumitha appear in 2005?",
  "Factual Answer": "Madhumitha appeared in the Tamil film *Kudaikul Mazhai* in 2005.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The entry for "Kudaikul Mazhai" (2005) has the role "Madhumitha" and the language "Tamil."
- If the question had asked for additional details (e.g., co-stars, director, or plot summary), those would not be available in the current structured data.
- No other Tamil films from 2005 are listed in the provided data, so *Kudaikul Mazhai* is the only confirmed film.
