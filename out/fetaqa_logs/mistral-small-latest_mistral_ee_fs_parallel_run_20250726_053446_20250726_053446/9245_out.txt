=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "How much weight was sunk by SM UB-46?",
  "Factual Answer": "The total weight sunk by SM UB-46 is 8099 tons, as confirmed by the sum of the individual ship tonnages (Kohina Maru: 3164 tons, Basileios: 488 tons, Huntsfall: 4331 tons, Melanie: 116 tons).",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- **Ship names** (e.g., *Kohina Maru, Basileios, Huntsfall, Melanie*)
- **Nationality** (e.g., Japanese, Greek, British)
- **Tonnage** (weight of each ship)
- **Fate** (how they were sunk, e.g., torpedoed, mined)
- **Dates** (when each sinking occurred)
- **Individual ship tonnages** (e.g., *Kohina Maru: 3,164 tons, Basileios: 488 tons, Huntsfall: 4,331 tons, Melanie: 116 tons*)
- **Total tonnage sunk** (explicitly stated as **8,099 tons** in the "Total" row).
- 3,164 (Kohina Maru) + 488 (Basileios) + 4,331 (Huntsfall) + 116 (Melanie) = **8,099 tons**.
