=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "What are the fourth, third and second most populated cities of Paraguay?",
  "Factual Answer": "The second, third, and fourth most populated cities of Paraguay according to the 2002 Census are: 1. San Lorenzo (2nd, 204356 people), 2. Luque (3rd, 170986 people), 3. Capiatá (4th, 154274 people).",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- **Second most populated city**: San Lorenzo (204,356 people)
- **Third most populated city**: Luque (170,986 people)
- **Fourth most populated city**: Capiatá (154,274 people)
- The **most populated city** (1st rank) is not provided in the structured data. If needed, it would require additional data (e.g., Asuncion, which is typically the largest city in Paraguay).
- The **fifth most populated city** (Capiatá) is included, but the question only asks for the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th.
