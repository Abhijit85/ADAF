=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "What did the top two candidates achieve in the 2015 By-election?",
  "Factual Answer": "In the 2015 by-election for NA-161 (Lodhran-II), the top two candidates achieved the following: Jahangir Khan Tareen (PTI) won with 138719 votes (56.05%), and Muhammad Saddique Khan Baloch (PML-N) secured 99933 votes (40.38%).",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- **Jahangir Khan Tareen (PTI)** won with **138,719 votes (56.05%)**.
- **Muhammad Saddique Khan Baloch (PML-N)** secured **99,933 votes (40.38%)**.
- **Jahangir Khan Tareen (PTI)** won with **138,719 votes (56.05%)**.
- **Muhammad Saddique Khan Baloch (PML-N)** secured **99,933 votes (40.38%)**.
- No additional context (e.g., reasons for the by-election, voter turnout details beyond what's already provided) is required to answer the question.
- The text context provides the election name and source, while the structured data supplies the vote counts and percentages. Both sources align perfectly to answer the question comprehensively.
