{
  "Question": "Have any of the world's twelve largest artificial islands been used for airports?",
  "Factual Answer": "Yes, two of the world's twelve largest artificial islands have been used for airports: Kansai International Airport (Osaka, Japan, built in 1994, size 10.68 km²) and Chūbu Centrair International Airport (Tokoname, Japan, built in 2005, size 6.8 km²).",

Answer Echoes:
---
- **Text Context**: Provides the broader framework of artificial islands and their uses.
- **Structured Data**: Confirms specific instances (airports) with precise details (names, locations, sizes, years).
- **Consistency**: Both sources align perfectly, reinforcing the answer's accuracy.
