=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "Who are the people in the executive branch of Russia?",
  "Factual Answer": "The executive branch of Russia includes the President (Vladimir Putin) and the Prime Minister (Dmitry Medvedev). For a complete list of all executive branch members, additional details (such as deputy prime ministers or ministers) would be required.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "Medium"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- **President**: Vladimir Putin (United Russia, since 7 May 2012)
- **Prime Minister**: Dmitry Medvedev (United Russia, since 8 May 2012)
- **President**: Vladimir Putin (United Russia, since 7 May 2012)
- **Prime Minister**: Dmitry Medvedev (United Russia, since 8 May 2012)
- **High** for the President and Prime Minister (explicitly listed in structured data).
- **Medium** overall because the text does not confirm if other officials (e.g., deputy prime ministers, ministers) are part of the executive branch.
- The full composition of the executive branch (e.g., deputy prime ministers, ministers, or other officials) is not provided in the given sources.
- Additional context (e.g., from other sections of the Wikipedia page or official government sources) would be needed for a complete answer.
