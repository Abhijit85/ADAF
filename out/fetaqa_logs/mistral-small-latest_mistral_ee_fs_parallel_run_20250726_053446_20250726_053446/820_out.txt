=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "Which Kannada films did Rahul Preet Singh star in?",
  "Factual Answer": "The provided sources (text and structured data) do not contain any information about Rahul Preet Singh or his roles in Kannada films. The data does not include his filmography, and the text context refers to Rakul Preet Singh, a different individual. Additional verified sources are required to answer this question accurately.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "Low"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The provided text context is from Rakul Preet Singh's filmography on Wikipedia.
- The text does not mention **Rahul Preet Singh** (a different name) or any Kannada films.
- The filmography section only lists Rakul Preet Singh's films, not Rahul Preet Singh's.
- The structured data (filmography table) does not contain any entries for **Rahul Preet Singh**.
- The highlighted cells (rows 1 and 26, columns 0, 1, 4, and 3) do not provide relevant information about Kannada films or Rahul Preet Singh.
- The answer is based on the absence of relevant data in the given sources.
- To answer this question accurately, we would need:
- A verified filmography of **Rahul Preet Singh** (not Rakul Preet Singh).
- Specific details about his Kannada film roles, if any.
