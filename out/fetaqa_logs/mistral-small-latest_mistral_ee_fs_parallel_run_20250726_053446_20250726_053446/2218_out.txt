=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "When was 'The Mastered by Guy at The Exchange' first released and by which label?",
  "Factual Answer": "The album 'Mastered by Guy at The Exchange' was first released on 2 September 2002 under the label Domino in the United Kingdom.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The answer is directly supported by the structured data (table) from the Wikipedia page.
- The release date and label are explicitly mentioned in the earliest entry (UK release).
- The table does not confirm whether "The Mastered by Guy at The Exchange" is the full title of the album or if it is a placeholder.
- If the actual album title differs, the answer may need adjustment.
