  "Question": "What are the differences between the Boeing 777-8 and the Boeing 777-9?",
  "Factual Answer": "The Boeing 777-8 and 777-9 differ in several key aspects: 1) Seating Capacity: The 777-9 accommodates more passengers (414 in 2-class vs. 365 in the 777-8) and includes a 3-class configuration (349 seats), which the 777-8 lacks. 2) Lower Deck: Only the 777-9 has a lower deck with 48 seats (26 forward + 22 aft). 3) Cargo Capacity: The 777-9 has a cargo capacity of 8131 cu ft (230.2 m³), while the 777-8 does not have this specification. 4) Dimensions: The 777-9 is longer (251 ft 9 in vs. 229 ft 0 in) and slightly taller (64 ft 7 in vs. 64 ft 0 in). 5) Range: The 777-8 has a longer range (8690 nmi / 16090 km) compared to the 777-9 (7525 nmi / 13940 km). 6) Payload and Weight: The 777-9 has a max payload of 162000 lb (73500 kg) and an operating empty weight (OEW) of 400000 lb (181400 kg), while these metrics are not specified for the 777-8.",

Answer Echoes:
- 777-8: 365 seats (2-class) or not applicable (3-class).
- 777-9: 414 seats (2-class, 42J + 372Y) or 349 seats (3-class, 8F + 49J + 292Y).
- 777-8: 229 ft 0 in (69.8 m).
- 777-9: 251 ft 9 in (76.7 m).
- 777-8: 64 ft 0 in (19.5 m).
- 777-9: 64 ft 7 in (19.7 m).
- 777-8: 8,690 nmi / 16,090 km.
- 777-9: 7,525 nmi / 13,940 km.
- **Seating Capacity**: The 777-9 has higher seating capacity in both 2-class (414 vs. 365) and 3-class (349 vs. not applicable) configurations.
- **Lower Deck**: Only the 777-9 has a lower deck with 48 seats.
- **Cargo Capacity**: Only the 777-9 has a cargo capacity of 8,131 cu ft (230.2 m³).
- **Dimensions**: The 777-9 is longer (251 ft 9 in vs. 229 ft 0 in) and slightly taller (64 ft 7 in vs. 64 ft 0 in).
- **Range**: The 777-8 has a longer range (8,690 nmi vs. 7,525 nmi).
- **Payload and OEW**: Only the 777-9 has specified max payload (162,000 lb) and OEW (400,000 lb).
- No additional information is needed, as the structured data and text context provide a complete comparison.
