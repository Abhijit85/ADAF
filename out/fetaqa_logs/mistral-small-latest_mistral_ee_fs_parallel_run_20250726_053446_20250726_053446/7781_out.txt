=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

```json
{
  "Question": "What is the categorization of the M101 and NGC 6365 galaxies?",
  "Factual Answer": "M101 is categorized as a face-on spiral galaxy. NGC 6365 is categorized as an interacting pair of galaxies (with one galaxy viewed edge-on).",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}
```

Answer Echoes:
- The table provides information about galaxies, including their Arp Number, Common Name, and Notes.
- For **M101**, the "Notes" column states: "Face-on spiral galaxy with five notable companion galaxies."
- For **NGC 6365**, the "Notes" column states: "Interacting pair of galaxies, with one galaxy viewed edge-on."
- **M101** is categorized as a **face-on spiral galaxy**.
- **NGC 6365** is categorized as an **interacting pair of galaxies** (with one galaxy viewed edge-on).
- The text context from the *Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies* describes **M101** as a "face-on spiral galaxy with five notable companion galaxies."
- **NGC 6365** is described as an "interacting pair of galaxies, with one galaxy viewed edge-on."
- The structured data confirms:
- **M101** is categorized as a **face-on spiral galaxy**.
- **NGC 6365** is categorized as an **interacting pair of galaxies** (with one galaxy viewed edge-on).
- **M101** is a **face-on spiral galaxy**.
- **NGC 6365** is an **interacting pair of galaxies** (with one galaxy viewed edge-on).
- The answer is directly supported by both the text context and structured data, with no contradictions.
- None. The provided sources fully address the question.
---
- **M101** is categorized as a **face-on spiral galaxy**.
- **NGC 6365** is categorized as an **interacting pair of galaxies** (with one galaxy viewed edge-on).
