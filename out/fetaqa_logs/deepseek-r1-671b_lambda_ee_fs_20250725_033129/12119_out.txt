=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "How good a coach was Paddy Driscoll while at Marquette?",
  "Factual Answer": "The available data does not confirm Paddy Driscoll's coaching tenure at Marquette or provide sufficient evidence to evaluate his performance. Marquette's football records from 1937–1940 show a combined 10–23–1 record, but the structured data explicitly states no mention of Driscoll or coaching staff. The text context (Wikipedia) also lacks details about his role at Marquette. Without confirmation of his employment dates, coaching metrics, or historical context for these seasons, no assessment of his coaching quality can be made.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "Low"
}
