=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "What is the difference between the highest and lowest, winning and losing polls, respectively.",
  "Factual Answer": "The difference between the highest (131 votes for James Stuart-Wortley) and lowest polls (63 votes for Guise Brittan) is **68 votes**. The winning vs. losing majority (margin) is explicitly stated as **60 votes** in the structured data.",
  "Source": "data",
  "Confidence": "High"
}

Answer Echoes:
- **Highest vs. Lowest Polls**: 131 (James Stuart-Wortley) − 63 (Guise Brittan) = **68 votes**.
- **Winning vs. Losing Majority**: The majority (winning margin) is **60 votes**, as stated in the data.
- Structured data confirms vote counts for candidates: James Stuart-Wortley (131), Jerningham Wakefield (123), Guise Brittan (63).
- The "Majority" row explicitly states a margin of 60 votes.
- Highest votes: 131 (James Stuart-Wortley)
- Lowest votes: 63 (Guise Brittan)
- **Difference**: \(131 - 63 = 68\) votes.
- The stated majority (winning margin) is **60 votes**, as per the "Majority" row in the structured data.
