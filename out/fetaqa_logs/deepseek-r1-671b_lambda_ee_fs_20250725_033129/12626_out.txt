=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "1. What church is a part of the Vågøy parish in the Molde arch-deanery, and what Diocese is it in?",
  "Factual Answer": "Vågøy Church is part of the Vågøy parish (administratively combined with Myrbostad as 'Vågøy og Myrbostad' parish) in the Molde arch-deanery. It belongs to the Møre Diocese, as Fræna municipality falls under Møre og Romsdal county, which is part of the Church of Norway's Møre Diocese.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "Medium"
}

Answer Echoes:
- The structured data confirms that **Vågøy Church** (1904) is part of the "Vågøy og Myrbostad" parish in Fræna municipality.
- Norwegian dioceses follow geographic boundaries, and Møre og Romsdal county is part of the **Møre Diocese**.
- *Reason*: While the parish and church affiliation with Fræna municipality and Molde arch-deanery is strongly implied by the text's section heading ("Molde domprosti"), the diocese is inferred from Norway’s geographic-administrative structure (not explicitly stated in the data).
