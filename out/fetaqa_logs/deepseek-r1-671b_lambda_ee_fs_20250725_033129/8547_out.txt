=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "1. What happened with Reginald II?",
  "Factual Answer": "Reginald II died in 1097, ending his 10-year rule as Count of Burgundy (1087–1097). His death triggered a succession conflict or division of authority, with both his son William II the German and his great-uncle Stephen I the Rash beginning their reigns in the same year (1097). This overlapping succession indicates political instability or competing claims within the House of Ivrea following his death.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}

Answer Echoes:
- Reginald II ruled from 12 November 1087 until his death in 1097.
- His son, William II the German, succeeded him in 1097.
- Simultaneously, Stephen I the Rash (Reginald II’s great-uncle) is listed as beginning his reign in 1097, suggesting a contested or divided succession.
