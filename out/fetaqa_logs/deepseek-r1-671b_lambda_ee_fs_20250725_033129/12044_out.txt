=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "How well did Billy Reynolds perform as a player for Vale in the 222 games he played?",
  "Factual Answer": "The question contains a factual error. According to the available structured data, '222 games' refers to Burslem Port Vale's total club appearances across competitions, not Billy Reynolds' individual record. No statistics about Reynolds' performance (appearances, goals, or contributions) are present in the provided data, making it impossible to assess his performance based on this information.",
  "Source": "data/combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}

Answer Echoes:
- Player-specific statistics for Billy Reynolds (goals, appearances, etc.).
- Confirmation that "Vale" refers to Burslem Port Vale and whether Billy Reynolds played for this club during the seasons listed.
