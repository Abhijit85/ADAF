=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "For how much gross register tons (GRT) did the German submarine U-409 sink and/or damaged ?",
  "Factual Answer": "The provided data does not allow determination of GRT sunk/damaged by U-409. The structured table lists ships with tonnage values but lacks submarine identifiers, and the text references U-409's raiding history section without including its specific statistics.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "Low"
}

Answer Echoes:
- Explicit attribution of these ships to U-409 (e.g., historical records confirming U-409 sank/damaged these vessels).
- Submarine identifiers linked to the listed ships.
- Direct attribution of the listed ships to U-409 (e.g., historical records or the missing content from the "Summary of raiding history" section).
- Submarine identifiers (e.g., U-409) in the structured data to confirm responsibility for specific sinkings/damages.
