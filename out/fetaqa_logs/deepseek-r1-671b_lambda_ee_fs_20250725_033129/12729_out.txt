{
  "Question": "What characters did Ellise Chappell play in 2016 and on what shows?",
  "Factual Answer": "The structured data lists 'Wendy Roberts' in *New Blood* (BBC One) and 'Jennifer Strange' in *The Last Dragonslayer* (Sky One) as 2016 roles, but the provided sources lack explicit attribution to Ellise Chappell. No confirmation exists in the text context or structured data columns (which omit actor names), preventing definitive verification.",
