=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "How is General Electric F110 better than the Pratt & Whitney TF30?",
  "Factual Answer": "The General Electric F110 outperforms the Pratt & Whitney TF30 primarily due to its significantly higher overall pressure ratio (30:1 vs. 20:1), which improves thermal efficiency, enabling better thrust and fuel economy. Additionally, the F110’s broader application in advanced fighter jets like the F-15 and F-16 (beyond shared use in the F-14) underscores its superior engineering and reliability.",
