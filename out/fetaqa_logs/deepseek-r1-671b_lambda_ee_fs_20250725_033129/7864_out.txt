=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "How many Arabs and Jews were injured or killed in the 1929 Palestine riots?",
  "Factual Answer": "During the 1929 Palestine riots, Jewish casualties included 133 killed and 198–241 injured. Arab casualties amounted to at least 116 killed and 232 injured, with historical records indicating both numbers could be higher (denoted by '+' notation in source data).",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}

Answer Echoes:
- **Jews**: 133 killed, 198–241 injured.
- **Arabs**: At least 116 killed (possibly more) and at least 232 injured (possibly more).
- **Jews**: 133 killed, 198–241 injured.
- **Arabs**: At least 116 killed (with possible higher numbers) and at least 232 injured (also possibly higher).
- **Jewish casualties**: 133 killed, 198–241 injured.
- **Arab casualties**: At least 116 killed and 232 injured, with both numbers potentially higher (as indicated by the "+" notation).
