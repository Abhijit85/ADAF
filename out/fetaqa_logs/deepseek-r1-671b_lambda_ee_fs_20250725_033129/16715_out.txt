{
  "Question": "What was Cicero doing in the Film \"The Princess and the Frog\"?",
  "Factual Answer": "Roger Cicero provided the German voice acting for the character **Prince Naveen** in *The Princess and the Frog* (2009). The confusion likely stems from his surname (Cicero) being mistaken for a character name. No character named 'Cicero' exists in the film.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}

Answer Echoes:
- Clarification on whether "Cicero" refers to a character, actor, or crew member not listed in the table.
- Confirmation if the query pertains to a specific language version or adaptation not covered in the provided data.
