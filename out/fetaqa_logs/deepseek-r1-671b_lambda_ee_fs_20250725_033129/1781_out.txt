=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "Did Constantina Diță improve in the marathon event over time?",
  "Factual Answer": "Yes, Constantina Diță improved in the marathon event over time, achieving her peak performance at the 2008 Olympics with a personal best time of 2:26:44 and a gold medal. Her times progressed from 2:34:35 (1998) to 2:30:38 (2001) before reaching her career-best result in 2008. While her performance declined post-2008 (e.g., 2:41:34 in 2012), her Olympic victory and time progression from 1998 to 2008 demonstrate significant improvement over this period.",
