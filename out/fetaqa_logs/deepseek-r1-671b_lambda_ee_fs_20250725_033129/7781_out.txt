=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "1. What is the categorization of the M101 and NGC 6365 galaxies?",
  "Factual Answer": "M101 (Arp 26) is categorized as a face-on spiral galaxy, while NGC 6365 (Arp 30) is classified as an interacting pair of galaxies, with one galaxy viewed edge-on. These classifications originate from Halton Arp’s *Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies*, where they are highlighted for their unusual structures in the 'Spiral galaxies with one heavy arm' category.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}

Answer Echoes:
- **M101** is categorized as **Arp 26**, a face-on spiral galaxy.
- **NGC 6365** is categorized as **Arp 30**, an interacting pair of galaxies.
- **M101** is classified as **Arp 26** in the Atlas, explicitly described as a "face-on spiral galaxy."
- **NGC 6365** is classified as **Arp 30**, defined as an "interacting pair of galaxies, with one galaxy viewed edge-on."
- **M101** is categorized as **Arp 26**, a face-on spiral galaxy.
- **NGC 6365** is categorized as **Arp 30**, an interacting pair of galaxies (one edge-on).
