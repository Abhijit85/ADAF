=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "How many total games did Jack Miller play in 1905 and 1906, respectively, while playing at Stoke?",
  "Factual Answer": "The available data provides totals for full seasons, not individual calendar years. Jack Miller played **38 games** in the **1905–06 season** (spanning both 1905 and 1906) and **25 games** in the **1906–07 season** (spanning both 1906 and 1907). The exact number of games played in **1905** versus **1906** individually cannot be determined from the provided sources.",
