=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "How could the location of Des Moines be described in terms of where it is by Pleasant Hill and Iowa 163?",
  "Factual Answer": "Des Moines is located west of Pleasant Hill, where Iowa 163 (E University Avenue) is situated. This is confirmed by the sequential mile markers along the bypass: Des Moines exits (e.g., mile 6.985 and 11.093) precede Pleasant Hill's exits (e.g., mile 17.905 and 20.016), indicating a west-to-east geographic order.",
