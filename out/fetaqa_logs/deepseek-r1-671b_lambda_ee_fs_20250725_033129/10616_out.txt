=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "1. Where does WDNO broadcast and on what frequencies?",
  "Factual Answer": "WDNO’s broadcast locations and frequencies cannot be determined from the provided data. The structured table lacks WDNO entries, and the text context only mentions it as a radio station with translator stations without specifying technical details. FCC records or updated databases would be required for accurate information.",
