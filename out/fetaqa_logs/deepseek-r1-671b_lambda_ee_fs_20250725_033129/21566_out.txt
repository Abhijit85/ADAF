=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "Which channels was WNYJ-TV transmitted on when the station was multiplexed?",
  "Factual Answer": "WNYJ-TV was transmitted on channels 66.1, 66.2, and 66.6 when multiplexed. These carried distinct programming streams: 66.1 (CNC World), 66.2 (MHz Worldview), and 66.6 (WFME-FM audio-only broadcast).",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}

Answer Echoes:
- **66.1**: Transmits "CNC World" (480i video, 4:3 aspect ratio)
- **66.2**: Transmits "MHz Worldview" (480i video, 4:3 aspect ratio)
- **66.6**: Transmits "WFME-FM audio" (audio-only format)
- **66.1**: Broadcasting "CNC World"
- **66.2**: Broadcasting "MHz Worldview"
- **66.6**: Transmitting "WFME-FM audio"
