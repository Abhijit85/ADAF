=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "Did SX17 approach the Moon or Earth closer in 2017?",
  "Factual Answer": "In 2017, SX17 approached Earth closer than the Moon. The asteroid’s closest distance to Earth was 87100 km on 2 October, compared to 259900 km from the Moon on 1 October.",
  "Source": "data",
  "Confidence": "High"
}

Answer Echoes:
- 1 October 2017: Moon approach at **259,900 km (0.001737 AU)**.
- 2 October 2017: Earth approach at **87,100 km (0.000582 AU)**.
