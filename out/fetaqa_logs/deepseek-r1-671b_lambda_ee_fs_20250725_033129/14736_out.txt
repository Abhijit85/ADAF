=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "Which Fighter Groups used the Bf 109 and where were they posted?",
  "Factual Answer": "The provided sources do not definitively link any Fighter Groups to Bf 109 usage. While the text context references 'Messerschmitt Bf 109 in Yugoslav service' under the Royal Yugoslav Air Force, it lacks specific group details. The structured data lists Fighter Groups (e.g., 31st, 32nd, 33rd) and their locations (Prnjavor, Zemun, Bosanski Aleksandrovac), but aircraft models like the Bf 109 are not specified in either the table's 'Aircraft' column or 'Notes'.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "Low"
