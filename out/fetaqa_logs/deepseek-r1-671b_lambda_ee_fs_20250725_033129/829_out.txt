=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "Which HX 229 ships were sunk by U-221 and when?",
  "Factual Answer": "U-221 sank two HX 229 convoy ships on 18 March 1943: *William Q Gresham* (United States) and *Canadian Star* (United Kingdom). This attribution relies on structured attack records dated 16–19 March 1943, which align with HX 229's historical engagement period, though the convoy identifier is not explicitly stated in the source data.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}

Answer Echoes:
- *William Q Gresham* (United States) on 18 March 1943.
- *Canadian Star* (United Kingdom) on 18 March 1943.
- *William Q Gresham* (United States)
- *Canadian Star* (United Kingdom)
- The dates (18 March 1943) directly match the timeframe of HX 229's engagements.
- The structured data explicitly attributes both sinkings to U-221.
