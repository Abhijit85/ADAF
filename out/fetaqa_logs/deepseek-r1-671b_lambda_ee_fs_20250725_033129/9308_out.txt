=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "What roles did Simon Nash star in?",
  "Factual Answer": "The provided sources do not list any roles for Simon Nash. The structured data table references characters like 'Ten Cents' in *TUGS* (1988) and 'Garth Stubbs' in *Birds of a Feather* (1989), but Simon Nash's name is absent from all entries. His Wikipedia text context similarly lacks explicit mentions of specific acting roles.",
