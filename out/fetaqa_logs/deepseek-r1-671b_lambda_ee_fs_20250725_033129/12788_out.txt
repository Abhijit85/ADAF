=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "What team did Bobo join after leaving Sao Paulo and in what year?",
  "Factual Answer": "The provided sources do not contain sufficient information to determine which team Bobô joined after leaving São Paulo or the year of the transfer. The structured data tracks club competitions rather than player transfers, and the text context from the 'Honors' section of Bobô’s Wikipedia page does not mention career timeline details.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "Low"
}

Answer Echoes:
- Data about Bobo’s career transfers (teams and years) is missing.
- The table only tracks club participation in competitions, not player affiliations.
- Explicit details about Bobô’s career timeline, including departure dates from São Paulo and subsequent club signings.
- Player transfer records or career history sections from his Wikipedia page (not limited to the "Honors" section).
- Structured data linking Bobô to specific clubs and years outside of competition participation.
