=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "Who won the 1987 general election?",
  "Factual Answer": "There is no 1987 Thai general election in historical records. The Democrat Party won the 1986 Thai general election with 100 seats. The structured data's reference to 1987 likely contains a typographical error, as Thailand held elections in 1986 and 1988.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "Low"
}

Answer Echoes:
- Verification of whether Thailand held a general election in 1987 (historical records indicate elections occurred in 1986 and 1988, not 1987).
- Clarification of the structured data’s reference to 1987 (likely a typographical error for 1986).
