=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "1. What roles did Mena Massoud play on television in the 2015 film Jared Malik and Tom Clancy's series Jack Ryan?",
  "Factual Answer": "Mena Massoud did not appear in a 2015 film titled *Jared Malik*. He played **Jared Malik** in the **2015 TV series *Open Heart*** (recurring role). In *Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan* (TV series, 2018), he portrayed **Tarek Kassar**. The question conflates a TV role with a nonexistent film and misattributes the timeline for *Jack Ryan*.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}

Answer Echoes:
- In 2015, he played **Jared Malik** in *Open Heart* (listed as a recurring role in a TV series, not a film).
- In 2018, he played **Tarek Kassar** in *Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan* (TV series).
- Mena Massoud did not appear in a "2015 film Jared Malik" according to the data. He played **Jared Malik** in the **2015 TV series *Open Heart***.
- In *Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan* (TV series), he portrayed **Tarek Kassar**.
- The premise about a "2015 film Jared Malik" conflicts with the data. The role "Jared Malik" exists but is tied to the TV series *Open Heart*, not a film.
- Confirmation is needed if the question contains a typo or misattribution.
- **Jared Malik** was played by Massoud in the **2015 TV series *Open Heart*** (recurring role).
- **Tarek Kassar** was portrayed in the **2018 TV series *Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan***.
