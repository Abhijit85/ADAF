=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "1. What indicators determine the Times Higher Education World University Rankings?",
  "Factual Answer": "The Times Higher Education World University Rankings are determined by five weighted indicators: 1. **Industry Income – innovation** (2.5%): Measures research income from industry per academic staff. 2. **International Diversity** (5%): Combines international-to-domestic staff ratio (3%) and student ratio (2%). 3. **Teaching** (30%): Includes reputational surveys (15%), PhDs awarded per academic (6%), undergraduate-to-staff ratio (4.5%), income per academic (2.25%), and PhD/undergraduate degree awards ratio (2.25%). 4. **Research** (30%): Comprises reputational surveys (19.5%), scaled research income (5.25%), papers per researcher (4.5%), and public research income ratio (0.75%). 5. **Citations** (32.5%): Measures normalized citation impact per paper.",
