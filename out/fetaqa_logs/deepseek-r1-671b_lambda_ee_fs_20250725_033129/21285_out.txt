=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "How did the Free Democratic Party's voting record and number of seats compare to the Social Democratic Party's during the 1928 Swiss National Council election?",
  "Factual Answer": "In the 1928 Swiss National Council election, the Free Democratic Party and Social Democratic Party received nearly identical vote counts (220141 vs. 220135, a 6-vote difference) with equal percentages (27.4%). However, the Free Democratic Party secured 58 seats (-2 compared to the prior election), while the Social Democrats won 50 seats (+1). This discrepancy in seat allocation despite similar vote shares illustrates how proportional representation systems can produce uneven seat distributions due to factors like electoral districts or allocation rules.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}

Answer Echoes:
- Vote counts: Free Democratic Party (220,141) vs. Social Democratic Party (220,135) – a 6-vote difference.
- Vote percentages: Both parties at 27.4%.
- Seat allocation: Free Democrats secured 58 seats (-2 change from prior election), Social Democrats won 50 seats (+1 change).
