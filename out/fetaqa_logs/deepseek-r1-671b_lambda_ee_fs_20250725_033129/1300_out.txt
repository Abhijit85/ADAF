=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "What is the raiding of German submarine U-58 on 8 October 1940?",
  "Factual Answer": "On 8 October 1940, the British ship *Confield* (4956 tons) was sunk. However, neither the structured data nor the provided text context explicitly confirms German submarine U-58's involvement in this incident. Operational records for U-58 from the cited Wikipedia section do not mention this date, and no direct linkage between U-58 and the *Confield* is documented in the available sources.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "Low"
