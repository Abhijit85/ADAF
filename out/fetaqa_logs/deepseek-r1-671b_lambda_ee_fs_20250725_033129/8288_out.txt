=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "How much does the USS Rasher and USS Archerfish weight respectively?",
  "Factual Answer": "The USS Rasher is credited with sinking 99901 tons of enemy shipping, and the USS Archerfish with 59800 tons during WWII. The term 'weight' in this context refers to cumulative tonnage of enemy vessels sunk, not the submarines' physical displacement (their own weight).",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "Medium"
