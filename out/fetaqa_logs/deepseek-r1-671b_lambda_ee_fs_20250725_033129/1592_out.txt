=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "What is Abigail Ruston's personal best for indoor shot put and when did she set it?",
  "Factual Answer": "The structured data lists an indoor shot put record of 18.03 meters set on February 23, 2008, in Boston, Massachusetts. However, this record is not explicitly attributed to Abigail Ruston in the provided data, and her name is absent from the source table. Without direct confirmation from textual or additional contextual sources, this record cannot be definitively linked to her.",
  "Source": "data",
  "Confidence": "Low"
}

Answer Echoes:
- Confirmation that the highlighted indoor shot put record (18.03m, February 23, 2008) belongs to Abigail Ruston.
- The athlete’s name is absent from the provided data, making it impossible to definitively link the record to her without external verification.
