=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "1. What is Suffolk County Road and where does it begin and end at?",
  "Factual Answer": "Suffolk County Road refers to a network of county-maintained routes in Suffolk County, New York, designated with numbers such as CR 13 or CR 17. These roads do not form a single continuous route but are a system of individual segments. For example: CR 13 begins in Brentwood (at 0.0 mi/km) and extends westward as a Town of Islip Road, while another segment near Islandia starts at NY 454 and continues northeast as Old Nichols Road. The system as a whole has no unified start or end point, as each numbered route operates independently across the county.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "Medium"
}

Answer Echoes:
- **CR 13** begins in Brentwood (at 0.0 mi/km) and continues west as a Town of Islip Road.
- Another segment (likely CR 17 or a related route) connects to NY 454 in Islandia, continuing northeast as Old Nichols Road.
- **CR 13** begins in Brentwood (0.0 mi/km) and continues west as a Town of Islip Road.
- A segment in Islandia connects to NY 454 and continues northeast as Old Nichols Road.
- References to NY 111 and former CR 17 in Central Islip further illustrate the network’s complexity.
- **CR 13** begins in Brentwood and extends westward as a Town of Islip Road.
- Another segment near Islandia starts at NY 454 and continues northeast as Old Nichols Road.

                       'but are a system of individual segments. For example: '
                       'CR 13 begins in Brentwood (at 0.0 mi/km) and extends '
                       'westward as a Town of Islip Road, while another '
                       'segment near Islandia starts at NY 454 and continues '
                       'northeast as Old Nichols Road. The system as a whole '
                       'has no unified start or end point, as each numbered '
                       'route operates independently across the county.",\n'
