=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "Why was Ted Bank fired after leading Idaho to a combined 10-6-2 record in 1937 and 1938?",
  "Factual Answer": "The available data does not explicitly state why Ted Bank was fired. While Idaho’s football performance improved under his leadership in 1937–1938 (10–6–2 combined record), subsequent seasons (1939–1940) saw a sharp decline (3–13–1). However, the structured data does not confirm whether Bank coached during those later seasons or if other factors (e.g., administrative decisions, non-performance issues) contributed to his dismissal. External historical sources or university records would be required to determine the exact reasons.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "Low"
}

Answer Echoes:
- Confirmation of Ted Bank’s tenure period (e.g., whether he coached beyond 1938).
- Administrative, financial, or non-performance-related factors influencing the decision.
- Historical records or external sources detailing the specific reasons for his dismissal.
- Idaho’s football records from 1937–1938 (10–6–2 combined) show improved performance during those years.
- Records for 1939–1940 (3–13–1 combined) indicate a sharp decline. However, the structured data does not specify whether Ted Bank coached during these later seasons or if another coach was responsible.
- Ted Bank’s exact tenure dates (e.g., whether he coached beyond 1938).
- Documentation of administrative decisions, financial constraints, or non-performance issues leading to his dismissal.
- Direct historical accounts (e.g., news articles, university records) explaining the firing.
