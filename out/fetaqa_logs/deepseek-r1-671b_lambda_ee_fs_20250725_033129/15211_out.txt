=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "When was the Vale of Clwyd created and what can you tell me about the it's representatives from 2017?",
  "Factual Answer": "The available data does not specify the exact creation date of the Vale of Clwyd constituency, though the earliest recorded election in the provided records occurred in 1997. For the 2017 general election, Chris Ruane of the Labour Party was the representative elected for the constituency.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "Medium"
}

Answer Echoes:
- The earliest election recorded in the structured data is 1997, suggesting the constituency existed by then.
- The 2017 entry explicitly names Chris Ruane (Labour) as the representative.
- **Creation Date**: Medium (1997 is the earliest data point but not definitive).
- **2017 Representative**: High (explicitly confirmed in structured data).
- The constituency’s exact creation date requires consulting historical records or boundary commission documentation.
