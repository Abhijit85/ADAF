=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

{
  "Question": "How did Glenn M. Curtis perform as captain of the Sycamores?",
  "Factual Answer": "The available sources do not provide information about Glenn M. Curtis's performance as captain of the Sycamores. The text context exclusively discusses his head coaching record at Indiana State, while the structured data focuses on team-level statistics from 1938–1946 and lacks references to individual players, including Curtis's role as a captain.",
  "Source": "combined",
  "Confidence": "High"
}

Answer Echoes:
- Confirmation that Glenn M. Curtis was a player (not just a coach) for the Sycamores.
- Specific dates of his captaincy, individual statistics, leadership contributions, or contemporary accounts of his performance.
- Sources explicitly linking Curtis to the role of "captain" (player leadership role) rather than "coach."
