=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Which Fighter Groups used the Bf 109 and where were they posted?

**Factual Answer**: Based on the available information, it is not possible to definitively determine which specific Fighter Groups used the Bf 109 and their locations. The structured data provided lists Fighter Regiments and their respective Fighter Groups and locations, but it does not specify the aircraft type used by these groups. Additionally, the text context from the Wikipedia page titled "Messerschmitt Bf 109 in Yugoslav service" does not explicitly mention which Fighter Groups used the Bf 109. Therefore, additional historical records or military documentation would be required to provide a complete answer.

**Source**: Combined analysis of text context and structured data.

**Confidence**: Low, due to the lack of explicit information connecting the Bf 109 to specific Fighter Groups in the provided sources.

Answer Echoes:
- **Fighter Group**: 31st Fighter Group
- **Location**: Knić
- **Fighter Group**: 32nd Fighter Group
- **Location**: Prnjavor
- **Fighter Group**: 51st Fighter Group
- **Location**: Zemun
- **Question Type**: Factual, geographic
- **Information Needs**: Identification of Fighter Groups using the Bf 109 and their locations
- **Data Sources**: Text context from Wikipedia and structured data table
- **Text Primary**: Use the Wikipedia text as the main source to identify any mentions of the Bf 109.
- **Data Support**: Use structured data to confirm or supplement the locations of Fighter Groups.
