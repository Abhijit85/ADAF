=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Which awards was Giacchino nominated for in 2015?

**Factual Answer**: Based on the provided data and text analysis, there is no information available about Michael Giacchino's nominations in 2015. The structured data explicitly states that there are no entries for that year, and the text context from Wikipedia does not provide any relevant information either. Additional sources would be needed to determine Giacchino's nominations in 2015.

**Source**: Combined analysis of text and structured data

**Confidence**: Medium, due to the absence of specific data for 2015.
