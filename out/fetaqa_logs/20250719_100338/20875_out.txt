=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Why was Ted Bank fired after leading Idaho to a combined 10-6-2 record in 1937 and 1938?

**Factual Answer**: Ted Bank was likely fired due to the Idaho Vandals' low conference standings and lack of significant postseason success, despite achieving a combined 10-6-2 record in 1937 and 1938. While the team had a positive overall win-loss record, they finished 6th in the conference in 1937 and 7th in 1938, and did not participate in any bowl games or playoffs. This lack of competitiveness within the conference and absence of postseason achievements may have led to dissatisfaction with his performance as head coach, prompting the decision to fire him.
