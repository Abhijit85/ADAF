=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: How much does the six-digit model cost compared to the twelve-digit model?

**Factual Answer**: The six-digit model, identified as model "1206," costs $49.95 for the kit and $59.95 assembled. In contrast, the twelve-digit model, identified as model "1212," costs $89.95 for the kit and $99.95 assembled. Therefore, the twelve-digit model is more expensive than the six-digit model by $40.00 for both the kit and assembled prices.

**Source**: Combined analysis from structured data.

**Confidence**: High. The information is directly extracted from the structured data, providing a clear and accurate comparison between the two models' costs.

Answer Echoes:
- **Six-digit model**: The model "1206" is a handheld calculator with a 6-digit display and 12-digit calculation capability. Its kit price is $49.95, and the assembled price is $59.95.
- **Twelve-digit model**: The model "1212" is a handheld calculator with a 12-digit display. Its kit price is $89.95, and the assembled price is $99.95.
- The six-digit model "1206" has a kit price of $49.95 and an assembled price of $59.95.
- The twelve-digit model "1212" has a kit price of $89.95 and an assembled price of $99.95.
