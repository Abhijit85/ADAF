=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: How is General Electric F110 better than the Pratt & Whitney TF30?

**Factual Answer**: The General Electric F110 is better than the Pratt & Whitney TF30 primarily due to its higher overall pressure ratio. The F110 has an overall pressure ratio of 30:1, compared to the TF30's 20:1. A higher pressure ratio generally indicates better engine efficiency and performance, making the F110 more efficient and capable in its applications, which include aircraft like the F-14, F-15, and F-16. In contrast, the TF30 is used in the F-14 and F-111. The higher pressure ratio of the F110 suggests superior performance characteristics over the TF30.
