=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Which Swedish ships did U-21 sink?

**Factual Answer**: The available data lists two Swedish ships, Carl Henckel and Mars, that were sunk on 21 December 1939. However, there is no direct evidence or attribution in the provided data or text that confirms U-21 was responsible for sinking these ships. Additional historical records are required to determine if U-21 was involved in these actions.

**Source**: Combined analysis of text and structured data.

**Confidence**: Low, due to the lack of direct evidence linking U-21 to the sinking of Swedish ships.

Answer Echoes:
- Two Swedish ships are listed:
- **Carl Henckel**: Sunk on 21 December 1939
- **Mars**: Sunk on 21 December 1939
- **Question Type**: Factual
- **Information Needs**: Identification of Swedish ships sunk by U-21
- **Data Sources**: Text context from Wikipedia and structured data on ship fates
- **Reasoning Path**: Combine text and structured data to determine U-21's actions
- The structured data lists two Swedish ships, Carl Henckel and Mars, both sunk on 21 December 1939. However, it does not specify that U-21 was responsible for these sinkings.
- **Text Primary**: The text does not provide direct information about U-21's actions.
- **Data Support**: The structured data lists the ships and their fates but lacks attribution to U-21.
- **Consistency Check**: Both sources lack direct confirmation of U-21's involvement.
- **Complete Picture**: Additional historical records are needed for confirmation.
