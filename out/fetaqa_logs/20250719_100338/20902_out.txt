=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is Suffolk County Road and where does it begin and end at?

**Factual Answer**: Suffolk County Road begins at Brentwood, where it connects with County Route 13 (CR 13). It continues west as a Town of Islip Road. The structured data does not specify an endpoint for Suffolk County Road, but it mentions connections to New York State Route 111 (NY 111) in Central Islip and New York State Route 454 (NY 454) in Islandia.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text and structured data.

**Confidence**: Medium, due to the lack of specific information on the endpoint of Suffolk County Road.

Answer Echoes:
- **Question Type**: Geographic, factual
- **Information Needs**: Starting and ending points of Suffolk County Road
- **Data Sources**: Text context and structured data
- **Reasoning Path**: Combine geographic details from text with structured data
- The text context provides a list of county routes in Suffolk County, New York, specifically focusing on County Route 100.
- The structured data indicates that Suffolk County Road begins at Brentwood, connecting with CR 13. It continues west as a Town of Islip Road. The data does not specify an endpoint but mentions connections to NY 111 in Central Islip and NY 454 in Islandia.
- **Text Primary**: The text context provides the list of routes and their descriptions.
- **Data Support**: The structured data confirms the starting point and connections but lacks an endpoint.
- **Consistency Check**: Both sources align on the starting point but do not provide an endpoint.
- **Complete Picture**: The road begins at Brentwood, connects with CR 13, and continues west as a Town of Islip Road, with connections to NY 111 and NY 454.
