=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Did SX17 approach the Moon or Earth closer in 2017?

**Factual Answer**: SX17 approached Earth closer than the Moon in 2017. On 1 October 2017, SX17 was 0.001737 AU (0.676 LD; 259900 km) from the Moon, while on 2 October 2017, it was 0.000582 AU (0.226 LD; 87100 km) from Earth. This data indicates that SX17 was significantly closer to Earth than to the Moon.

**Source**: Structured data

**Confidence**: High

Answer Echoes:
- **Question Type**: Comparative, factual
- **Information Needs**: Determine which celestial body, the Moon or Earth, SX17 approached more closely in 2017.
- **Data Sources**: Text context and structured data
- **Reasoning Path**: Compare the nominal distances of SX17 from the Moon and Earth on specific dates in October 2017.
- The text context does not provide specific distance information but refers to approaches in 2017.
- On 1 October 2017, SX17 was 0.001737 AU (0.676 LD; 259,900 km) from the Moon.
- On 2 October 2017, SX17 was 0.000582 AU (0.226 LD; 87,100 km) from Earth.
- **Text Primary**: The text context provides a general reference to approaches in 2017.
- **Data Support**: The structured data provides specific distances, allowing for a precise comparison.
- **Consistency Check**: The structured data consistently shows that SX17 approached Earth more closely than the Moon.
- **Complete Picture**: The structured data provides a clear factual basis for the answer.
