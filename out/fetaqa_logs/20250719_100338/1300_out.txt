=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the raiding of German submarine U-58 on 8 October 1940?

**Factual Answer**: Based on the available information, there is no specific evidence or record of raiding activities by German submarine U-58 on 8 October 1940. The structured data indicates that the ship "Confield" from the United Kingdom was sunk on that date, but it does not attribute this action to U-58. Additionally, the text context does not provide details about U-58's operations on that specific date. To accurately determine the involvement of U-58, further historical records or naval logs would be required.

**Source**: Combined analysis of text and structured data.

**Confidence**: Low, due to the lack of direct evidence linking U-58 to any actions on the specified date.

Answer Echoes:
- **Question Type**: Temporal, factual
- **Information Needs**: Specific raiding activities of German submarine U-58 on 8 October 1940
- **Data Sources**: Text context from Wikipedia and structured data table
- **Reasoning Path**: Combine text and structured data to determine the involvement of U-58 in any raiding activities on the specified date
- **Temporal Information**: The text context provides a summary of raiding history for German submarine U-58, but does not specify activities on 8 October 1940.
- **Supporting Facts**: The structured data table lists the sinking of the ship "Confield" on 8 October 1940, but does not attribute this action to German submarine U-58.
- **Text Primary**: The text does not provide specific information about U-58's activities on 8 October 1940.
- **Data Support**: The structured data lists the sinking of "Confield" but does not link it to U-58.
- **Consistency Check**: Both sources lack direct evidence of U-58's involvement on the specified date.
- **Complete Picture**: Additional historical records are needed to confirm any involvement of U-58.
