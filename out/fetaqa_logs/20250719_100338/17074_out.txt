His penalty minutes (PIMs) decreased by 10 minutes, from 166 PIMs in the 2005-06 season to 156 PIMs in the 2006-07 season.

**Source**: Structured data analysis

**Confidence**: High, based on the structured data provided.

Answer Echoes:
- For the 2005-06 season with the Philadelphia Flyers, Brashear had:
- Points: 9
- PIMs: 166
- For the 2006-07 season with the Washington Capitals, Brashear had:
- Points: 13
- PIMs: 156
- Brashear's point total increased by 4 points (from 9 to 13).
- His PIMs decreased by 10 minutes (from 166 to 156).
- **Question Type**: Temporal, factual, comparative
- **Information Needs**: Brashear's PIMs and point total increase from the 2005-06 to the 2006-07 season
- **Data Sources**: Structured data table for numerical comparison
- **Reasoning Path**: Compare the structured data for the two seasons to determine the increase or decrease in points and PIMs
- No specific information about Brashear's PIMs or points is provided in the text context. The focus is on structured data.
- **2005-06 Season with Philadelphia Flyers**:
- Points: 9
- PIMs: 166
- **2006-07 Season with Washington Capitals**:
- Points: 13
- PIMs: 156
- **Text Primary**: Not applicable as the text does not provide specific numerical data.
- **Data Support**: Structured data provides the necessary numerical comparison.
- **Consistency Check**: Data is consistent and directly answers the question.
- **Complete Picture**: The structured data alone provides a complete answer.
- From the structured data, Brashear's points increased from 9 to 13, an increase of 4 points.
- His PIMs decreased from 166 to 156, a decrease of 10 minutes.
- Brashear's point total increased by 4 points from the previous season.
