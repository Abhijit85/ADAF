=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the categorization of the M101 and NGC 6365 galaxies?

**Factual Answer**: 
- **M101** is categorized as a "Face-on spiral galaxy."
- **NGC 6365** is categorized as an "Interacting pair of galaxies."

**Source**: Structured data

**Confidence**: High

The structured data provides clear and specific categorizations for both galaxies, ensuring a high confidence level in the accuracy of the answer. The text context did not provide additional details about these specific galaxies, so the structured data was the primary source for this answer.

Answer Echoes:
- **M101**: The notes describe it as a "Face-on spiral galaxy with five notable companion galaxies."
- **NGC 6365**: The notes describe it as an "Interacting pair of galaxies, with one galaxy viewed edge-on."
- **M101** is categorized as a "Face-on spiral galaxy."
- **NGC 6365** is categorized as an "Interacting pair of galaxies."
- **Question Type**: Categorical
- **Information Needs**: Categorization of the galaxies M101 and NGC 6365
- **Data Sources**: Text context and structured data
- **Reasoning Path**: Combine information from text context and structured data to provide the categorization
- The text context is from a section titled "Spiral galaxies with one heavy arm" in the "Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies." This suggests a focus on peculiar spiral galaxies, but specific details about M101 and NGC 6365 are not provided in the text context.
- **M101**: Described as a "Face-on spiral galaxy with five notable companion galaxies."
- **NGC 6365**: Described as an "Interacting pair of galaxies, with one galaxy viewed edge-on."
- **Text Primary**: The text context does not provide specific details about M101 and NGC 6365.
- **Data Support**: The structured data provides clear categorizations and descriptions.
- **Consistency Check**: The structured data is consistent with the need for categorization.
- **Complete Picture**: The structured data alone provides the necessary information for a complete answer.
- **M101** is categorized as a "Face-on spiral galaxy."
- **NGC 6365** is categorized as an "Interacting pair of galaxies."
- **M101** is categorized as a "Face-on spiral galaxy."
- **NGC 6365** is categorized as an "Interacting pair of galaxies."
