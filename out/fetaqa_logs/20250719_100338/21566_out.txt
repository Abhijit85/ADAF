=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Which channels was WNYJ-TV transmitted on when the station was multiplexed?

**Factual Answer**: WNYJ-TV was transmitted on channels 66.1, 66.2, and 66.6 when the station was multiplexed.

**Source**: Combined analysis from structured data and text context.

**Confidence**: High, based on the alignment and confirmation from both text context and structured data.

Answer Echoes:
- **Question Type**: Factual
- **Information Needs**: Specific channels on which WNYJ-TV was transmitted when multiplexed
- **Data Sources**: Text context from Wikipedia and structured data table
- **Reasoning Path**: Combine information from text and structured data to provide a comprehensive answer
- **Supporting Facts**: The structured data explicitly lists the channels 66.1, 66.2, and 66.6 as those on which WNYJ-TV was transmitted when multiplexed.
- **Text Primary**: The text context provides a section that likely discusses the digital channels of WNYJ-TV.
- **Data Support**: The structured data confirms the specific channels (66.1, 66.2, and 66.6).
- **Consistency Check**: Both sources align in identifying the channels.
- **Complete Picture**: Combine the information to provide a clear and accurate answer.
