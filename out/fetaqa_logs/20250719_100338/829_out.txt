- The ship "Canadian Star" from the United Kingdom was also sunk by U-221 on 18 March 1943.
- **Question Type**: Factual, temporal
- **Information Needs**: Identify which ships from the HX 229 convoy were sunk by U-221 and the dates of these incidents.
- **Data Sources**: Text context from the Wikipedia page and structured data analysis.
- **Reasoning Path**: Combine information from the text and structured data to provide a complete answer.
- The structured data clearly lists the ships "William Q Gresham" and "Canadian Star" as being sunk by U-221 on 18 March 1943.
- **Text Primary**: The text context provides background but lacks specific details on the ships sunk by U-221.
- **Data Support**: The structured data provides the necessary specifics about the ships and dates.
- **Consistency Check**: Information aligns across the structured data and the task requirements.
- **Complete Picture**: The structured data fills in the gaps left by the text context.
