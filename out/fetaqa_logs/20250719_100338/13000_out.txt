=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What's the destructive power of the 458 Winchester Magnum?

**Factual Answer**: The destructive power of the .458 Winchester Magnum is primarily measured by its muzzle energy, which is a key indicator of the cartridge's ability to deliver force upon impact. For the Winchester S458WSLSP and Winchester S458WSLS ammunition types, the muzzle energy is 5570 foot-pounds force (ft⋅lbf), equivalent to 7550 joules (J). This high level of energy makes the .458 Winchester Magnum a powerful cartridge, suitable for big game hunting and capable of delivering significant impact.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context and structured data.

**Confidence**: High
