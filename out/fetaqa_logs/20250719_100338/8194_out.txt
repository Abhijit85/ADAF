=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: For how much gross register tons (GRT) did the German submarine U-409 sink and/or damage?

**Factual Answer**: The German submarine U-409 sank and/or damaged a total of 32490 gross register tons (GRT). This total includes the following ships: "Bullmouth" (Damaged: 7519 GRT), "Silverwillow" (Sunk: 6373 GRT), "Malantic" (Sunk: 3837 GRT), "Rosewood" (Sunk: 5989 GRT), "City of Venice" (Sunk: 8762 GRT), and "HMS LCE-14" (Sunk: 10 GRT).

**Source**: Structured data

**Confidence**: High, as the structured data provides a clear and complete breakdown of the tonnage and fate of each ship, allowing for an accurate summation of the total GRT affected by U-409.

Answer Echoes:
- "Bullmouth" (Damaged): 7,519 GRT
- "Silverwillow" (Sunk): 6,373 GRT
- "Malantic" (Sunk): 3,837 GRT
- "Rosewood" (Sunk): 5,989 GRT
- "City of Venice" (Sunk): 8,762 GRT
- "HMS LCE-14" (Sunk): 10 GRT
