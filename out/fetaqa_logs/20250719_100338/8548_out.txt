=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What are the two most recent projects?

**Factual Answer**: The two most recent projects are the "Towed Glider Air-Launch Concept" from 2013 and the "Conroy Virtus" from 1974.

**Source**: Structured data table

**Confidence**: High

Answer Echoes:
- The "Status" column indicates whether an entry is a project, prototype, production, or other status.
- The "Date" column provides the year associated with each entry.
- **Question Type**: Temporal, factual
- **Information Needs**: Identify the two most recent aircraft projects based on the provided data.
- **Data Sources**: Structured data table
- **Reasoning Path**: Focus on entries with the status "Project" and identify the latest dates.
- **Supporting Facts**: The table provides information about various aircraft, including their status and date.
- **Organized Information**: The "Status" column indicates the type of entry (e.g., Project, Prototype), and the "Date" column provides the year.
- **Data Support**: The structured data table indicates the two most recent projects as:
