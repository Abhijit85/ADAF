=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: How much does the USS Rasher and USS Archerfish weigh respectively?

**Factual Answer**: The USS Rasher weighs 99901 tons, and the USS Archerfish weighs 59800 tons.

**Source**: Structured data

**Confidence**: High

The structured data provides clear and specific figures for the tonnage of each submarine, which is interpreted as their weight in this context.

Answer Echoes:
- **USS Rasher**: The table shows that the USS Rasher is a Gato-class submarine with a total tonnage of 99,901.
- **USS Archerfish**: The table shows that the USS Archerfish is a Balao-class submarine with a total tonnage of 59,800.
- The USS Rasher weighs 99,901 tons.
- The USS Archerfish weighs 59,800 tons.
- **Question Type**: Factual
- **Information Needs**: The weights of the USS Rasher and USS Archerfish
- **Data Sources**: Structured data table
- **Reasoning Path**: Extract and confirm weight information from structured data
- The text context does not provide specific weight information for the submarines, but it does indicate a focus on their success in terms of tonnage.
- **USS Rasher**: Gato-class submarine with a total tonnage of 99,901.
- **USS Archerfish**: Balao-class submarine with a total tonnage of 59,800.
- **Text Primary**: The text context does not directly provide the weights but sets the context for their success.
- **Data Support**: The structured data provides the exact tonnage figures.
- **Consistency Check**: The information aligns with the structured data.
- **Complete Picture**: The tonnage figures are used to answer the question about weight.
