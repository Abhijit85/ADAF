**Source**: Structured data

**Confidence**: High

The answer is based on the structured data, which clearly lists the aircraft types and their service status. The Airbus A320-200 and Airbus A321-200 are confirmed to be in service, while the Airbus A321neo is on order but not yet in service.

Answer Echoes:
- Airbus A320-200
- Airbus A321-200
- **Question Type**: Factual
- **Information Needs**: Types of planes currently in service at Nile Air
- **Data Sources**: Structured data table from the fleet section
- **Reasoning Path**: Use structured data to identify aircraft types in service
- The text context provides the section title and source but does not contain specific details about the aircraft types in service.
- The structured data table lists aircraft types and their service status:
- **Airbus A320-200**: 5 aircraft currently in service.
- **Airbus A321-200**: 2 aircraft currently in service.
- **Airbus A321neo**: 2 aircraft on order, none in service.
- **Text Primary**: Not applicable as the text context does not provide specific aircraft details.
- **Data Support**: Structured data confirms the types and number of aircraft in service.
- **Consistency Check**: Information aligns with structured data.
- **Complete Picture**: The structured data provides a comprehensive list of aircraft in service.
- Airbus A320-200
- Airbus A321-200
