=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Who won the 1987 general election?

**Factual Answer**: The winner of the 1987 general election cannot be determined from the provided information. The data and text context available pertain to the 1986 election, not the 1987 election.

**Source**: The provided information is based on the 1986 election results, which are not applicable to the 1987 election.

**Confidence**: Low, due to the lack of relevant data for the 1987 election.

Answer Echoes:

- **Information Needs**: Identify the winner of the 1987 general election
- **Data Sources**: Text context and structured data

- The structured data analysis mentions the results of a general election where the Democrat Party received the highest number of votes and won 100 seats with a seat change of +44. However, this data is about the 1986 election, not the 1987 election.
- **Text Primary**: The text context does not provide information about the 1987 election.
- **Data Support**: The structured data only supports the 1986 election results.
