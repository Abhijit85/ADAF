2. **International Diversity**:
   - Ratio of international to domestic staff with a weighting of 3%.
   - Ratio of international to domestic students with a weighting of 2%.

3. **Teaching – the learning environment**:
   - Reputational survey (teaching) with a weighting of 15%.
   - PhDs awards per academic with a weighting of 6%.
   - Undergraduates admitted per academic with a weighting of 4.5%.
   - Income per academic with a weighting of 2.25%.
   - PhDs/undergraduate degrees awarded with a weighting of 2.25%.

4. **Research – volume, income and reputation**:
   - Reputational survey (research) with a weighting of 19.5%.
   - Research income (scaled) with a weighting of 5.25%.
   - Papers per research and academic staff with a weighting of 4.5%.
   - Public research income/total research income with a weighting of 0.75%.

5. **Citations – research influence**:
   - Citation impact (normalized average citation per paper) with a weighting of 32.5%.
