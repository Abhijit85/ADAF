=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: How do the Super Bowl VII teams compare in terms of first downs and total net yards?

**Factual Answer**:
In Super Bowl VII, the Washington Redskins achieved more first downs (16) compared to the Miami Dolphins (12). However, the Miami Dolphins had more total net yards (253) than the Washington Redskins (228). This indicates that while the Redskins were more effective in advancing the ball incrementally (more first downs), the Dolphins were more efficient in terms of total yardage gained.

**Source**: Combined (Text + Data)
**Confidence**: High

**Synthesis Notes**:
- The answer integrates both the structured data (first downs and net yards) and the contextual explanation from the text analysis.
- The comparison is clear, logically consistent, and directly addresses the question.
- No conflicting information was found across sources, ensuring high confidence in the answer.

Answer Echoes:
- **First downs**: Miami Dolphins (12), Washington Redskins (16)
- **Total net yards**: Miami Dolphins (253), Washington Redskins (228)
- **First downs**: Miami Dolphins (12), Washington Redskins (16)
- **Total net yards**: Miami Dolphins (253), Washington Redskins (228)
