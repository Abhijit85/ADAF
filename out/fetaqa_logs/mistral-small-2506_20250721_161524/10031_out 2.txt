=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What roles did Roger Bart play in films from 2004-2005?

**Factual Answer**:
From 2004 to 2005, Roger Bart played the following roles in films:
- **2004**: Roger Bannister in *The Stepford Wives* (remake of the 1975 film).
- **2005**: Carmen Ghia in *The Producers* (based on the 1968 musical).

**Source**: Combined (text and structured data)
**Confidence**: High

**Rationale**:
- The answer integrates both the structured data table (which explicitly lists the roles and years) and the text context (which provides additional narrative details like "remake" and "based on the 1968 musical").
- Both sources confirm the same roles and years, ensuring high confidence in the accuracy of the answer.
- The synthesis follows the multimodal integration strategy by combining precise data with contextual text for completeness.

Answer Echoes:
- In 2004: "Roger Bannister" in *The Stepford Wives* (remake of the 1975 film).
- In 2005: "Carmen Ghia" in *The Producers* (based on the 1968 musical).
- **2004**: Roger Bart played "Roger Bannister" in *The Stepford Wives* (remake).
- **2005**: Roger Bart played "Carmen Ghia" in *The Producers* (based on the 1968 musical).
- **2004**: Roger Bannister in *The Stepford Wives* (remake).
- **2005**: Carmen Ghia in *The Producers*.
---
- Text analysis and data support are clearly separated.
- The answer is concise, accurate, and integrates both sources.
- Confidence is justified by source alignment.
