=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Have any of the world's twelve largest artificial islands been used for airports?

**Factual Answer**: Yes, three of the world's twelve largest artificial islands have been used for airports: Kansai International Airport (Japan, built in 1994), Hong Kong International Airport (Hong Kong, built in 1998), and Chūbu Centrair International Airport (Japan, built in 2005). These airports are built on reclaimed land and are among the largest artificial islands globally.

**Source**: Combined (Text + Structured Data)
**Confidence**: High

**Synthesis Notes**:
- The structured data table explicitly lists these three airports as the largest artificial islands used for aviation purposes.
- The text context from Wikipedia's "Artificial island" page supports the existence of such a list, reinforcing the data's reliability.
- No conflicting information was found, and the answer is complete, clear, and directly addresses the question.

**Final Answer**:
Yes, three of the world's twelve largest artificial islands have been used for airports: Kansai International Airport (Japan, 1994), Hong Kong International Airport (Hong Kong, 1998), and Chūbu Centrair International Airport (Japan, 2005). These are among the largest artificial islands globally and serve as major aviation hubs.

Answer Echoes:
- **Kansai International Airport** (Japan, built in 1994)
- **Hong Kong International Airport** (Hong Kong, built in 1998)
- **Chūbu Centrair International Airport** (Japan, built in 2005)
