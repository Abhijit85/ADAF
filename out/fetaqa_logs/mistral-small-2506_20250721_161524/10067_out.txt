=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: For what roles has Derek Jacobi been awarded the Laurence Olivier Award?

**Factual Answer**: Derek Jacobi has won the **Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor** for his role as **Malvolio** in *Twelfth Night* (2009). No other Olivier Awards for theatrical roles are documented in the provided sources.

**Source**: Combined (Text + Structured Data)
**Confidence**: High

---
**Synthesis Notes**:
1. **Consistency**: Both TabuSynth (structured data) and Contextron (text + data) confirm the 2009 Olivier Award for *Twelfth Night*.
2. **Completeness**: The structured data explicitly lists only one Olivier Award win (2009), while the text context does not contradict this.
3. **Relevance**: The answer directly addresses the question by naming the role and production for which Jacobi won the award.
4. **Clarity**: The response is concise and avoids speculation about other potential awards not mentioned in the sources.

**Missing Information**: If Jacobi has won additional Olivier Awards beyond the 2009 win, they are not captured in the provided data or text. However, the question is fully answered based on available evidence.

Answer Echoes:
- In 2000, Derek Jacobi played "Ivan Petrovich Voinitsky" in *Uncle Vanya* and was nominated for a Drama Desk Award but did not win a Laurence Olivier Award for this role.
- In 2009, Derek Jacobi played "Malvolio" in *Twelfth Night* and won the "Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor" for this role.
- If additional Olivier Awards exist beyond the provided data, they are not captured here.
- The text does not mention other potential awards or roles beyond the highlighted years (2000 and 2009).

                       '1. **Consistency**: Both TabuSynth (structured data) '
                       'and Contextron (text + data) confirm the 2009 Olivier '
                       'Award for *Twelfth Night*.\n'
                       '2. **Completeness**: The structured data explicitly '
                       'lists only one Olivier Award win (2009), while the '
                       'text context does not contradict this.\n'
                       '3. **Relevance**: The answer directly addresses the '
                       'question by naming the role and production for which '
                       'Jacobi won the award.\n'
                       '4. **Clarity**: The response is concise and avoids '
                       'speculation about other potential awards not mentioned '
                       'in the sources.\n'

                       '**Missing Information**: If Jacobi has won additional '
                       'Olivier Awards beyond the 2009 win, they are not '
                       'captured in the provided data or text. However, the '
                       'question is fully answered based on available '
