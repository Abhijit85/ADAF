Answer Echoes:
- **What were the pro-forma adjustments mainly comprised of?**
- **Answer**: Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs.
- **What were the net sales in 2019?**
- **Answer**: $5,563.7 million
- **Which years does the table provide information for the unaudited pro-forma consolidated results of operations?**
- **Answer**: 2018 and 2019
- **What was the change in the Basic net income per common share between 2018 and 2019?**
- **Calculation**: $2.29 (2019) - $(3.27) (2018) = $2.29 + $3.27 = $5.56
- **Answer**: $5.56 increase
- **What was the percentage change in net sales between 2018 and 2019?**
- **Calculation**: \((\frac{5,563.7 - 5,875.0}{5,875.0}) \times 100 = \left(\frac{-311.3}{5,875.0}\right) \times 100 \approx -5.30\%\)
- **Answer**: -5.30% decrease
- **What was the percentage change in Net income between 2018 and 2019?**
- **Calculation**: \((\frac{542.0 - (-762.3)}{-762.3}) \times 100 = \left(\frac{542.0 + 762.3}{762.3}\right) \times 100 \approx 171.08\%\)
- **Answer**: 171.08% increase
