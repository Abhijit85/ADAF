- **What results in deferred income taxes?**  
  Deferred income taxes result from differences between the book value and tax value of assets and liabilities. In this table, components contributing to deferred tax assets include accrued liabilities and reserves, tax loss and credit carryforwards, inventories, intangible assets, pension and postretirement benefits, deferred revenue, interest, unrecognized income tax benefits, basis difference in subsidiaries, and other items. Deferred tax liabilities arise from intangible assets, property, plant, and equipment, and other items.

- **What is the amount of net deferred tax assets in 2019?**  
  $2620 million

- **What are the components under deferred tax liabilities in the table?**  
  Intangible assets, property, plant, and equipment, and other.

- **In which year were Inventories larger?**  
  2018
