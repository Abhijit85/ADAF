- **Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs**
- **What is the value of the assumed liabilities from Automated?**
- **Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs**
- **What is the revised Total liabilities as of December 31, 2019?**
- $100.1 million
- **What is the percentage difference of total liabilities when comparing after adjustment to before adjustment?**
- Calculation:
- Before adjustment: $94.9 million
- After adjustment: $100.1 million
- Percentage difference = \(\frac{100.1 - 94.9}{94.9} \times 100\% = \frac{5.2}{94.9} \times 100\% \approx 5.48\%\)
- **Answer**: 5.48% increase
- **What is the total equity of the acquisition as of December 31, 2019?**
- Calculation:
- Total assets as of December 31, 2019: $545.8 million
- Total liabilities as of December 31, 2019: $100.1 million
- Total equity = Total assets - Total liabilities = $545.8 million - $100.1 million = $445.7 million
- **Answer**: $445.7 million
- **What is the liability to asset ratio as of December 31, 2019?**
- Calculation:
- Total liabilities as of December 31, 2019: $100.1 million
- Total assets as of December 31, 2019: $545.8 million
- Liability to asset ratio = \(\frac{100.1}{545.8} \approx 0.1834\)
- **Answer**: 0.1834 (or 18.34%)
