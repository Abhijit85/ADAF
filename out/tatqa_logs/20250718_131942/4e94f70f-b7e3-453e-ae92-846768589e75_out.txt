- **Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs**
- **How much did Hotels sales increased by in F19?**
- **Answer**: "Sales increased by 3.7% in F19."
- **What is the average sales for years F19 and F18?**
- **Calculation**:
- F19 Sales = $1,671 million
- F18 Sales = $1,612 million
- Average Sales = (1,671 + 1,612) / 2 = 1,641.5
- **Answer**: "$1,641.5 million"
- **What is the nominal difference in EBITDA between F19 and F18?**
- **Calculation**:
- F19 EBITDA = $372 million
- F18 EBITDA = $361 million
- Difference = 372 - 361 = 11
- **Answer**: "$11 million"
- **What is the percentage constitution of Depreciation and Amortisation in EBITDA in F19?**
- **Calculation**:
- Depreciation and Amortisation in F19 = $111 million
