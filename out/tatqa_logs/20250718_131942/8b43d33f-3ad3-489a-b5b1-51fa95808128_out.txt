=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

- **What is the amount of unrealized losses from restricted investments at the end of 2018?**  
  $6671

- **What was the reason for the unrealized losses in 2018?**  
  The unrealized losses were primarily due to increases in interest rates relative to rates at the time of purchase.

- **What is the plan for the losing investments?**  
  Based on the underlying credit quality of the investments, we generally hold such securities until we recover our cost basis. Therefore, we did not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired.

- **What is the difference between the total fair value amount and total amortized amount at 2018?**  
  $7979

- **What percentage of the total unrealized gain is generated from U.S. government obligations in 2018?**  
  2.84%

- **What percentage of the total amortized cost is made up of foreign government obligations in 2018?**  
  43.17%

Answer Echoes:
- **What is the amount of unrealized losses from restricted investments at the end of 2018?**
- **Answer**: $6,671
- **What was the reason for the unrealized losses in 2018?**
- **Answer**: Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs
- **What is the plan for the losing investments?**
- **Answer**: Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs
- **What is the difference between the total fair value amount and total amortized amount at 2018?**
- **Calculation**: Total Amortized Cost (2018) = $171,021, Total Fair Value (2018) = $179,000
- **Difference**: $179,000 - $171,021 = $7,979
- **Answer**: $7,979
- **What percentage of the total unrealized gain is generated from U.S. government obligations in 2018?**
- **Calculation**: Total Unrealized Gains (2018) = $14,650, U.S. Government Obligations Unrealized Gains (2018) = $416
- **Percentage**: ($416 / $14,650) * 100 ≈ 2.84%
- **Answer**: 2.84%
- **What percentage of the total amortized cost is made up of foreign government obligations in 2018?**
- **Calculation**: Total Amortized Cost (2018) = $171,021, Foreign Government Obligations Amortized Cost (2018) = $73,798
- **Percentage**: ($73,798 / $171,021) * 100 ≈ 43.17%
- **Answer**: 43.17%
