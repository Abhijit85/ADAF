Answer Echoes:
- **How much was research, development and engineering expense associated with the legacy business of GP during the year ended December 31, 2019?**
- **Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs** (The table does not specify expenses associated with the legacy business of GP).
- **What is the average Selling, general and administrative expense for December 31, 2018 and 2019?**
- **Calculation**:
- 2019: $24,371,349
- 2018: $14,794,205
- Average = \((24,371,349 + 14,794,205) / 2 = 19,582,777\)
- **Answer**: "$19,582,777"
- **What is the average Research, development and engineering expense for December 31, 2018 and 2019?**
- **Calculation**:
- 2019: $7,496,012
- 2018: $3,766,160
- Average = \((7,496,012 + 3,766,160) / 2 = 5,631,086\)
- **Answer**: "$5,631,086"
- **In which year was Selling, general and administrative expense less than 20,000,000?**
- **2018**: $14,794,205
- **2019**: $24,371,349
- **Answer**: "2018"
- **What was the Total operating expense in 2019 and 2018?**
