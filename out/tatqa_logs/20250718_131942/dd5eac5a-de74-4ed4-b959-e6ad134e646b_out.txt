- **Answer**: Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs.
- **How will this acquisition benefit Proofpoint?**
- **Answer**: Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs.
- **How long is the estimated useful life for the Goodwill?**
- **Answer**: The estimated useful life for Goodwill is "Indefinite".
- **What is the difference in fair value between current assets and fixed assets?**
- **Extraction**:
- Current assets = $37,390
- Fixed assets = $543
- **Calculation**: $37,390 - $543 = $36,847
- **Answer**: "$36,847"
- **What is the average fair value of Order backlog?**
- **Extraction**:
- Order backlog fair value = $1,400
- **Answer**: "$1,400" (since only one value is provided, the average is the value itself)
- **What is the total fair value of all the liabilities assumed?**
- **Extraction**:
- Liabilities = $(4,422)
- Deferred revenue = $(15,400)
- Deferred tax liability, net = $(7,905)
- **Calculation**: $(4,422) + $(15,400) + $(7,905) = $(27,727)
- **Answer**: "$27,727" (negative value indicates liabilities)
