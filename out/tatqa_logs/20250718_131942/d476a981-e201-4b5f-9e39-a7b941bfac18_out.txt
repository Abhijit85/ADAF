Answer Echoes:
- **What are the respective values of raw materials in 2018 and 2019?**
- 2018: $191,000
- 2019: $222,000
- **What are the respective values of work-in-process inventory in 2018 and 2019?**
- 2018: $2,929,000
- 2019: $2,370,000
- **What are the respective values of finished goods in 2018 and 2019?**
- 2018: $716,000
- 2019: $668,000
- **What is the percentage change in the value of raw materials between 2018 and 2019?**
- Calculation: \(\frac{222 - 191}{191} \times 100 = \frac{31}{191} \times 100 \approx 16.23\%\)
- Answer: 16.23% increase
- **What is the percentage change in the value of work-in-process inventory between 2018 and 2019?**
- Calculation: \(\frac{2,370 - 2,929}{2,929} \times 100 = \frac{-559}{2,929} \times 100 \approx -19.08\%\)
- Answer: 19.08% decrease
- **What is the percentage change in the value of finished goods between 2018 and 2019?**
- Calculation: \(\frac{668 - 716}{716} \times 100 = \frac{-48}{716} \times 100 \approx -6.70\%\)
- Answer: 6.70% decrease
