Answer Echoes:
- **What was the amount of depreciation expense in 2019?**
- **Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs.**
- The table provides accumulated depreciation values but not the depreciation expense for the year.
- **In which years was the Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net calculated for?**
- **Answer**: "2019, 2018"
- **What were the components under Property, plant, and equipment, gross?**
- **Answer**:
- "Land and improvements"
- "Buildings and improvements"
- "Machinery and equipment"
- "Construction in process"
- **In which year was the amount of Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net larger?**
- **Extraction**:
- 2019: $3,574 million
- 2018: $3,497 million
- **Comparison**: 3,574 > 3,497
- **Answer**: "2019"
- **What was the change in Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net in 2019 from 2018?**
- **Extraction**:
- 2019: $3,574 million
- 2018: $3,497 million
- **Calculation**: 3,574 - 3,497 = 77
- **Answer**: "$77 million increase"
- **What was the percentage change in Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net in 2019 from 2018?**
- **Extraction**:
- 2019: $3,574 million
- 2018: $3,497 million
- **Calculation**: ((3,574 - 3,497) / 3,497) * 100 = (77 / 3,497) * 100 ≈ 2.20%
