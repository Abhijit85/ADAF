- **Answer**: Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs
- **What is the company's five step approach?**
- **Answer**: Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs
- **What is excluded when calculating revenue?**
- **Answer**: Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs
- **What is the total deferred revenue at the end of the period?**
- **Calculation**:
- Deferred revenue (current) at end of period = $4,483
- Deferred revenue (non-current) at end of period = $3,444
- Total deferred revenue = $4,483 + $3,444 = $7,927
- **Answer**: $7,927
- **What is the ratio of current deferred revenue to non-current deferred revenue as of end of period?**
- **Calculation**:
- Current deferred revenue = $4,483
- Non-current deferred revenue = $3,444
- Ratio = $4,483 / $3,444 ≈ 1.30
- **Answer**: 1.30
- **What is the total accounts receivables at end of period for year 2018 and 2019?**
- **2019**: Accounts receivable at end of period = $97,948
- **2018**: Unable to determine from the table as it only provides data for 2019
- **Answer**: 2019: $97,948; 2018: Unable to determine from table
