- **How often does the company review their internal calculation of WACC?**
- **Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs**
- **What was the average invested capital in 2018?**
- $735.6 million
- **What was the change in the Adjusted operating income (tax effected) between 2018 and 2019?**
- 2019: $120.7 million
- 2018: $118.6 million
- Change: $120.7 million - $118.6 million = $2.1 million increase
- **What was the percentage change in the WACC between 2018 and 2019?**
- 2019: 9.0%
- 2018: 9.5%
- Percentage change: ((9.0 - 9.5) / 9.5) * 100 = -5.26% decrease
- **What was the percentage change in the Average invested capital between 2018 and 2019?**
- 2019: $923.1 million
- 2018: $735.6 million
- Percentage change: ((923.1 - 735.6) / 735.6) * 100 = 25.50% increase
