Answer Echoes:
- **What was the bad debt expense in 2019?**
- The bad debt expense in 2019 was $(1.6).
- **What was the ending balance in 2017?**
- The ending balance in 2017 was $(1.9).
- **Which years does the table provide information for the rollforward of allowance for doubtful accounts?**
- The table provides information for the years 2017, 2018, and 2019.
- **What was the change in Write-offs, net of recoveries between 2018 and 2019?**
- Write-offs, net of recoveries in 2018: 1.2
- Write-offs, net of recoveries in 2019: 1.6
- Change: 1.6 - 1.2 = 0.4
- **What was the change in beginning balance between 2017 and 2018?**
- Beginning balance in 2017: $(2.2)
- Beginning balance in 2018: $(1.9)
