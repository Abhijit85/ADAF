Answer Echoes:
- **How much was the average operating income from 2015 to 2019?**
- Extracted Values:
- 2019: $13,535 million
- 2018: $13,264 million
- 2017: $12,913 million
- 2016: $12,604 million
- 2015: $13,871 million
- Calculation:
- Average = (13,535 + 13,264 + 12,913 + 12,604 + 13,871) / 5
- Average = $13,237.4 million
- **Answer**: $13,237.4 million
- **What was the total expenses for Oracle in 2018?**
- Total Revenues (2018): $39,383 million
