Answer Echoes:
- **Which years does the table show?**
- 2018, 2019
- **What was the servicing related net accounts receivable in 2019?**
- $6,868 thousand
- **What was the total Allowance for Losses in 2018?**
- $(168) thousand
- **How many years did the total net Accounts Receivable exceed $15,000 thousand?**
- 1 year (2019)
- **What was the change in the total gross accounts receivable between 2018 and 2019?**
- Calculation: $19,731 thousand (2019) - $15,568 thousand (2018) = $4,163 thousand
- Answer: $4,163 thousand increase
- **What was the percentage change in the total allowance for losses between 2018 and 2019?**
- Calculation:
- 2018 Allowance for Losses = $(168) thousand
- 2019 Allowance for Losses = $(238) thousand
- Change = $(238) - $(168) = $(70) thousand
- Percentage Change = ($(70) / $(168)) * 100 = 41.67%
