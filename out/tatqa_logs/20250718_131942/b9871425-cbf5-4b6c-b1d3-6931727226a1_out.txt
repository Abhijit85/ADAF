- **What does the table represent?**
- The table represents the carrying amounts and fair values of various debt instruments as of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018. It includes details about different types of loans and senior notes, along with their respective due dates.
- **What is the fair value of total debt as of December 31, 2019?**

- Percentage = (89.0 / 4,073.9) * 100 = 2.18%
- **What is the percentage difference between fair value and carrying amount of total debt as of December 31, 2018?**
- Carrying amount = $3,474.2 million
- Fair value = $3,535.1 million
- Percentage difference = ((3,535.1 - 3,474.2) / 3,474.2) * 100 = 1.75%
