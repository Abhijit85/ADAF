  "Scope 1: Combustion of fuel and operation of facilities; Scope 2: Electricity, heat, steam and cooling purchased for own use"

- **In which year were the Scope 1 emissions larger?**  
  "2019"

- **What was the change in total emissions?**

  "-5.93%"

Answer Echoes:
- **What is the percentage change in the total amount of emissions from Combustion of fuel and operation of facilities and Electricity, heat, steam and cooling purchased for own use?**
- **Calculation**:
- 2019 Total = 144.7 (Scope 1) + 4,641.0 (Scope 2) = 4,785.7 Tonnes of CO2e
- 2018 Total = 137.2 (Scope 1) + 4,950.4 (Scope 2) = 5,087.6 Tonnes of CO2e
- Percentage Change = ((4,785.7 - 5,087.6) / 5,087.6) * 100 = -5.93%
- **Answer**: "-5.93%"
- **By how much has Spirent reduced their total emissions since their 2014 baseline?**
- **Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs** (The table does not provide data for the 2014 baseline).
- **What are the scopes of emissions?**
- **Extraction**:
- Scope 1: Combustion of fuel and operation of facilities
- Scope 2: Electricity, heat, steam and cooling purchased for own use
- **Answer**: "Scope 1: Combustion of fuel and operation of facilities; Scope 2: Electricity, heat, steam and cooling purchased for own use"
- **In which year were the Scope 1 emissions larger?**
- **Comparison**:
- 2019 Scope 1 = 144.7 Tonnes of CO2e
- 2018 Scope 1 = 137.2 Tonnes of CO2e
- 144.7 > 137.2
- **Answer**: "2019"
- **What was the change in total emissions?**
- **Calculation**:
- Change = 4,785.7 (2019) - 5,087.6 (2018) = -301.9 Tonnes of CO2e
- **Answer**: "-301.9 Tonnes of CO2e"
- **What was the percentage change in total emissions?**
- **Calculation**:
- Percentage Change = ((4,785.7 - 5,087.6) / 5,087.6) * 100 = -5.93%
- **Answer**: "-5.93%"
