- **Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs**
- **What was the fair value of trademarks and tradenames?**
- $25
- **What were the total definite-lived intangible assets?**
- $492
- **What was fair value amount of Other intangible assets as a percentage of total intangible assets acquired?**
- Calculation: \((\frac{20}{492}) \times 100 = 4.07\%\)
- **Answer**: 4.07%
