Answer Echoes:
- **What are the years included under the statement of cash flows table?**
- 2019, 2018, 2017
- **How much is the cash provided by operating activities in 2019?**
- $(426)
- **How much is the cash provided by financing activities in 2019?**
- $5,798
- **What is the percentage change in cash provided by financing activities between 2018 and 2019?**
- Calculation:
- 2018: $3,624
- 2019: $5,798
- Percentage Change = \(\frac{5,798 - 3,624}{3,624} \times 100\)
- Percentage Change = \(\frac{2,174}{3,624} \times 100 \approx 59.98\%\)
- Answer: 59.98%
- **What is the total cash provided by financing activities between 2017 to 2019?**
- Calculation:
- 2017: $8,420
- 2018: $3,624
- 2019: $5,798
- Total = $8,420 + $3,624 + $5,798 = $17,842
- Answer: $17,842
- **What is the total cash provided by all cash flow related activities between 2017 to 2019?**
- Calculation:
- 2017: Operating: $14,314, Investing: $(5,142), Financing: $8,420
- Total 2017 = $14,314 - $5,142 + $8,420 = $17,592
- 2018: Operating: $(2,694), Investing: $(6,876), Financing: $3,624
- Total 2018 = $(2,694) - $6,876 + $3,624 = $(5,946)
- 2019: Operating: $(426), Investing: $(251), Financing: $5,798
- Total 2019 = $(426) - $251 + $5,798 = $5,121
- Total for 2017 to 2019 = $17,592 - $5,946 + $5,121 = $16,767
- Answer: $16,767
