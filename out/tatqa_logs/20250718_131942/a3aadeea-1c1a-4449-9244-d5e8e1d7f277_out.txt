- **What is the total special termination benefits charge in 2018 and 2019?**
- 2018: $15 million
- 2019: $6 million
- **Total Special Termination Benefits Charge**: $15 million + $6 million = $21 million
- **Which year has the lowest service cost?**
- 2017: $63 million
- 2018: $66 million
- 2019: $56 million
- **Answer**: 2019 has the lowest service cost at $56 million.
- **What is the percentage change in interest cost in 2019 from 2018?**
- 2018 Interest Cost: $392 million
- 2019 Interest Cost: $436 million
- **Calculation**: \(\frac{436 - 392}{392} \times 100 = \frac{44}{392} \times 100 \approx 11.22\%\)
- **Answer**: The percentage change in interest cost in 2019 from 2018 is approximately 11.22%.
