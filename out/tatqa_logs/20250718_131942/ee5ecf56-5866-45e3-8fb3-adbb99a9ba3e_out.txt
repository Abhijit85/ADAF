=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

- **What is Fair Value based on?**  
  Fair value is based on three levels of inputs: Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1), Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2), and Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3).

- **What is considered to be a cash equivalent?**  
  Money market funds are considered to be a cash equivalent, as they are typically highly liquid and short-term investments.

- **What does the Company's investments consist of?**  
  The company's investments consist of: Money market funds: $2010 (Level 2), U.S. treasury bonds: $116835 (Level 2), Commercial paper: $44300 (Level 2), Certificates of deposit: $24539 (Level 2), Asset-backed securities: $73499 (Level 2), Corporate debt securities: $181079 (Level 2).

- **What proportion of level 2 inputs is made up of money market funds?**  
  \( \frac{2010}{442262} \approx 0.45\% \)

- **Which component is the greatest in the total fair value?**  
  Corporate debt securities have the greatest total fair value at $181079.

- **What proportion of Total Fair Value is made up of level 2 inputs?**  
  \( \frac{442262}{442262} = 100\% \)
