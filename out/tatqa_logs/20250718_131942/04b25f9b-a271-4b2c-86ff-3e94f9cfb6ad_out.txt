- **Answer**: **Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs**
- **Answer**: **Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs**
- **Extraction**:
- 2019 Prepaid expenses and other = $2,578 million
- 2018 Prepaid expenses and other = $2,083 million
- **Calculation**: $2,578 million - $2,083 million = $495 million
- **Answer**: "$495 million increase"
- **Extraction**:
- 2019 Other assets = $1,911 million
- 2018 Other assets = $1,812 million
- **Calculation**: (1,911 + 1,812) / 2 = 1,861.5
- **Answer**: "$1,861.5 million"
- **Extraction**:
- 2019 Other assets = $1,911 million
- 2018 Other assets = $1,812 million
- **Calculation**: ((1,911 - 1,812) / 1,812) * 100 = 5.46%
