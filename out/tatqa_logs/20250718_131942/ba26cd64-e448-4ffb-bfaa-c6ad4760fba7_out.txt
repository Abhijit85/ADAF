=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

- **How does TORM define loan-to-value (LTV)?**  
  TORM defines Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio as Vessel values divided by net borrowings on the vessels.

- **What is the LTV used by TORM for?**  
  LTV is used by TORM to describe the financial situation, the liquidity risk, as well as to express the future possibilities to raise new capital by new loan facilities.

- **Which are the components in the table which are used to tabulate the Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio based on its definition?**  
  The components likely used to calculate the Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio are Total (loan) and Vessel values including newbuildings (broker values).

- **In which year was the LTV ratio the largest?**  
  The LTV ratio was the largest in 2017, with a value of 55.8%.

- **What was the change in Total (loan) in 2019 from 2018?**  
  The change in Total (loan) in 2019 from 2018 was -56.5 USDm.

- **What was the percentage change in Total (loan) in 2019 from 2018?**  
  The percentage change in Total (loan) in 2019 from 2018 was -6.38%.

- **What is the LTV used by TORM for?**
- Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs.
- **Which are the components in the table which are used to tabulate the Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio based on its definition?**
- The components likely used to calculate the Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio are:
- **Total (loan)**: Represents the total amount of loans.
- **Vessel values including newbuildings (broker values)**: Represents the total value of the vessels.
- **In which year was the LTV ratio the largest?**
- The LTV ratio was the largest in **2017**, with a value of **55.8%**.
- **What was the change in Total (loan) in 2019 from 2018?**
- **Calculation**: 2019 Total (loan) = 828.8 USDm, 2018 Total (loan) = 885.3 USDm
- **Change**: 828.8 - 885.3 = **-56.5 USDm**
- **What was the percentage change in Total (loan) in 2019 from 2018?**
- **Calculation**:
- Change = 828.8 - 885.3 = -56.5 USDm
- Percentage Change = (-56.5 / 885.3) * 100
- Percentage Change ≈ **-6.38%**
