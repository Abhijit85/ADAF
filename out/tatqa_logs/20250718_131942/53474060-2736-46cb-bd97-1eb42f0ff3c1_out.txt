- **In which years was the net sales by segment and industry end market calculated?**
- The net sales by segment and industry end market were calculated for the years 2017, 2018, and 2019.
- **What are the types of Solutions segments in the table?**
- The types of Solutions segments in the table are:
- Transportation Solutions
- Industrial Solutions
- Communications Solutions
- **In which year was the amount for Sensors the largest?**
- The amount for Sensors was the largest in the year 2018, with a value of $918 million.
- **What was the change in the amount for Appliances in 2019 from 2018?**
- The change in the amount for Appliances in 2019 from 2018 was a decrease of $94 million (from $774 million in 2018 to $680 million in 2019).
- **What was the percentage change in the amount for Appliances in 2019 from 2018?**
- The percentage change in the amount for Appliances in 2019 from 2018 is calculated as follows:
- Percentage change = [(680 - 774) / 774] * 100 = (-94 / 774) * 100 ≈ -12.15%
- The percentage change in the amount for Appliances in 2019 from 2018 was approximately -12.15%.
