Answer Echoes:
- **What were the sales contributed to Refrigerated & Frozen’s net sales through the acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin business for the fiscal year 2019?**
- **Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs** (The table does not specify the contribution from the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin business to the Refrigerated & Frozen segment.)
- **What was the net sales of the International and Foodservice segment respectively?**
- **International**: $793.4 million
- **Foodservice**: $934.2 million
- **What was the total net sales in fiscal year 2018?**
- **Total Net Sales in Fiscal Year 2018**: $7,938.3 million
- **What is the proportion (in percentage) of the sum of Grocery & Snacks and Refrigerated & Frozen’s net sales over total net sales in fiscal year 2018?**
- **Calculation**:
- Grocery & Snacks 2018: $3,287.0 million
- Refrigerated & Frozen 2018: $2,753.0 million
- Sum = $3,287.0 million + $2,753.0 million = $6,040.0 million
- Total 2018 Net Sales = $7,938.3 million
- Proportion = ($6,040.0 million / $7,938.3 million) * 100 = 76.1%
- **Answer**: 76.1%
- **What is the percentage change in total net sales of International and Foodservice from fiscal year 2018 to 2019?**
- **Calculation**:
- International 2018: $843.5 million, 2019: $793.4 million
- Foodservice 2018: $1,054.8 million, 2019: $934.2 million
- Total 2018 = $843.5 million + $1,054.8 million = $1,898.3 million
- Total 2019 = $793.4 million + $934.2 million = $1,727.6 million
- Change = $1,727.6 million - $1,898.3 million = -$170.7 million
- Percentage Change = (-$170.7 million / $1,898.3 million) * 100 = -8.99%
- **Answer**: -9.0% (rounded to one decimal place)
- **What is the change in total sales from fiscal 2018 to 2019?**
- **Calculation**:
- Total 2019 Net Sales = $9,538.4 million
- Total 2018 Net Sales = $7,938.3 million
- Change = $9,538.4 million - $7,938.3 million = $1,600.1 million
- **Answer**: $1,600.1 million increase
