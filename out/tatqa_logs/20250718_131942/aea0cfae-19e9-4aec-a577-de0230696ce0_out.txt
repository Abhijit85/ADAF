- **When is Goodwill considered impaired?**  
  - Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the cash-generating unit to which it relates is greater than the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use.

- **What are the regions in the table to which the carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated to before recognition of impairment losses?**  
  - "Americas", "EMEA", "APJ"

- **In which year was the amount in APJ larger?**  
  - "2018"

- **What was the change in the amount in APJ in 2019 from 2018?**  
  - "-$4.9M"

- **What was the percentage change in the amount in APJ in 2019 from 2018?**  
  - "-4.73%"

- **Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs**
- **What are the regions in the table to which the carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated to before recognition of impairment losses?**
- **Answer**: "Americas", "EMEA", "APJ"
- **In which year was the amount in APJ larger?**
- **Table Analysis**: Compare APJ values across years
- **Extraction**: APJ 2018 = $103.6M, APJ 2019 = $98.7M
- **Comparison**: 103.6 > 98.7
- **Answer**: "2018"
- **What was the change in the amount in APJ in 2019 from 2018?**
- **Table Analysis**: Find APJ values for both years
- **Extraction**: 2019 = $98.7M, 2018 = $103.6M
- **Calculation**: 98.7 - 103.6 = -4.9
- **Answer**: "-$4.9M"
- **What was the percentage change in the amount in APJ in 2019 from 2018?**
- **Table Analysis**: Use APJ values for both years
- **Extraction**: 2019 = $98.7M, 2018 = $103.6M
- **Calculation**: ((98.7 - 103.6) / 103.6) * 100 = -4.73%
- **Answer**: "-4.73%"
