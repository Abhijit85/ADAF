=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

- **What are the impacts of significant revisions in contract estimates?**  
  Significant revisions in contract estimates can materially affect our results of operations and cash flows, and in some cases result in liabilities to complete contracts in a loss position.

- **What could result in the 2019 operating income increasing or decreasing by approximately $6.5 million?**  
  If underlying assumptions were to change such that our estimated profit rate at completion for all fixed-price contracts accounted for under the cost-to-cost percentage-of-completion method was higher or lower by one percentage point, our 2019 operating income would have increased or decreased by approximately $6.5 million.

- **For which periods is the aggregate impact of net changes in contract estimates presented in the table?**  
  The aggregate impact of net changes in contract estimates is presented for the periods 2017, 2018, and 2019.

- **In which year is the diluted earnings per share the lowest?**  
  2018 (Diluted earnings per share: (0.19))

- **What is the change in operating income (loss) in 2019 from 2018?**  
  $4751 increase

- **What is the average operating income (loss) across 2017, 2018 and 2019?**  
  $ (1161.33)

- **For which periods is the aggregate impact of net changes in contract estimates presented in the table?**
- **Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs**
- **In which year is the diluted earnings per share the lowest?**
- **Answer**: 2018 (Diluted earnings per share: (0.19))
- **What is the change in operating income (loss) in 2019 from 2018?**
- **Calculation**: 2019 Operating Income (Loss) = $ (2,235), 2018 Operating Income (Loss) = $ (6,986)
- **Change**: $ (2,235) - $ (6,986) = $ 4,751
- **Answer**: $ 4,751 increase
- **What is the average operating income (loss) across 2017, 2018 and 2019?**
- **Calculation**: 2017 = $ 5,737, 2018 = $ (6,986), 2019 = $ (2,235)
- **Sum**: $ 5,737 + $ (6,986) + $ (2,235) = $ (3,484)
- **Average**: $ (3,484) / 3 = $ (1,161.33)
- **Answer**: $ (1,161.33)
