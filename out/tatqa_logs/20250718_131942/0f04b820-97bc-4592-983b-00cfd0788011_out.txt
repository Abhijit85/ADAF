Answer Echoes:
- **How much was the total energy consumption (MWh) for the year ended 31 December 2019?**
- 205,092.26 MWh
- **How much was the total energy consumption (MWh) for the year ended 31 December 2018?**
- 167,488.48 MWh
- **How much was the direct energy consumption (MWh) for the year ended 31 December 2019?**
- 19,144.17 MWh
- **What is the change between direct energy consumption (MWh) in 2018 and 2019 year end?**
- Calculation: 19,144.17 MWh (2019) - 12,852.04 MWh (2018) = 6,292.13 MWh
- Answer: 6,292.13 MWh increase
- **What is the change between indirect energy consumption (MWh) in 2018 and 2019 year end?**
- Calculation: 185,948.09 MWh (2019) - 154,636.44 MWh (2018) = 31,311.65 MWh
- Answer: 31,311.65 MWh increase
- **What is the change between running water consumption (tonnes) in 2018 and 2019 year end?**
- Calculation: 1,283,749.73 tonnes (2019) - 973,413.06 tonnes (2018) = 310,336.67 tonnes
- Answer: 310,336.67 tonnes increase
