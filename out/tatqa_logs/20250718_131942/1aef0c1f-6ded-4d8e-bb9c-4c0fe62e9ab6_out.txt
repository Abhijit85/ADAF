- **Answer**: Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs
- **What was the respective cost of revenue in 2019, 2018 and 2017?**
- **2019**: $2,936
- **2018**: $3,869
- **2017**: $3,189
- **In which year was Research and development less than 10,000 thousands?**
- **Answer**: 2017 (Research and development was 10,565 in 2017, which is more than 10,000)
- **What was the average cost of revenue for 2017-2019?**
- **Calculation**:
- Sum of cost of revenue for 2017-2019 = $2,936 + $3,869 + $3,189 = $9,994
- Average = $9,994 / 3 = $3,331.33
