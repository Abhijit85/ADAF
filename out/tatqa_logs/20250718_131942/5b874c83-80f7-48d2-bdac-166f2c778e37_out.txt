Answer Echoes:
- **Why did Interest expense decrease in the year ended December 31, 2018, versus the same period in 2017?**
- **Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs**. The table provides the figures for interest expense but does not explain the reasons behind the decrease.
- **What was the interest expense in 2018?**
- **Answer**: $(2,085)
- **What was the Total other (expense) income, net in 2017?**
- **Answer**: $1,758
- **How many years did interest income exceed $1,500 thousand?**
- **Analysis**: Interest income in 2018 was $1,826, and in 2017 it was $1,284.
- **Answer**: 1 year (2018)
- **What was the change in interest expense between 2017 and 2018?**
- **Calculation**: 2018 interest expense = $(2,085), 2017 interest expense = $(3,343)
- **Change**: $(2,085) - $(3,343) = $1,258
- **Answer**: $1,258 decrease
- **What was the percentage change in the net Total other (expense) income between 2017 and 2018?**
- **Calculation**:
- 2017 Total other (expense) income, net = $1,758
- 2018 Total other (expense) income, net = $(2,935)
- Change = $(2,935) - $1,758 = $(4,693)
- Percentage change = ($(4,693) / $1,758) * 100 = -266.96%
- **Answer**: -266.96% decrease
