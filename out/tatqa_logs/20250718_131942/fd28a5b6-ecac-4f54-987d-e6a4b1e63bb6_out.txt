Answer Echoes:
- **What is the price per share for the final dividend for 2019?**
- **Answer**: Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs. The table provides the total amount paid for the final dividend but does not specify the number of shares outstanding to calculate the price per share.
- **What is total dividend based on the number of shares outstanding?**
- **Answer**: Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs. The table provides total dividend amounts but not the number of shares outstanding.
- **What are the years included in the table?**
- **Answer**: 2019, 2018
- **What is the percentage change in the total dividends paid from 2018 to 2019?**
- **Calculation**:
- Total dividends 2019 = 28,128 (US$’000)
- Total dividends 2018 = 25,633 (US$’000)
- Percentage change = ((28,128 - 25,633) / 25,633) * 100
- Percentage change = (2,495 / 25,633) * 100 ≈ 9.73%
- **Answer**: 9.73% increase
- **What is the percentage change in the final dividend from 2018 to 2019?**
- **Calculation**:
- Final dividend 2019 = 13,327 (US$’000)
- Final dividend 2018 = 12,534 (US$’000)
- Percentage change = ((13,327 - 12,534) / 12,534) * 100
- Percentage change = (793 / 12,534) * 100 ≈ 6.33%
- **Answer**: 6.33% increase
- **What is the percentage change in the interim dividend from 2018 to 2019?**
- **Calculation**:
- Interim dividend 2019 = 14,801 (US$’000)
- Interim dividend 2018 = 13,099 (US$’000)
- Percentage change = ((14,801 - 13,099) / 13,099) * 100
- Percentage change = (1,702 / 13,099) * 100 ≈ 12.99%
- **Answer**: 12.99% increase
