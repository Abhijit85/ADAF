- **What were the tax benefits realized by the company for year ended 31 December 2019?**
- **Answer**: Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs.
- **What is the increase / (decrease) in the RSUs Granted from 2018 to 2019?**
- **Extraction**: RSUs Granted in 2019 = $674 million, RSUs Granted in 2018 = $583 million
