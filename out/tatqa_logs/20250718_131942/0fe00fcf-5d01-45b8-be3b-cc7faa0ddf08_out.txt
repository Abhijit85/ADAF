- **What is the discount rate for 2019?**
- 2.5%
- **What is the average discount rate over the 3 year period from 2017 to 2019?**
- Calculation: (2.5% + 2.4% + 3.2%) / 3 = 2.7%
- Answer: 2.7%
- **How much did the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets decrease by from 2017 to 2019?**
- Calculation: 4.3% (2017) - 3.3% (2019) = 1.0%
- Answer: 1.0% decrease
- **What is the average discount rate over the 3 year period from 2017 to 2019?**
- Calculation: (2.5% + 2.4% + 3.2%) / 3 = 2.7%
