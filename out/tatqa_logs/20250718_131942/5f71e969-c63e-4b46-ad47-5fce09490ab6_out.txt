=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

- **What was the average orders for 2019 and 2018?**  
  €19213 million

- **What is the increase / (decrease) in revenue from 2018 to 2019?**  
  €462 million decrease

- **What is the increase / (decrease) in the Adjusted EBITDA margin from 2018 to 2019?**  
  0.2% decrease

- **What was the reason for the decline in the Adjusted EBITDA?**  
  Adjusted EBITA was down year-over-year due to lower revenue, price declines, and reduced capacity utilization. Additionally, fiscal 2018 benefited from gains totaling €166 million from two divestments, which did not recur in 2019.

- **What is the projection for the power generation market?**  
  The power generation market is expected to remain challenging, with market volume stabilizing at the current level.

- **What is the rationale for the projection for Oil and gas markets in 2020?**  
  The oil and gas markets are expected to grow in 2020, driven by the liquefied natural gas and upstream markets. Both offshore and onshore exploration markets are anticipated to recover further based on a growing number of expected project approvals.
