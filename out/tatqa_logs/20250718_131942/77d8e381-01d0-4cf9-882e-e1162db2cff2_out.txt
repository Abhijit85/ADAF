Answer Echoes:
- **What was the net profit/(loss) after tax in FY19?**

- **What was the underlying EBITDA in FY19?**
- The underlying EBITDA in FY19 was $85,123,000.
- **What was the percentage change in underlying EBITDA between 2018 and 2019?**
- The percentage change in underlying EBITDA between 2018 and 2019 was 36%.
- **Which FY has a higher EBITDA?**
- FY19 has a higher EBITDA with $79,046,000 compared to FY18's $63,954,000.
- **What was the average difference between EBITDA and underlying EBITDA for both FYs?**
- FY19: Underlying EBITDA ($85,123,000) - EBITDA ($79,046,000) = $6,077,000
- FY18: Underlying EBITDA ($62,575,000) - EBITDA ($63,954,000) = -$1,379,000
- Average difference = ($6,077,000 - $1,379,000) / 2 = $2,349,000
- **What was the difference in net profit between both FYs?**
- Net profit difference = FY19 net profit/(loss) ($-9,819,000) - FY18 net profit ($6,639,000) = $-16,458,000
