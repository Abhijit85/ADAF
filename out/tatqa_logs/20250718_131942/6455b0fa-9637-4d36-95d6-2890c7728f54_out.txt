Answer Echoes:
- **What was the service cost in 2019?**
- $1,955
- **What was the Interest cost in 2018?**
- $1,230
- **In which years was the amount of Interest cost calculated?**
- 2017, 2018, 2019
- **In which year was the amount of Interest cost largest?**
- 2019
- **What was the change in Recognized net actuarial (gain) loss in 2019 from 2018?**
- Calculation: 2019 value (470) - 2018 value (240) = 230
- Answer: 230
- **What was the percentage change in Recognized net actuarial (gain) loss in 2019 from 2018?**
- Calculation: ((2019 value - 2018 value) / 2018 value) * 100
- ((470 - 240) / 240) * 100 = 95.83%
- Answer: 95.83% increase
