Answer Echoes:
- **What are the respective net operating loss carry-forwards in 2018 and 2019?**
- 2018: $255,235
- 2019: $255,269
- **What are the respective tax credits in 2018 and 2019?**
- 2018: $2,458
- 2019: $2,261
- **What are the respective equity-based compensation in 2018 and 2019?**
- 2018: $3,322
- 2019: $4,116
- **What is the total net operating loss carry-forwards in 2018 and 2019?**
- The total net operating loss carry-forwards for both years combined is $255,235 (2018) + $255,269 (2019) = $510,504
- **What is the average tax credits in 2018 and 2019?**
- Average = (2018 tax credits + 2019 tax credits) / 2
- Average = ($2,458 + $2,261) / 2 = $2,359.50
- **What is the percentage change in equity-based compensation between 2018 and 2019?**
- Percentage Change = ((2019 value - 2018 value) / 2018 value) * 100
- Percentage Change = (($4,116 - $3,322) / $3,322) * 100 = 23.88% increase
