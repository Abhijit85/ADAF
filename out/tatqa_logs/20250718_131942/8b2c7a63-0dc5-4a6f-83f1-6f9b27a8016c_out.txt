- The table provides financial data for the years ended December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017. It includes details on net loss, adjustments for non-cash items, and other financial metrics, all presented in thousands of U.S. dollars.
- **What was the amount of Depreciation and amortization in 2018?**
- $102,839 thousand
- **What was the Provision for losses on accounts receivable in 2017?**
- $269 thousand
- **How many years did Net income adjusted for non-cash items exceed $50,000 thousand?**
- One year (2018, where it was $82,362 thousand)
- **What was the change in Impairment losses between 2017 and 2018?**
- Calculation: 2018 Impairment losses ($200,657 thousand) - 2017 Impairment losses ($50,565 thousand) = $150,092 thousand increase
- **What was the percentage change in the Share based compensation between 2017 and 2018?**
- Calculation:
- 2017 Share based compensation = $4,296 thousand
- 2018 Share based compensation = $4,556 thousand
- Percentage change = ((4,556 - 4,296) / 4,296) * 100 = 6.05% increase
