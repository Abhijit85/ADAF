=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

- **Why is net debt analysed as a proportion of EBITDA?**  
  Net debt is analysed as a proportion of EBITDA to assess a company's ability to pay off its debt using its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation. This ratio provides insight into the leverage and financial health of a company, indicating how many years it would take to pay back debt if EBITDA remained constant.

- **How is EBITDA calculated?**  
  EBITDA is calculated by adding depreciation and amortisation to the adjusted operating profit. From the table:  
  - 2019: EBITDA = Adjusted operating profit (£282.7m) + Depreciation and amortisation (£34.3m) = £317.0m  
  - 2018: EBITDA = Adjusted operating profit (£264.9m) + Depreciation and amortisation (£32.9m) = £297.8m

- **What are the components considered when calculating the Net debt to EBITDA ratio?**  
  The components considered are:  
  - Net Debt: The total amount of debt minus cash and cash equivalents.  
  - EBITDA: Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation.

- **In which year was the net debt to EBITDA ratio larger?**  
  The net debt to EBITDA ratio was larger in 2019.  
  - 2019: 0.9  
  - 2018: 0.8

- **What was the change in net debt from 2018 to 2019?**  
  The change in net debt from 2018 to 2019 was an increase of £59.4m.  
  - Calculation: 2019 Net Debt (£295.2m) - 2018 Net Debt (£235.8m) = £59.4m

- **What was the percentage change in net debt from 2018 to 2019?**  
  The percentage change in net debt from 2018 to 2019 was approximately 25.2%.  
  - Calculation: ((£295.2m - £235.8m) / £235.8m) * 100 = 25.2%
