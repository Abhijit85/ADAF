- **What was the amount of capitalized stock-based compensation cost in December 31, 2019?**
- **Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs**
- **What was the increase / (decrease) in the cost from 2018 to 2019?**
- **Calculation**: 2019 Cost = $100 million, 2018 Cost = $82 million
- **Increase**: $100 million - $82 million = $18 million
- **Answer**: "$18 million increase"
- **What is the average Selling, general and administrative?**
- **Values**: 2019 = $453 million, 2018 = $361 million, 2017 = $384 million
- **Calculation**: (453 + 361 + 384) / 3 = 1198 / 3 = $399.33 million
- **Answer**: "$399.33 million"
- **What is the percentage increase / (decrease) of Research, development and engineering from 2018 to 2019?**
- **Values**: 2019 = $126 million, 2018 = $67 million
- **Calculation**: ((126 - 67) / 67) * 100 = (59 / 67) * 100 ≈ 88.06%
- **Answer**: "88.06% increase"
