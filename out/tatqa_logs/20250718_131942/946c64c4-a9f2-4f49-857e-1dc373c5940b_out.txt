Answer Echoes:
- **How many primary service units are excluded from the MetroCast acquisition completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2018?**
- **Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs**
- **What were the net additions for internet service customers in 2019?**
- **Answer**: 21,189
- **What were the net losses for video service customers in 2019?**
- **Answer**: (4,697)
- **What is the increase / (decrease) in the primary service units in net additions(losses) from 2018 to 2019?**
- **Calculation**: 2019 net additions = 16,981, 2018 net additions = 20,251
