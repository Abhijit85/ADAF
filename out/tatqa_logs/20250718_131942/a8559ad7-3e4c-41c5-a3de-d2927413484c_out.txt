Answer Echoes:
- **What does the table show us?**
- The table provides a breakdown of goodwill balances across different business segments from December 31, 2017, to December 31, 2019. It includes details on goodwill acquired, adjustments due to currency translation, reclassifications, and other changes.
- **What was the reclassification and others in 2019 primarily due to?**
- The reclassification and others in 2019 resulted in a net change of $(1.0) million. This was due to a combination of a $1.6 million increase in Application Software and a $(2.6) million decrease in Network Software & Systems.
- **What were the balances of Application Software and Process Technologies on December 31, 2017, respectively?**
- Application Software: $4,565.4 million
- Process Technologies: $318.2 million
- **What is the total goodwill acquired in the Network Software & Systems segment from 2018 to 2019?**
- Total goodwill acquired in Network Software & Systems from 2018 to 2019 is $33.1 million (2018) + $1,303.6 million (2019) = $1,336.7 million.
- **What is the proportion of balances in the Application Software and Process Technologies segments over total balances in all segments at December 31, 2018?**
- Application Software: $5,236.1 million
- Process Technologies: $312.3 million
- Total balances: $9,346.8 million
- Proportion = ($5,236.1 + $312.3) / $9,346.8 = $5,548.4 / $9,346.8 ≈ 0.5936 or 59.36%
- **What is the percentage change in the total balance of goodwill of the Network Software & Systems segment in 2019 compared to 2018?**
- 2018 balance: $2,623.7 million
- 2019 balance: $3,933.5 million
- Percentage change = (($3,933.5 - $2,623.7) / $2,623.7) * 100 ≈ 49.91% increase
