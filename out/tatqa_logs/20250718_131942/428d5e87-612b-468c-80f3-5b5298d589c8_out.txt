Answer Echoes:
- **What were the reasons for the increase in sales from the modules segment in 2019?**
- **Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs.** The table provides numerical data but does not specify reasons for changes in sales.
- **What are the two main currencies involved in the systems business?**
- **Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs.** The table does not specify currencies; it only provides dollar amounts.
- **What was the percentage increase in modules sales from 2018 to 2019?**
- **Answer**: "191% increase"
- **What is the net difference in sale of systems between 2017 and 2019?**
- **Calculation**: 2019 sales = $1,603,001, 2017 sales = $2,134,926
- **Net Difference**: $1,603,001 - $2,134,926 = -$531,925
- **Answer**: "-$531,925"
- **What is the net difference in sale of modules between 2017 and 2019?**
- **Calculation**: 2019 sales = $1,460,116, 2017 sales = $806,398
- **Net Difference**: $1,460,116 - $806,398 = $653,718
- **Answer**: "$653,718"
- **What is the net percentage difference in net sales between 2017 and 2019?**
- **Calculation**: 2019 net sales = $3,063,117, 2017 net sales = $2,941,324
- **Net Difference**: $3,063,117 - $2,941,324 = $121,793
- **Percentage Difference**: ($121,793 / $2,941,324) * 100 = 4.14%
- **Answer**: "4.14% increase"
