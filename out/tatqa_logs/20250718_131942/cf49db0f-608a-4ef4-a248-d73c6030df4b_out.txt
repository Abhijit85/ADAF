Answer Echoes:
- **What does the table represent?**
- The table represents the allocation of assets to different business segments and other categories for the years 2018 and 2019, expressed in millions of dollars.
- **What years are reported by the table?**
- 2019 and 2018
- **What is the total assets for year 2019?**
- $5,765.2 million
- **What is the unrevised value of Food Care for 2018?**
- $1,914.4 million
- **What is the percentage change of total assets from 2018 to 2019?**
- Calculation:
- Total assets in 2018: $5,050.2 million
- Total assets in 2019: $5,765.2 million
- Percentage change = \(\frac{5,765.2 - 5,050.2}{5,050.2} \times 100\)
- Percentage change = \(\frac{715}{5,050.2} \times 100 \approx 14.15\%\)
- **Answer**: 14.15% increase
- **What is the average total asset value for 2018 and 2019?**
- Calculation:
- Total assets in 2018: $5,050.2 million
- Total assets in 2019: $5,765.2 million
- Average = \(\frac{5,050.2 + 5,765.2}{2}\)
- Average = \(\frac{10,815.4}{2} = 5,407.7\) million
- **Answer**: $5,407.7 million
