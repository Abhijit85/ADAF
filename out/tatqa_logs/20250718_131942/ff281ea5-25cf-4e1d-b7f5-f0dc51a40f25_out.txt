=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

- **How is the depreciation calculated?**  
  Depreciation is calculated as the difference between "Total Property, Plant and Equipment, Gross" and "Property, Plant and Equipment, Net". For example, in 2019: $475.6 million (Gross) - $191.9 million (Net) = $283.7 million (Accumulated Depreciation).

- **What was the depreciation expense in 2019, 2018 and 2017 respectively?**  
  2019: $27.2 million, 2018: $22.5 million, 2017: $22.0 million

- **What was the capital expenditures recorded in accounts payable in 2019 and 2018 respectively?**  
  2019: $6.4 million, 2018: $9.0 million

- **What was the change in the land value from 2018 to 2019?**  
  $2.9 million increase

- **What is the average Buildings and Building Improvements value for 2018 and 2019?**  
  $75.2 million

- **In which year was Property, Plant and Equipment, Net less than 170 million?**  
  2018

Answer Echoes:
- **How is the depreciation calculated?**
- Depreciation is calculated as the difference between "Total Property, Plant and Equipment, Gross" and "Property, Plant and Equipment, Net". For example, in 2019: $475.6 million (Gross) - $191.9 million (Net) = $283.7 million (Accumulated Depreciation).
- **What was the depreciation expense in 2019, 2018 and 2017 respectively?**
- The table provides accumulated depreciation for 2019 and 2018, but not the depreciation expense for each year. Depreciation expense would typically be the change in accumulated depreciation from one year to the next. Thus:
- 2019: $283.7 million
- 2018: $272.5 million
- Unable to determine 2017 depreciation expense from the table alone.
- **What was the capital expenditures recorded in accounts payable in 2019 and 2018 respectively?**
- **Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs**. The table does not provide information on capital expenditures recorded in accounts payable.
- **What was the change in the land value from 2018 to 2019?**
- 2019 Land Value: $3.7 million
- 2018 Land Value: $0.8 million
- Change: $3.7 million - $0.8 million = $2.9 million increase
- **What is the average Buildings and Building Improvements value for 2018 and 2019?**
- 2019 Value: $81.2 million
- 2018 Value: $69.2 million
- Average: ($81.2 million + $69.2 million) / 2 = $75.2 million
- **In which year was Property, Plant and Equipment, Net less than 170 million?**
- 2019: $191.9 million
- 2018: $162.2 million
- Answer: 2018 (Property, Plant and Equipment, Net was less than 170 million)
