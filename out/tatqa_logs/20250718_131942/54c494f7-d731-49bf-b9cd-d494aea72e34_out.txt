Answer Echoes:
- **How long is the amortization period for underlying rights (including easements)?**
- **Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs**
- **What is the weighted average remaining amortization period for the company's customer relationships asset?**
- **Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs**
- **How much was the amortization of intangible assets for the year ended June 30, 2019?**
- The amortization for finite-lived intangible assets can be calculated by the change in accumulated amortization from June 30, 2018, to June 30, 2019.
- **Calculation**:
- June 30, 2019: $(500.2)m
- June 30, 2018: $(406.2)m
- Amortization = $(500.2)m - $(406.2)m = $(94.0)m
- **Answer**: "$94.0 million"
- **What was the total accumulated amortization for June 30, 2017?**
- **Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs**
- **How many types of finite-Lived Intangible Assets are there?**
- The table lists two types of finite-lived intangible assets:
- Customer relationships
- Underlying rights and other
- **Answer**: "2 types"
- **What is the net total underlying rights and other for both finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of June 30, 2019?**
- **Finite-Lived**: $1.9 million
- **Indefinite-Lived**: $14.5 million
- **Total Net**: $1.9m + $14.5m = $16.4m
- **Answer**: "$16.4 million"
