Answer Echoes:
- **What were the total liabilities of IMFT in 2018?**
- **Answer**: $1,305
- **What is the ratio of IMFT’s total assets to total liabilities in 2019?**
- **Extraction**: Total assets in 2019 = $2,664, Total liabilities in 2019 = $909
- **Calculation**: Ratio = Total assets / Total liabilities = $2,664 / $909 ≈ 2.93
- **Answer**: Approximately 2.93
- **What is the proportion of IMFT’s property, plant, and equipment over total assets in 2018?**
- **Extraction**: Property, plant, and equipment in 2018 = $2,641, Total assets in 2018 = $3,025
- **Calculation**: Proportion = Property, plant, and equipment / Total assets = $2,641 / $3,025 ≈ 0.873
- **Answer**: Approximately 87.3%
- **What is the change of IMFT’s total assets from 2018 to 2019?**
- **Extraction**: Total assets in 2019 = $2,664, Total assets in 2018 = $3,025
- **Calculation**: Change = Total assets in 2019 - Total assets in 2018 = $2,664 - $3,025 = -$361
- **Answer**: -$361
