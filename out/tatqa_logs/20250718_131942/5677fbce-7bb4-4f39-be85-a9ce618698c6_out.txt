=== FINAL SUMMARY (OPENAI) ===

- **What was the reason for the increase in the Orders?**  
  The increase in orders was due to a higher volume from large orders, with significant growth in Asia, Australia, and the Americas region, driven by large orders in the offshore and onshore businesses.

- **What was the reason for the increase in the Revenue?**  
  Revenue increased significantly year-over-year due to substantial growth in the offshore and service businesses and clear growth in the onshore business, with substantial revenue rise in Europe, C. I. S., Africa, Middle East.

- **What was the reason for the increase in the Adjusted EBITDA?**  
  Adjusted EBITA was on the prior-year level due to positive effects from productivity improvements and higher revenue being offset by price declines, a less favorable project mix, and higher expenses for integration costs and capacity adjustments including severance.
