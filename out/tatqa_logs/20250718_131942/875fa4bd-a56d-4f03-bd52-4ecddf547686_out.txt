=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

- **How are the realized and unrealized losses recognized?**  
  Realized and unrealized losses of the cross currency swaps are recognized in earnings and reported in foreign exchange (loss) gain in the consolidated statements of loss.

- **What were the Realized losses in 2019, 2018 and 2017?**  
  2019: $(5062), 2018: $(6533), 2017: $(18494)

- **Why are interest rate swaps entered into with different counterparties?**  
  Interest rate swaps are entered into with different counterparties to reduce concentration risk.

- **What is the increase / (decrease) in the Realized gains (losses) on maturity and/or partial termination of cross currency swap from 2018 to 2019?**  
  $42271 increase

- **What was the average realized losses?**  
  $(10029.67)

- **What is the percentage increase / (decrease) in the Unrealized (losses) gains from 2017 to 2018?**  
  74.31% decrease

- **What were the Realized losses in 2019, 2018 and 2017?**
- 2019: $(5,062)

- **What is the increase / (decrease) in the Realized gains (losses) on maturity and/or partial termination of cross currency swap from 2018 to 2019?**
- 2018: $(42,271)
- 2019: $0
- Calculation: $0 - (-$42,271) = $42,271 increase
- **What was the average realized losses?**
- Realized losses: 2019: $(5,062), 2018: $(6,533), 2017: $(18,494)
- Calculation: \((-5,062) + (-6,533) + (-18,494)\) / 3 = \(-30,089 / 3 = -10,029.67\)
- Average: $(10,029.67)
- **What is the percentage increase / (decrease) in the Unrealized (losses) gains from 2017 to 2018?**
- 2017: $82,668
- 2018: $21,240
- Calculation: \((21,240 - 82,668) / 82,668 \times 100 = -74.31\%\)
- Percentage decrease: 74.31%
