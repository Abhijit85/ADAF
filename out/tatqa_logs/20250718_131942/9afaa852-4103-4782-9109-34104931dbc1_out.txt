=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

- **What was the Net operating loss carry forward in 2019?**  
  $183297

- **What were the Receivables in 2018?**  
  $7111

- **What was the accrued expenses in 2019?**  
  $81731

- **How many components of deferred tax assets exceeded $50000 thousand in 2019?**  
  Three components exceeded $50000 in 2019: Net operating loss carry forward: $183297, Accrued expenses: $81731, Property, plant and equipment: $66268

- **What was the change in accrued expenses between 2018 and 2019?**
