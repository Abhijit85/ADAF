Answer Echoes:
- **What is the Group's assumptions on mortality?**
- The table provides life expectancy assumptions for members aged 65 and 45, indicating the expected years they are projected to live.
- **What is the current average life expectancy in 2019 for a male member aged 65 in years?**
- 86.8 years
- **For which years is the average life expectancy for a pensioner retiring at age 65 provided for?**
- 2018 and 2019
- **In which year was the average life expectancy for a male member aged 65 higher?**
- 2018, with a life expectancy of 87.3 years
- **What was the change in the average life expectancy for a male member aged 65 in 2019 from 2018?**
- The change was a decrease of 0.5 years (86.8 in 2019 - 87.3 in 2018).
- **What was the percentage change in the average life expectancy for a male member aged 65 in 2019 from 2018?**
- The percentage change was approximately -0.57% [(86.8 - 87.3) / 87.3 * 100].
