Answer Echoes:
- **What are the respective depreciation expense from continuing operations in 2019 and 2018 respectively?**
- **2019**: The depreciation expense from continuing operations is the difference between the accumulated depreciation and amortization for 2019 and 2018 for property, plant, and equipment, excluding internal use software.
- 2019: \( (19,981) - (17,884) = (2,097) \)
- **2018**: The depreciation expense for 2018 is not directly calculable from the table as it requires the previous year's accumulated depreciation.
- **What are the respective depreciation expense from continuing operations in 2019 and 2018 related to internal use software costs respectively?**
- **2019**: The depreciation expense related to internal use software is the difference between the accumulated depreciation and amortization for internal use software for 2019 and 2018.
- 2019: \( (25,853) - (16,846) = (9,007) \)
- **2018**: The depreciation expense for 2018 is not directly calculable from the table as it requires the previous year's accumulated depreciation.
- **What are the respective amounts capitalized to internal use software related to continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018?**
- **2019**: The amount capitalized to internal use software is the sum of "Internal use software" and "Construction in progress - Internal use software" for 2019.
- 2019: \( 33,351 + 2,973 = 36,324 \)
- **2018**: The amount capitalized to internal use software is the sum of "Internal use software" and "Construction in progress - Internal use software" for 2018.
- 2018: \( 31,565 + 903 = 32,468 \)
- **What is the total amount capitalized to internal use software related to continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018?**
- **Total**: Sum of the amounts capitalized for both years.
- Total: \( 36,324 + 32,468 = 68,792 \)
- **What is the total value of computer equipment and software at the end of 2018 and 2019 altogether?**
- **Total Value**: Sum of the values for 2018 and 2019.
- Total: \( 14,689 + 14,058 = 28,747 \)
- **What is the average value of computer equipment and software in both 2018 and 2019?**
- **Average Value**: The average of the values for 2018 and 2019.
- Average: \( \frac{14,689 + 14,058}{2} = 14,373.5 \)
