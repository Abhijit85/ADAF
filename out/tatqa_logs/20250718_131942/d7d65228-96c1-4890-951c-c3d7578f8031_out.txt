  $0.75 (NT dollars)

- **What is the average Legal reserve within Appropriation of earnings?**  
  $835623 (in thousand NT dollars)

- **What is the increase/ (decrease) in Legal reserve within Appropriation of earnings from 2018 to 2019?**  
  $256648 (in thousand NT dollars)

- **What is the increase/ (decrease) in Cash dividends within Appropriation of earnings from 2018 to 2019?**

Answer Echoes:
- **What was the legal reserve amount in 2019?**
- $963,947 (in thousand NT dollars)
- **What is the implication for reserving debit elements?**
- **Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs**
- **What was the cash dividend per share in 2019?**
- $0.75 (NT dollars)
- **What is the average Legal reserve within Appropriation of earnings?**
- Calculation:
- 2018 Legal reserve = $707,299
- 2019 Legal reserve = $963,947
- Average = ($707,299 + $963,947) / 2 = $835,623 (in thousand NT dollars)
- **What is the increase/ (decrease) in Legal reserve within Appropriation of earnings from 2018 to 2019?**
- Calculation:
- 2019 Legal reserve = $963,947
- 2018 Legal reserve = $707,299
- Increase = $963,947 - $707,299 = $256,648 (in thousand NT dollars)
- **What is the increase/ (decrease) in Cash dividends within Appropriation of earnings from 2018 to 2019?**
- Calculation:
- 2019 Cash dividends = $9,765,155
- 2018 Cash dividends = $6,916,105
- Increase = $9,765,155 - $6,916,105 = $2,849,050 (in thousand NT dollars)
