Answer Echoes:
- **What does the recorded investment include?**
- **Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs**
- **What was the decline in the global financing receivables?**
- **Calculation**: 2018 Net financing receivables = $30,890 million, 2019 Net financing receivables = $22,224 million
- **Decline**: $30,890 million - $22,224 million = $8,666 million
- **Answer**: "$8,666 million decline"
- **What is the total allowance for credit losses in 2019?**
- **Extraction**: Total allowance for credit losses in 2019 = $221 million
- **Answer**: "$221 million"
- **What is the increase / (decrease) in the recorded investment from 2018 to 2019?**
- **Calculation**: 2018 Recorded investment = $31,182 million, 2019 Recorded investment = $22,446 million
- **Decrease**: $22,446 million - $31,182 million = -$8,736 million
- **Answer**: "$8,736 million decrease"
- **What is the average Specific allowance for credit losses?**
- **Calculation**: (2018 Specific allowance = 220, 2019 Specific allowance = 177)
- **Average**: (220 + 177) / 2 = 198.5
- **Answer**: "198.5"
- **What is the percentage increase / (decrease) in the Net financing receivables from 2018 to 2019?**
- **Calculation**: 2018 Net financing receivables = $30,890 million, 2019 Net financing receivables = $22,224 million
- **Percentage Change**: ((22,224 - 30,890) / 30,890) * 100 = -28.06%
- **Answer**: "28.06% decrease"
