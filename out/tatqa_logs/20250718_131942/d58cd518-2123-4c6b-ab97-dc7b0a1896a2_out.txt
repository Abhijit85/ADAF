=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

- **How is the basic and diluted net loss per ordinary share calculated?**  
  The basic and diluted net loss per ordinary share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.

- **What was the Unvested RSUs in 2019, 2018 and 2017 respectively?**  
  2019: 550, 2018: 33, 2017: 28

- **What was the Share options outstanding in 2019, 2018 and 2017 respectively?**  
  2019: 6209, 2018: 6230, 2017: 8681

- **What was the change in Share options outstanding from 2018 to 2019?**  
  -21

- **What was the average Unvested RSUs between 2017-2019?**  
  203.67

- **In which year was Unvested RSUs less than 100 thousands?**  
  2018 and 2017
