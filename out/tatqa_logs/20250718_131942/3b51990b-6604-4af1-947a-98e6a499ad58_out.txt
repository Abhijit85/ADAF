Answer Echoes:
- **What was the net income in 2019?**
- $1,169
- **What were the Potential shares from outstanding employee equity awards in 2019?**
- 5
- **What were the Shares used in basic computation in 2018?**
- 268
- **What was the change in the basic net income per share between 2017 and 2018?**
- Calculation: $0.43 (2018) - $1.75 (2017) = -$1.32
- Answer: -$1.32
- **What was the change in the Dilutive impact of employee equity award plans between 2018 and 2019?**
- Calculation: 5 (2019) - 8 (2018) = -3
- Answer: -3
- **What was the total percentage change in the Shares used in diluted computation between 2017 and 2019?**
- Calculation:
- Initial value (2017): 281
- Final value (2019): 259
- Percentage change = ((259 - 281) / 281) * 100 = (-22 / 281) * 100 ≈ -7.83%
- Answer: Approximately -7.83%
