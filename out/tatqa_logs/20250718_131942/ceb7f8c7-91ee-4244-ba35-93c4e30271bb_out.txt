Answer Echoes:
- **What is the average duration of the accounts receivables?**
- **Answer**: **Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs**. The table provides the accounts receivable amounts but does not include information on the average duration.
- **How much was borrowed under credit facilities during 2019?**
- **Answer**: **Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs**. The table does not include information on borrowings under credit facilities.
- **How much was the debt outstanding as at 2019 year end?**
- **Answer**: **Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs**. The table does not provide information on total debt outstanding.
- **What was the percentage change in cash and cash equivalents from 2018 to 2019 year end?**
- **Calculation**:
- 2019 Cash and Cash Equivalents = $9,472
- 2018 Cash and Cash Equivalents = $7,554
- Percentage Change = \(\frac{9,472 - 7,554}{7,554} \times 100\)
- Percentage Change = \(\frac{1,918}{7,554} \times 100 \approx 25.39\%\)
- **Answer**: "25.39% increase"
- **What was the percentage change in net inventories from 2018 to 2019 year end?**
- **Calculation**:
- 2019 Net Inventories = $12,542
- 2018 Net Inventories = $9,317
- Percentage Change = \(\frac{12,542 - 9,317}{9,317} \times 100\)
- Percentage Change = \(\frac{3,225}{9,317} \times 100 \approx 34.61\%\)
- **Answer**: "34.61% increase"
- **What was the percentage change in accounts payables from 2018 to 2019 year end?**
- **Calculation**:
- 2019 Accounts Payable = $(18,668)
- 2018 Accounts Payable = $(9,166)
- Percentage Change = \(\frac{-18,668 - (-9,166)}{-9,166} \times 100\)
- Percentage Change = \(\frac{-9,502}{-9,166} \times 100 \approx 103.69\%\)
- **Answer**: "103.69% increase"
