=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

- **How is Earning Per Share (EPS) calculated?**  
  EPS is calculated by dividing the net (loss) income attributable to common stock by the weighted average common shares outstanding. For basic EPS, use the basic shares, and for diluted EPS, use the diluted shares.

- **Did the company have any dilutive common share equivalents in 2019?**  
  No, the company did not have any dilutive common share equivalents in 2019, as the weighted average common shares outstanding - basic and diluted are both 44.8.

- **What was the Net (loss) income attributable to common stock and participating preferred stockholders in 2019?**  
  The net (loss) income attributable to common stock and participating preferred stockholders in 2019 was $(31.5) million.

- **What is the increase / (decrease) in the Weighted-average common stock outstanding from 2018 to 2019?**  
  The weighted-average common stock outstanding increased by 0.5 million from 44.3 in 2018 to 44.8 in 2019.

- **What is the average unvested restricted stock?**  
  The average unvested restricted stock is calculated as the average of 0.6 (2019) and 0.4 (2018), which is 0.5.

- **What was the average Preferred stock (as-converted basis)?**  
  The average preferred stock (as-converted basis) is calculated as the average of 2.1 (2019) and 4.9 (2018), which is 3.5.
