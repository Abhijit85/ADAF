- **Where are subsidiary undertakings disclosed?**
- **Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs**
- **What are the components factored in the calculation of investments in subsidiaries at end of the period?**
- The components are:
- At beginning of the period
- Additions
- These components are summed to calculate the "At end of the period" value.
- **In which year were Additions larger?**
- 2019: £3.1m
- 2018: £2.4m
- **Answer**: 2019
- **What was the change in Additions in 2019 from 2018?**
- 2019 Additions = £3.1m
- 2018 Additions = £2.4m
- Change = £3.1m - £2.4m = £0.7m
- **Answer**: £0.7m increase
- **What was the percentage change in Additions in 2019 from 2018?**
- 2019 Additions = £3.1m
- 2018 Additions = £2.4m
- Percentage Change = ((£3.1m - £2.4m) / £2.4m) * 100 = (0.7 / 2.4) * 100 ≈ 29.17%
- **Answer**: 29.17% increase
