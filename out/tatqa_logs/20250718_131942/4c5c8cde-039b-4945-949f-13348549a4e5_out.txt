=== FINAL SUMMARY (OPENAI) ===

- **In 2019, why did the gross margin decrease?**  
  The gross margin decreased in 2019 due to a reduction in gross profit from $3861 million in 2018 to $3696 million in 2019, despite a slight increase in cost of sales. This resulted in a gross margin decrease of 130 basis points.

- **In 2018, why did the gross margin improve from the previous year?**  
  The gross margin improved in 2018 due to an increase in gross profit from $3272 million in 2017 to $3861 million in 2018, while the cost of sales increased at a lower rate. This led to an improvement in gross margin by 80 basis points.

- **What was the percentage of gross margin in 2018?**  
  40.0%

- **What is the average Cost of sales?**  
  −$5579.33 million

- **What is the average Gross profit?**  
  $3609.67 million

  39.3%

Answer Echoes:
- **In 2019, why did the gross margin decrease?**
- The gross margin decreased in 2019 due to a reduction in gross profit from $3,861 million in 2018 to $3,696 million in 2019, despite a slight increase in cost of sales. This resulted in a gross margin decrease of 130 basis points.
- **In 2018, why did the gross margin improve from the previous year?**
- The gross margin improved in 2018 due to an increase in gross profit from $3,272 million in 2017 to $3,861 million in 2018, while the cost of sales increased at a lower rate. This led to an improvement in gross margin by 80 basis points.
- **What was the percentage of gross margin in 2018?**
- The percentage of gross margin in 2018 was 40.0%.
- **What is the average Cost of sales?**
- To calculate the average cost of sales:
- 2019: $(5,860) million
- 2018: $(5,803) million
- 2017: $(5,075) million
- Average = (−5,860 − 5,803 − 5,075) / 3 = −$5,579.33 million
- **What is the average Gross profit?**
- To calculate the average gross profit:
- 2019: $3,696 million
- 2018: $3,861 million
- 2017: $3,272 million
- Average = (3,696 + 3,861 + 3,272) / 3 = $3,609.67 million
- **What is the average Gross margin (as percentage of net revenues)?**
- To calculate the average gross margin percentage:
- 2019: 38.7%
- 2018: 40.0%
- 2017: 39.2%
- Average = (38.7 + 40.0 + 39.2) / 3 = 39.3%
