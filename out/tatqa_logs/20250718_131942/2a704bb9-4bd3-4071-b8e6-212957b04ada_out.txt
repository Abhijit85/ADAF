Answer Echoes:
- **What is the 2019 carrying amount of interest rate swaps?**
- **Answer**: (494) RMB Million
- **What is the 2018 carrying amount of interest rate swaps?**
- **Answer**: 1,663 RMB Million
- **What is the 2019 notional amount of the interest rate swaps?**
- **Answer**: 29,423 RMB Million
- **How much is the change between 2018 to 2019 carrying amount of the interest rate swaps?**
- **Calculation**: 2019 carrying amount - 2018 carrying amount = (494) - 1,663 = -2,157
- **Answer**: -2,157 RMB Million
- **How much is the change between 2018 and 2019 notional amount of the interest rate swaps?**
- **Calculation**: 2019 notional amount - 2018 notional amount = 29,423 - 77,630 = -48,207
- **Answer**: -48,207 RMB Million
- **How many percent did the weighted average hedged rate for the year change by from 2018 to 2019?**
- **Calculation**: 2019 rate - 2018 rate = 2.10% - 1.60% = 0.50%
- **Answer**: 0.50% increase
