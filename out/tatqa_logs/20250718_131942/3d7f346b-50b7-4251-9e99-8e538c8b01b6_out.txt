=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

- **What was the reason for the increase in net cash used in investing activities?**  
  The increase in net cash used in investing activities was mainly attributable to an increase of $591.5 million in payments for the construction costs of newbuildings and other fixed assets and a net decrease in cash from short-term investments of $43.0 million in 2018 compared to 2017.
