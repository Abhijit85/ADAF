=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals a substantial increase in the value of property, plant, and equipment, alongside a notable rise in accumulated depreciation.

1. Land value saw a significant increase of $2.9 million, rising from $0.8 million to $3.7 million, indicating a strong appreciation in real estate assets.
2. Buildings and Building Improvements and Machinery and Equipment experienced substantial growth, with increases of $12 million and $26 million, respectively, contributing to a total rise in Property, Plant and Equipment, Gross by $40.9 million, from $434.7 million to $475.6 million.
3. Despite the increase in accumulated depreciation by $11.2 million, from $272.5 million to $283.7 million, its percentage of Total Property, Plant and Equipment, Gross decreased slightly from 62.7% to 59.6%, suggesting efficient asset utilization.
4. The net value of Property, Plant and Equipment increased by $29.7 million, from $162.2 million to $191.9 million, reflecting overall asset growth after accounting for depreciation.
