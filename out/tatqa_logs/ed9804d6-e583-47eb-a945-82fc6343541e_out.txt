=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of asset trends reveals significant shifts in various categories of property, plant, and equipment, with notable changes in software-related assets.

1. **Computer Equipment and Software Growth**: There was a notable increase in computer equipment and software by 631, from 14058 to 14689, indicating a potential investment in technological upgrades or expansion.

2. **Decline in Furniture and Equipment**: Furniture and equipment saw a substantial decrease of 966, from 3732 to 2766, which may suggest a divestment or reallocation of resources away from physical assets.

3. **Internal Use Software Adjustments**: Internal use software, net experienced a significant drop of 5151, from 15622 to 10471, contrasting with the increase in construction in progress for internal use software by 2070, from 903 to 2973, highlighting a shift towards developing new software capabilities.

4. **Depreciation Trends**: Accumulated depreciation and amortization increased by 2097, from (17884) to (19981), with a significant rise in internal use software depreciation by 9007, from (16846) to (25853), reflecting ongoing asset aging and usage.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Computer equipment and software increased by 631 (14,058→14,689).
- [TREND] Furniture and equipment decreased by 966 (3,732→2,766).
- [ANOMALY] Construction in progress - PPE appeared in 2019 with 949, absent in 2018.
- [TREND] Accumulated depreciation and amortization increased by 2,097 ((17,884)→(19,981)).
- [RATIO] Accumulated depreciation and amortization, internal use software increased significantly by 9,007 ((16,846)→(25,853)).
- [OUTLIER] Internal use software, net decreased by 5,151 (15,622→10,471), a significant drop compared to other categories.
- [TREND] Construction in progress - Internal use software increased by 2,070 (903→2,973).
- [TREND] Property, plant and equipment, net decreased by 6,883 ($22,978→$16,095).
- [DEFINITION] "Useful lives for leasehold and building improvements" are the shorter of lease term or improvement life.
- [SCOPE] Depreciation expense for 2019 and 2018 was $12,548 and $12,643, respectively.
- [SOURCE] $9,028 and $9,189 of depreciation relate to internal use software for 2019 and 2018.
- [SCOPE] Capitalized internal use software costs were $3,800 in 2019 and $6,690 in 2018.
- [NOTE] Depreciation and capitalization figures relate to "continuing operations".
