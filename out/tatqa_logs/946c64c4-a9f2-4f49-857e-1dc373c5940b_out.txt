=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of service penetration rates reveals a shift in customer preferences, with internet services gaining traction while video and telephony services decline.

1. Internet service penetration increased by 1.1% (from 49.7 to 50.8), with a net addition of 21189 customers, indicating a growing demand for high-speed internet.
2. Video service penetration decreased by 1.5% (from 37.1 to 35.6), with a net loss of 4697 customers, highlighting the impact of competitive offers and changing consumption habits.
3. Telephony service penetration saw a slight decline of 0.4% (from 16.6 to 16.2), with net additions dropping significantly to 489 from 5594 the previous year.
4. Primary service units experienced a substantial net addition of 901446, suggesting a strong overall growth in core service offerings, excluding the MetroCast acquisition figures from fiscal 2018.
