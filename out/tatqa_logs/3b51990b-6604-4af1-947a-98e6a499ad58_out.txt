=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's profitability, as measured by basic and diluted net income per share, experienced significant changes between 2017 and 2019. 
1. The basic net income per share saw a substantial decrease of $1.32, from $1.75 in 2017 to $0.43 in 2018. This indicates a decline in profitability during this period.
2. The dilutive impact of employee equity award plans also decreased by 3, from 8 in 2018 to 5 in 2019. This suggests a reduction in the potential dilution of earnings per share due to these awards.
3. The shares used in diluted computation decreased by approximately 7.83% between 2017 and 2019. This could have contributed to the decrease in diluted net income per share over this period.
4. However, anomalies in the data, such as the unusually low net income of $1169 in 2019 and the low number of potential shares from outstanding employee equity awards in 2019 (5), may have affected these trends.

Answer Echoes:
- [ANOMALY] The net income in 2019 was $ 1,169
- [ANOMALY] The Potential shares from outstanding employee equity awards in 2019 were 5
- [ANOMALY] The Shares used in basic computation in 2018 were 268
- [TREND] The basic net income per share changed by $ -1.32 ($ 1.75→$ 0.43) between 2017 and 2018
- [TREND] The Dilutive impact of employee equity award plans changed by -3 (8→5) between 2018 and 2019
- [RATIO] The total percentage change in the Shares used in diluted computation between 2017 and 2019 was approximately -7.83% ((281-259)/281*100)
