=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In 2019, the company experienced a remarkable increase in net income and earnings per share, marking a significant financial improvement from previous years.

1. **Net Income Surge**: The net income saw a substantial rise from $116 in 2018 to $1169 in 2019, representing an increase of $1053, which is considered an outlier compared to previous years.
   
2. **Earnings Per Share Growth**: Basic net income per share increased more than tenfold from $0.43 in 2018 to $4.60 in 2019, while diluted net income per share rose from $0.42 to $4.51, indicating strong earnings performance.

3. **Share Count Reduction**: The number of shares used in basic computation decreased by 21, from 275 in 2017 to 254 in 2019, and in diluted computation by 22, from 281 to 259, which may have contributed to the higher earnings per share.

4. **Consistency in Earnings Calculation**: The ratio of basic to diluted net income per share remained consistent in 2019, with figures of $4.60 and $4.51, respectively, suggesting stable earnings calculations despite the significant financial changes.
