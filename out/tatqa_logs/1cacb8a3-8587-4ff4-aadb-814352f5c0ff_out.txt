=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial data reveals significant changes in subsidiary debts, derivative instruments, and tax-related entries between 2018 and 2019.

1. **Subsidiary Debts**: The amounts owed by subsidiaries saw a substantial increase of €22105 million, rising from €220871 million to €242976 million, indicating a significant expansion in inter-company financing.

2. **Derivative Instruments**: There was a notable rise in derivative financial instruments, with those due within one year increasing by €20 million (from €163 million to €183 million) and those due after more than one year increasing by €990 million (from €2449 million to €3439 million), suggesting heightened activity in financial risk management.

3. **Taxation and Debtors**: An anomaly was observed with taxation recoverable appearing at €233 million in 2019, absent in 2018, while deferred tax present at €31 million in 2018 was absent in 2019. Additionally, other debtors decreased significantly by €167 million, from €199 million to €32 million, highlighting shifts in tax and debtor management strategies.

- [DEFINITION] "Amounts owed to subsidiaries" are recorded at "amortised cost".
- [SCOPE] Applies to amounts owed in 2018 and beyond, with changes from "loans and receivables".
- [NOTE] Expected credit losses are "considered to be immaterial" due to liquidity.
