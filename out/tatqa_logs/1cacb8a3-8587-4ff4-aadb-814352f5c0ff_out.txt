=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial items due within one year and after more than one year consist of various components, with notable anomalies in 2019. 
1. The financial items due within one year include amounts owed by subsidiaries, taxation recoverable, other debtors, and derivative financial instruments. In 2019, the taxation recoverable due within one year was €233m, and the average total amount due within one year was €243424m.
2. The financial items due after more than one year consist of derivative financial instruments and deferred tax. The average total amount due after more than one year in 2019 was €3439m.
3. There was an increase in the amounts owed by subsidiaries falling due within one year from €220871m in 2018 to €242976m in 2019.
4. However, the context does not provide detailed information on amounts falling due within or after one year, taxation recoverable, or average total amounts, nor does it provide a comparison of amounts owed by subsidiaries between 2018 and 2019.
