=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In 2019, the company's total past due was 7427, with significant differences observed in the risk levels and due periods of trade receivables and contract assets. 
1. The difference between low and medium country risk for 1-90 days past due was 456, indicating a higher amount of assets due from low-risk countries within this period.
2. A significant drop of 1222 was observed in the low-risk country category when comparing the 1-90 and 91-180 days past due periods, suggesting a high rate of payment within the first 90 days.
3. The difference between 181-360 and >360 days due for all countries was 1503, showing a substantial increase in the amount due after 360 days.
4. The company's ten largest customers represented a significant 49% of the total trade receivables and contract assets in 2019, indicating a high concentration of assets in a small number of clients. This could potentially increase the company's financial risk if any of these clients were to default.
