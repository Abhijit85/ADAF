=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals key trends and anomalies in the company's interest expenses and comprehensive income over recent years.

1. **Interest Expense Trend**: The total interest expense, net has shown a decreasing trend from $140 in 2017 to $133 in 2020, indicating improved cost management or favorable interest rate conditions.

2. **Comprehensive Income Anomaly**: There was a significant swing in the amount recognized in other comprehensive (loss) income, from $10 in 2017 to $(55) in 2020, with the 2020 figure being an outlier compared to previous years.

3. **Reclassification Stability**: The amount reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings remained relatively stable, with $(6) in 2018 and $(7) in 2020, suggesting consistent financial strategies.

4. **Hedge Impact**: Cash flow hedges, covering $1.5 billion in loans, stabilize interest payments and affect other comprehensive income, with an expected reclassification of $1 million into earnings within 12 months, highlighting the importance of hedge effectiveness assessments.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Total interest expense, net decreased over the years: $140 (2017) → $138 (2018) → $133 (2020).
- [ANOMALY] Amount recognized in other comprehensive (loss) income showed a significant swing: $10 (2017) → $(7) (2018) → $(55) (2020).
- [OUTLIER] The amount recognized in other comprehensive (loss) income in 2020 is an outlier at $(55) compared to previous years.
- [RATIO] The ratio of amount reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings to total interest expense, net in 2020 is $(7)/$133 ≈ 5.26%.
- [TREND] Amount reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings remained relatively stable: $(6) (2018) → $(7) (2020).
- [ANOMALY] The absence of a reclassification amount in 2017 is notable compared to subsequent years.
- [DEFINITION] "Cash flow hedges" stabilize interest payments on "Variable Rate Loans" using interest rate swaps.
- [SCOPE] Swaps cover $1.5 billion of loans with a maturity date of August 2025.
- [SOURCE] Interest rate swaps have fixed rates, e.g., 3.00% for swaps maturing in 2025.
- [NOTE] Gains/losses on swaps affect "other comprehensive income" and are reclassified into earnings.
- [SCOPE] The company expects to reclassify $1 million from accumulated loss to earnings in 12 months.
- [WARNING] Hedge effectiveness is assessed quarterly; changes may affect reported figures.
