=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals a notable decrease in total expenses from 2018 to 2019, driven by changes in incentive schemes and unreported benefits.

1. Salaries and fees remained constant at 4 €m across 2017, 2018, and 2019, indicating stability in base compensation.
2. Incentive schemes saw a reduction from 3 €m in 2018 to 2 €m in 2019, after being 2 €m in 2017, reflecting a strategic cutback in performance-related pay.
3. Other benefits, which were 1 €m in both 2017 and 2018, were not reported in 2019, suggesting a possible elimination or reclassification of these benefits.
4. Total expenses decreased from 8 €m in 2018 to 6 €m in 2019, following an increase from 7 €m in 2017 to 8 €m in 2018, highlighting a significant cost reduction effort in the latest year.
