2. Financing costs rose sharply by €1014m, from (€1074m) in 2018 to (€2088m) in 2019, reflecting increased borrowing expenses.
3. Net financing costs surged by €1266m, from (€389m) in 2018 to (€1655m) in 2019, driven by mark-to-market losses of (€423m) and foreign exchange losses of (€190m).
4. Interest income from tax settlements dropped significantly from €11m in 2018 to €1m in 2019, contributing to the overall increase in net financing costs.
