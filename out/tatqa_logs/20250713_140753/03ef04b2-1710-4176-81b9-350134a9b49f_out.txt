=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In 2019, there was a significant increase in total derivative liabilities, primarily driven by a surge in interest rate swaps.

1. Total derivative liabilities rose sharply from 12092 in 2018 to 49932 in 2019, indicating a substantial increase in financial commitments.
2. Interest rate swaps experienced a dramatic increase from 9196 in 2018 to 49891 in 2019, highlighting a strategic shift to manage interest rate exposure.
3. Forward foreign exchange contracts saw a notable decrease from 1467 in 2018 to just 41 in 2019, suggesting a reduced focus on currency risk management.
4. Cross currency swaps, which were at 1429 in 2018, were completely absent in 2019, marking a significant change in the derivative portfolio.
5. Both current and non-current liabilities for derivative financial instruments increased, with current liabilities rising from 2091 in 2018 to 8095 in 2019, and non-current liabilities from 10001 in 2018 to 41837 in 2019, reflecting a broader trend of increased derivative usage.
