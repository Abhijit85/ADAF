=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Sales increased by 5.0% to $8.7 billion, but profitability metrics showed a decline due to rising costs and reduced margins.

1. EBITDA decreased by 4.1%, from 603 to 579, indicating a decline in operating profitability despite higher sales.
2. Depreciation and amortisation rose by 20.1%, from (87) to (105), contributing to the decrease in EBIT by 8.2%, from 516 to 474.
3. The gross margin slightly decreased by 16 basis points to 22.9%, while the cost of doing business increased by 63 basis points to 17.4%, impacting overall profitability.
4. Return on Funds Employed (ROFE) fell by 190 basis points to 15.2%, reflecting less efficient use of capital despite a slight decrease in funds employed by 0.9%, from 3214 to 3185.
