=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial metrics from 2017 to 2019 reveal subtle shifts in dividend yield, expected volatility, and option valuation, reflecting a stable yet slightly fluctuating market environment.

1. The dividend yield experienced a minor decrease from 4.6% in 2018 to 4.5% in 2019, following an increase from 4.1% in 2017 to 4.6% in 2018, indicating a slight decline in shareholder returns.
   
2. Expected volatility showed a downward trend, decreasing from 28.7% in 2018 to 28.3% in 2019, after rising from 27.1% in 2017 to 28.7% in 2018, suggesting a reduction in market uncertainty.

3. The risk-free interest rate remained stable at 2.5% from 2018 to 2019, after an increase from 2.0% in 2017, reflecting consistent economic conditions.

4. The expected life of the option term decreased steadily from 4.5 years in 2017 to 4.3 years in 2019, indicating a trend towards shorter investment horizons.

5. The weighted-average per share grant date fair value of options increased from $7.06 in 2017 to $8.92 in 2019, highlighting a rise in the perceived value of options granted.

Answer Echoes:
- "The weighted-average per share grant date fair value of options was $8.92 in 2019, $8.45 in 2018 and $7.06 in 2017."
- "The Company estimates its forfeiture rate based on historical data with further consideration given to the class of employees to whom the options or shares were granted."
