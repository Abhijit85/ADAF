=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's 2019 free cash flow is reported at €4411m, with the measures of free cash flow and capital additions used to assess liquidity and operational cash generation. 
1. The company's operating free cash flow is derived from cash generated by operations, capital additions, working capital movement in respect of capital additions, disposal of property, plant, and equipment, restructuring payments, and other factors. 
2. Free cash flow (pre-spectrum) is calculated by adding taxation, dividends received from associates and investments, dividends paid to non-controlling shareholders in subsidiaries, and interest received and paid to the operating free cash flow. 
3. The measures of free cash flow and capital additions do not include payments for licenses and spectrum included within intangible assets, items determined independently of the ongoing business, and discretionary items. 
4. Despite not being recognized within IFRS, these measures are used by the company for planning, reporting, and incentive purposes, and facilitate comparability of results with other companies, although they may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
