=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In 2019, total revenue experienced a notable decline, driven by decreases in both services and software revenue streams.

1. Total revenue fell by 9%, from $69549 to $63333, with services revenue decreasing by 8% from $64476 to $59545, indicating a broad downturn in the company's financial performance.
2. Services revenue, which includes customer support and licensing fees, made up approximately 94% of the total revenue in 2019, highlighting its critical role in the company's revenue structure.
3. Software and other revenue saw a significant 25% drop from $5073 to $3788, largely due to the cancellation of a significant partner contract, underscoring the volatility and dependency on key partnerships in this segment.
4. The decline in revenue is attributed to a decrease in billable hours from major customers, suggesting potential challenges in customer retention or demand within the services sector.
