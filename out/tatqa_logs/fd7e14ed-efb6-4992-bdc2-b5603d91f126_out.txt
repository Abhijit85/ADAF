In 2019, the company experienced a substantial increase in total profit and earnings per share, largely driven by gains from discontinued operations.

2. Total profit rose from $1724M in 2018 to $2693M in 2019, reflecting the impact of the gains from discontinued operations.

4. Despite the overall increase in earnings per share, basic earnings per share for continuing operations decreased from 123.4 cents in 2018 to 114.3 cents in 2019, indicating a decline in the profitability of ongoing business activities.
