=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company experienced a significant increase in interest expense and acquisition-related charges in 2019. 
1. The interest expense, which is the cost of borrowing to support the Global Financing external business, increased by $621 million from $723 million in 2018 to $1344 million in 2019. This increase was due to a higher average debt balance and higher interest rates.
2. The company also issued debt to finance the Red Hat acquisition, which impacted the interest expense. 
3. In addition to the overall interest expense, the operating (non-GAAP) interest expense, which excludes the Red Hat pre-closing debt financing costs, also increased by $393 million from $723 million in 2018 to $1116 million in 2019.
4. An anomaly was observed in acquisition-related charges, which were $228 million in 2019, compared to none in 2018. However, the context does not provide information on any acquisition-related charges from 2018 to 2019.
