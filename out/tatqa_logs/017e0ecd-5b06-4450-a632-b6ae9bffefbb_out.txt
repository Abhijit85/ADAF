=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The data provides insights into the general and administrative expenses of a company over the fiscal years 2017 to 2019. 

1. There is a notable increase in general and administrative expenses from fiscal year 2017 to 2019, amounting to $37556. This figure represents the total change over the two-year period, with $2682 in 2019 and $34874 in 2018.
2. The average annual total change in these expenses for the same period is $18778, calculated by dividing the total change ($37556) by the number of years (2).
3. There is a significant difference in the increase of Travel and communication expense in fiscal years 2019 and 2018 as compared to 2018 and 2017, amounting to 714 ($794 in 2019 and 2018 - $80 in 2018 and 2017).
4. The company had 1620 employees in the general and administrative labour as of June 30, 2019.
5. General and administrative expenses, which primarily consist of payroll and related benefits expenses, overhead, audit fees, professional fees, contract labour, consulting expenses and public company costs, remained approximately 7% of the total revenue. 

However, the data lacks information on the number of employees in the general and administrative labour for the fiscal year 2019 and the breakdown of general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue.
