=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial performance shows mixed results, with improvements in operational metrics but significant challenges in discontinued operations impacting overall profitability.

1. **EBIT Growth**: The EBIT increased by €115 million, from €713 million to €828 million, indicating strong operational performance.
   
2. **Tax and EBT Dynamics**: Despite an increase in income taxes by €82 million (from −€216 million to −€298 million), the EBT rose by €133 million, from €576 million to €709 million, reflecting improved earnings before tax.

3. **Discontinued Operations Impact**: A significant drop in profit or loss from discontinued operations by €504 million (from −€22 million to −€526 million) contributed to the overall loss for the period.

4. **Net Financial Result Improvement**: The net financial result improved by €18 million, from −€137 million to −€119 million, driven by better interest income/expenses and a positive shift in other financial results.
