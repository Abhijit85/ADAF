=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial data for FY18 and FY19 shows an increase in both Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and Profit or loss for the period from continuing operations, despite a negative income tax in FY19. 
1. The EBIT increased by €115 million from €713 million in FY17/18 to €828 million in FY18/19, representing a percentage change of 16.13%. 
2. The Profit or loss for the period from continuing operations also increased from €359 million in FY17/18 to €411 million in FY18/19. However, the components considered for this calculation are not specified in the table. 
3. The income tax for FY19 was negative, amounting to €-298 million. The reason for this is not provided in the context. 
4. The net financial result, which includes the interest result and the other financial result, improved significantly due to better refinancing terms, although the exact figures are not mentioned. 
5. There was an adjustment of the values in FY18, but the table does not provide details about this adjustment.
