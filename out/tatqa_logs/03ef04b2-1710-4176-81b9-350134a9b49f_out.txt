=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The fair value of derivative liabilities saw significant changes between 2018 and 2019, with an overall increase of approximately 313%. 
1. In 2018, the fair value of cross currency swaps was recorded at 1429. However, the context does not provide a comparison for this value in 2019.
2. The fair value of derivatives non-current liability saw a substantial increase in 2019, reaching a value of 41837. No comparative value for 2018 is provided in the context.
3. The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts was higher in 2018, with a recorded value of 1467. Again, no comparative value for 2019 is provided.
4. The fair value of interest rate swaps saw a significant increase from 2018 to 2019, rising by 40695 from 9196 to 49891.
5. Overall, the total fair value of derivative liabilities increased by approximately 313% from 2018 to 2019, as calculated from the given values (49932 in 2019 from 12092 in 2018).
