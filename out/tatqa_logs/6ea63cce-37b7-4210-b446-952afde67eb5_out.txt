=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Investments in associates experienced significant fluctuations and impairments in 2019, with a notable decrease in total investment and an increase in foreign exchange losses. 
1. The total investment in associates saw an increase of £0.8m from 1 January 2018 to 1 January 2019, marking a growth of approximately 1.2%. 
2. However, the total investment experienced a sharp decrease of £11.9m from 31 December 2018 to 31 December 2019, a decline of approximately -18.1%. 
3. An impairment of £7.4m was recorded in 2019, a significant change from 2018 when no impairment was reported. This was triggered by the market price per share of Prozone being lower than its carrying value, valuing the Group’s interest at £9.9 million, significantly lower than the pre-impairment carrying value of £41.5 million.
4. Foreign exchange movements also contributed to the financial changes in 2019, with a loss of £4.2m, a substantial increase from the £1.5m loss in 2018.
