=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of the financial data reveals significant trends and anomalies in lease obligations and contractual commitments over recent years.

1. **Decreasing Trends**: Operating leases have decreased significantly from $7111 in 2021-2022 to $3686 in 2023-2024, contributing to a reduction in total contractual obligations from $7299 to $3936 over the same period.

2. **Lease Composition**: Operating leases made up a substantial portion of total contractual obligations in 2020, with $4143 out of $4170, highlighting their importance in the company's financial commitments during that year.

3. **Capital Lease Proportion**: Capital leases represent a minimal fraction of total contractual obligations, with only $65 out of $19902, indicating their limited impact on the overall financial structure.

4. **Data Anomalies**: The absence of asset retirement obligation amounts from 2020 onwards and missing capital lease data for 2023-2024 suggest potential gaps in the dataset, which may require further investigation to ensure comprehensive financial analysis.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Operating leases show a decrease from 2021-2022 to 2023-2024: $7,111 → $3,686.
- [RATIO] Capital leases are a very small portion of total contractual obligations: $65 out of $19,902.
- [ANOMALY] Asset retirement obligation has no amount listed for 2020 and thereafter, which may indicate incomplete data.
- [OUTLIER] Operating leases for 2021-2022 are significantly higher than other periods: $7,111 compared to $4,143 in 2020 and $3,686 in 2023-2024.
- [TREND] Total contractual obligations decrease from 2021-2022 to 2023-2024: $7,299 → $3,936.
- [RATIO] Operating leases constitute a large portion of total contractual obligations in 2020: $4,143 out of $4,170.
- [ANOMALY] Capital leases have no amounts listed for 2023-2024 and thereafter, suggesting potential missing data.
- [DEFINITION] "Operating lease obligations" exclude "contractually binding sub-lease arrangements".
- [NOTE] A $1.1 million liability for "unrecognized income tax positions" is not in the table.
- [SCOPE] The unrecognized tax positions' cash outflow timing is "not reasonably determinable".
- [SOURCE] Additional lease details are in "Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies".
- [SOURCE] Further tax position information is in "Note 10, Income Taxes".
- [WARNING] The reserve for tax positions is in "Other non-current liabilities".
