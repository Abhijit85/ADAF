=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The table provides a detailed overview of the allowance for doubtful accounts for the years 2017, 2018, and 2019, highlighting key anomalies, trends, and ratios. 
1. There were notable anomalies in the data, with the bad debt expense in 2019 being $(1.6) million and the ending balance in 2017 being $(1.9) million. 
2. The table also revealed significant trends, such as the change in Write-offs, net of recoveries, which increased by 0.4 million from 2018 to 2019 (1.2 to 1.6 million). Additionally, the beginning balance decreased by 0.3 million from 2017 to 2018 ($(2.2) to $(1.9) million).
3. The percentage change in the ending balance between 2017 and 2018 was 31.58%, indicating a substantial shift.
4. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management's estimate of uncollectible balances, determined by known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other available evidence. Trade receivables are written off when the likelihood of collection is considered remote. 
5. Without the actual table, it's impossible to answer the specific questions about bad debt expense, ending balance, and changes in write-offs or beginning balance.
