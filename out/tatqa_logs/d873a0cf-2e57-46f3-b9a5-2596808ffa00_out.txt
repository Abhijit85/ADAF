=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of rights data from 2018 to 2019 reveals significant shifts in outstanding, granted, vested, and lapsed rights, highlighting trends and anomalies in executive compensation practices.

1. Outstanding rights saw a notable increase of 2785164, rising from 10692594 to 13477758, indicating a substantial expansion in the rights offered to executives and key employees.
2. Rights granted decreased by 1226114, from 5691731 to 4465617, suggesting a more selective approach in awarding new rights or a shift in compensation strategy.
3. Vested rights experienced a significant drop of 404062, from 586663 to 182601, which may reflect stricter vesting conditions or changes in employment retention.
4. The ratio of rights granted to rights lapsed in 2019 was approximately 2.98, while the ratio of rights vested to rights lapsed was about 0.12, indicating a higher rate of rights lapsing compared to those vesting, potentially due to unmet service or performance conditions.
