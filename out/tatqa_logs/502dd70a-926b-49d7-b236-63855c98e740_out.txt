=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's total gross emissions (Scope 1 and 2) decreased from 98725 tonnes CO2e in FY18 to 87128 tonnes CO2e in FY19, with Scope 1 emissions accounting for 59495 tonnes CO2e in FY19. 

1. The company's total gross emissions (Scope 1 and 2) saw a significant reduction of approximately 11597 tonnes CO2e from FY18 to FY19. 
2. The combustion of fuel and operation of facilities (Scope 1) contributed to 59495 tonnes CO2e of the total emissions in FY19. However, the change in Scope 1 emissions from FY18 to FY19 for UK and Ireland specifically could not be determined due to lack of region-specific data.
3. The average electricity, heat, steam, and cooling purchased for own use (Scope 2) for FY18 and FY19, as well as the change in the Green tariff from FY18 to FY19 for UK and Ireland, could not be determined due to the same data limitation.
4. The reduction in emissions was attributed to energy efficiency, reduced emissions from refrigerants, a reduction in UK grid carbon factor, and the closure of the Evercreech desserts facility. The company also moved to a certified green tariff renewable electricity supply contract, further contributing to the decrease in emissions.
