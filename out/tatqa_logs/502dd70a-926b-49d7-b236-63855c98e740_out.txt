=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of emissions data from FY18** to FY19 reveals significant reductions in both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, contributing to a substantial decrease in total net emissions.

1. Scope 1 emissions decreased by 6841 tonnes CO2e, from 66336 to 59495, while Scope 2 emissions saw a reduction of 4756 tonnes CO2e, from 32389 to 27633, indicating effective emission control measures.
   
2. The introduction of a green tariff in FY19 played a crucial role, reducing net emissions by 27603 tonnes CO2e, highlighting the impact of renewable energy initiatives.

3. Total gross emissions decreased by 11597 tonnes CO2e, from 98725 to 87128, and total net emissions saw a more dramatic reduction of 39200 tonnes CO2e, from 98725 to 59525, underscoring the overall effectiveness of the emissions reduction strategy.

4. Emissions per £1 sales revenue improved, decreasing from 0.066 in FY18** to 0.060 in FY19, reflecting enhanced operational efficiency and sustainability efforts.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Scope 1 emissions decreased by 6,841 tonnes CO2e from FY18** to FY19 (66,336→59,495).
- [TREND] Scope 2 emissions decreased by 4,756 tonnes CO2e from FY18** to FY19 (32,389→27,633).
- [TREND] Total gross emissions decreased by 11,597 tonnes CO2e from FY18** to FY19 (98,725→87,128).
- [ANOMALY] Green tariff introduced in FY19, reducing net emissions by 27,603 tonnes CO2e.
- [OUTLIER] Scope 2 emissions in FY18*** were significantly higher at 67,754 tonnes CO2e compared to FY18** and FY19.
- [RATIO] Emissions per £1 sales revenue decreased from 0.066 in FY18** to 0.060 in FY19.
- [TREND] Total net emissions decreased by 39,200 tonnes CO2e from FY18** to FY19 (98,725→59,525).
- [DEFINITION] "Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions" refer to direct and indirect emissions from operations.
- [SCOPE] The data covers "UK & Ireland only – comparable with FY19 Group structure."
- [SOURCE] Emissions calculated using "GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard."
