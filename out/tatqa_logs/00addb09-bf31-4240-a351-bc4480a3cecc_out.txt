=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial performance shows mixed results, with sales growth overshadowed by declining profitability metrics.

1. Sales increased by 5.0% to $8.7 billion, with a normalized growth of 3.2%, partly boosted by New Year’s Day, which contributed an 84 bps increase in H2 sales.
2. Despite higher sales, EBITDA decreased by 4.1% to 579 million, and EBIT fell by 8.2% to 474 million, influenced by a $21 million Summergate impairment.
3. Depreciation and amortisation rose significantly by 20.1% to 105 million, contributing to the decline in EBIT and indicating increased capital expenditure or asset write-downs.
4. Profitability metrics weakened, with the gross margin decreasing by 16 bps to 22.9% and the EBIT to sales ratio dropping by 78 bps to 5.5%, reflecting higher operational costs and reduced efficiency in converting sales to profit.
