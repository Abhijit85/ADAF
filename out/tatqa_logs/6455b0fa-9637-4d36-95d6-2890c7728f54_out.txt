=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The notes provide an overview of the defined benefit plans for Rofin-Sinar Laser, GmbH (RSL) and Rofin-Sinar Inc. (RS Inc.) employees, highlighting the costs, changes, and amendments made over the years. 
1. The service cost in 2019 was $1955, while the interest cost for the same year was the highest at $1308, compared to $1230 in 2018. 
2. There was a significant increase in Recognized net actuarial (gain) loss in 2019 from 2018, with a rise of $230, representing a percentage change of approximately 95.83%. 
3. The pension plans, which began in fiscal 1995 for the U.S. plan and are unfunded for the German plan, have undergone several amendments, including the exclusion of new employees hired after specific dates and highly compensated employees. 
4. The notes also warn that any actual results differing from the actuarial assumptions would impact future expense recognition and the cash funding requirements of the defined benefit plans.
