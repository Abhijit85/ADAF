=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's receivables policy and balance for the years 2018 and 2019 show a decrease in billed receivables and an increase in accrued receivables. 
1. Billed receivables decreased by $25621 from $239275 in 2018 to $213654 in 2019, indicating a reduction in the amount of revenue recognized after invoicing.
2. Accrued receivables, which represent revenue recognized before invoicing, increased by $62444 from $336858 in 2018 to $399302 in 2019. This suggests an increase in the company's future billing potential.
3. The total receivables, which include both billed and future billings, increased by approximately 6.52% from $537192 in 2018 to $572238 in 2019. This overall increase in receivables could be attributed to the significant rise in accrued receivables.
4. Despite the decrease in billed receivables, the company's financial health appears to be improving, as indicated by the increase in total receivables. However, the context does not provide specific numbers for billed or accrued receivables for 2018 and 2019, nor the percentage change in total receivables, net between 2018 and 2019.
