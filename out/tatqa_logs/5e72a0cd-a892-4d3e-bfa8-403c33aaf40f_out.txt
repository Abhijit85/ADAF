=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals significant changes in the company's financial position, with notable shifts in liabilities, assets, and equity.

1. Accounts receivable, net increased by $51 (from $657 to $708), indicating a rise in outstanding customer payments, which could impact cash flow if not managed effectively.
2. Retained earnings saw a significant increase of $247 (from $686 to $933), contributing substantially to the overall rise in total stockholders’ equity by $242, highlighting strong profitability or retained profits.
3. Total liabilities decreased by $128 (from $10328 to $10200), a notable reduction that may improve the company's leverage and financial stability.
4. Short-term contract liabilities decreased by $117 (from $2437 to $2320), and long-term contract liabilities decreased by $101 (from $837 to $736), suggesting a shift in the company's contractual obligations and potential changes in revenue recognition practices.
