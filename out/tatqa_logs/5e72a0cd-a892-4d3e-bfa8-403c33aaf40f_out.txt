=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The adoption of the new authoritative guidance for revenue by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in May 2014 has led to significant changes in financial metrics for fiscal 2019. 
1. The adoption of the new standard resulted in an increase in Total assets by approximately 0.72% ($114 million / $15824 million * 100). 
2. Total stockholders’ equity also saw an increase of approximately 4.4% ($242 million / $5496 million * 100) after the adoption of the new standard. 
3. The new standard had a significant impact on Retained earnings, which increased by approximately 36% ($247 million / $686 million * 100). 
4. The new guidance also affected the company's deferred commissions, increasing short-term deferred commissions to $92 million and long-term deferred commissions to $93 million. Without the adoption of the new standard, these figures would have been lower. 
5. Despite these changes, the Accounts receivable, net as reported as of March 29, 2019, remained at $708 million.
