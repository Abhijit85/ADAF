=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Total emissions have decreased significantly, reflecting improved environmental efficiency and performance.

1. Total emissions dropped by 301.9 tonnes of CO2e, from 5087.6 to 4785.7, marking a 6.14% reduction since 2018 and a 29% decrease from the 2014 baseline.
2. Scope 1 emissions saw a slight increase of 7.5 tonnes of CO2e, rising from 137.2 to 144.7, while Scope 2 emissions decreased by 309.4 tonnes of CO2e, from 4950.4 to 4641.0.
3. Efficiency improvements are evident as emissions per full-time equivalent (FTE) employee decreased by 0.11, from 3.57 to 3.46, and emissions per square metre reduced by 0.011, from 0.125 to 0.114.
4. Emissions per $ million of revenues decreased by 1.17, from 10.67 to 9.50, a 10.9% reduction, indicating enhanced operational efficiency and a Climate Change rating improvement from C to B, surpassing the sector average of C.
