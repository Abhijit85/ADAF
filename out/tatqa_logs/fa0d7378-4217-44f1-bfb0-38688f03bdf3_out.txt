=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals a significant improvement in profitability despite a decline in net sales.

1. **Net Sales Decline**: There was a decrease in net sales by $311.3 million, from $5875.0 million to $5563.7 million, indicating a contraction in revenue.
   
2. **Net Income Turnaround**: Net income saw a remarkable improvement, shifting from a loss of $(762.3) million to a profit of $542.0 million, marking a significant turnaround in financial performance.

3. **Earnings Per Share Growth**: Basic net income per common share increased by $5.56, from $(3.27) to $2.29, while diluted net income per common share rose by $5.44, from $(3.27) to $2.17, reflecting enhanced shareholder value.

4. **Contextual Insight**: The results, presented for informational purposes, suggest that despite lower sales, strategic adjustments or cost efficiencies may have driven the profitability shift, though they are not indicative of actual results if the acquisition had occurred on April 1, 2017.
