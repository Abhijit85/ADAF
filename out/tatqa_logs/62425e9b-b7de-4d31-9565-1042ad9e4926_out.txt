=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's effective tax rate from 2017 to 2019 was influenced by various factors including statutory federal income tax, state income taxes, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, and others. 

1. The amount computed at the statutory federal income tax rate varied over the years, with $138 million in 2017, $128 million in 2018, and $182 million in 2020. Notably, the amount in 2018 was less than $150 million.
2. State income taxes, net of federal tax benefit, also fluctuated, decreasing by $21 million from 2017 to 2018, and reaching $22 million in 2020.
3. The average excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation in 2017 and 2018 was $10.5 million. These benefits refer to gains from employee stock-based payment transactions and can lower the effective tax rate.
4. Other factors impacting the effective tax rate include research and development credits, changes in valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, and the impact of foreign operations. However, specific amounts for these factors were not provided in the context. 

It's important to note that the Tax Act in 2017 reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which likely influenced these figures.
