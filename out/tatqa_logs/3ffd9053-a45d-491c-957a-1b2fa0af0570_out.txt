=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's total sales in 2019 reached $1496.5, with contract types being Fixed Price and Other, and no information provided on cost-plus type contracts. 
1. The company's total sales in 2019 were the highest recorded, amounting to $1496.5. This indicates a successful year for the company in terms of sales.
2. The company operates under two types of contracts: Fixed Price, where work is performed for a predetermined sales price, and Other. There is no information provided on cost-plus type contracts, where the company is paid its allowable incurred costs plus a profit.
3. There was a decrease in the 'Other' contract type in 2019 from 2018, with a change of -$12.6 ($56.7→$44.1). This represents a percentage change of -22.2% (($56.7-$44.1)/$56.7), suggesting a significant drop in this type of contract.
4. The context does not provide specific total sales figures, the year with the largest total sales, or any information on the change in 'Other' contracts in 2019 from 2018. This lack of data limits the depth of analysis that can be performed.
