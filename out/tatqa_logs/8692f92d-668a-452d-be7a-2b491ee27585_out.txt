=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of the tax data reveals significant fluctuations and trends in both current and deferred tax expenses across different regions.

1. **Consistent Increase in Current Tax Expense**: The total current tax expense has shown a steady increase over the periods, rising from €950 million to €1018 million, and then to €1062 million, indicating a growing tax burden.

2. **Significant Anomalies in Deferred Tax**: The United Kingdom's deferred tax shifted dramatically from a credit of €(16) million to an expense of €39 million, and then to a credit of €(232) million, highlighting volatility in tax liabilities.

3. **Extreme Fluctuations in Overseas Deferred Tax**: Overseas deferred tax experienced significant swings, with figures moving from €3830 million to a negative €(1936) million, and then to €666 million, suggesting instability in international tax positions.

4. **Overall Income Tax Expense Variability**: The total income tax expense transitioned from a substantial credit of €4764 million to an expense of €1496 million, reflecting major changes in tax obligations over the periods.

- [DEFINITION] "Income tax expense represents the sum of the current and deferred taxes."
- [SCOPE] Deferred tax is based on "temporary differences between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities."
- [SOURCE] Tax rates used are those "enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date."
- [NOTE] "Tax is charged or credited to the income statement" unless related to other comprehensive income or equity.
