=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial performance from 2017 to 2019 shows a steady increase in net income and earnings per share, alongside a notable reduction in dilutive potential common shares.

1. **Net Income Growth**: The company experienced a consistent rise in net income, increasing from $3847839 in 2017 to $4566156 in 2019, indicating robust financial health and operational efficiency.

2. **Earnings Per Share (EPS) Improvement**: Both basic and diluted EPS improved over the three years, moving from $0.28 in 2017 to $0.34 in 2019, reflecting enhanced profitability per share.

3. **Reduction in Dilutive Shares**: There was a significant decrease in dilutive potential common shares, dropping from 128431 in 2017 to just 8343 in 2019, which suggests a more favorable equity structure for existing shareholders.

4. **Advertising Costs**: Advertising expenses showed a slight increase from $365859 in 2018 to $378217 in 2019, which may have contributed to the revenue growth and improved net income.
