=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial data from 2017 to 2019 reveals significant fluctuations in restaurant operations and financial metrics, highlighting both growth opportunities and challenges.

1. **Restaurant Openings and Closures**: The number of new restaurants opened by franchisees fluctuated, with 18 in 2017, dropping to 11 in 2018, and rising again to 19 in 2019, indicating variable expansion efforts.

2. **Cash Proceeds Decline**: Cash proceeds experienced a dramatic decline from $99591 in 2017 to $26486 in 2018, and further to $1280 in 2019, reflecting a significant reduction in liquidity.

3. **Net Asset Sales and Gains**: Net assets sold were negative in 2017 and 2018, at $(30597) and $(21329) respectively, suggesting potential losses, while gains on the sale of company-operated restaurants increased from $38034 in 2017 to $46164 in 2018, before plummeting to $1366 in 2019.

4. **Additional Proceeds from Franchise Extensions**: Additional proceeds from franchise extensions were $1.3M in 2019, $1.4M in 2018, and $0.2M in 2017, indicating a growing reliance on franchise extensions for revenue.
