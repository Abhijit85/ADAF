=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The average life expectancy for a male member aged 65 decreased slightly from 87.3 years in 2018 to 86.8 years in 2019. 
1. The average life expectancy for a male member aged 65 in 2019 was 86.8 years, showing a decrease from the previous year's average of 87.3 years. 
2. This represents a decrease of 0.5 years or approximately -0.57% from 2018 to 2019. 
3. The mortality rates used to calculate these averages are based on the nationally published mortality table S2NA with CMI 2018 projections. 
4. The assumptions used in these calculations apply to "members’ years of birth" with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.5% per annum. However, the context does not provide specific data on the average life expectancy for a pensioner retiring at age 65 in 2019 or any other year.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] The average life expectancy for a male member aged 65 in 2019 was 86.8 years
- [TREND] The average life expectancy for a pensioner retiring at age 65 is provided for the years 2018 and 2019
- [ANOMALY] The average life expectancy for a male member aged 65 was higher in 2018, with a value of 87.3 years
- [TREND] The change in the average life expectancy for a male member aged 65 in 2019 from 2018 was a decrease of 0.5 years (87.3→86.8)
- [RATIO] The percentage change in the average life expectancy for a male member aged 65 in 2019 from 2018 was approximately -0.57%
