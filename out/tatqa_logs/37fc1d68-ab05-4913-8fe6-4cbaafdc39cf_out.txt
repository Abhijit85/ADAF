=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Recent data indicates a decline in life expectancy for both men and women aged 65 and 45, with women consistently outliving men.

1. Men aged 65 have experienced a decrease in life expectancy by 0.5 years, from 87.3 to 86.8 years, while women in the same age group saw a reduction of 0.4 years, from 89.3 to 88.9 years.
2. For individuals aged 45, the life expectancy at age 65 has also decreased, with men seeing a decline of 0.5 years (from 89.0 to 88.5 years) and women a decrease of 0.4 years (from 91.1 to 90.7 years).
3. Despite these declines, women maintain a higher life expectancy than men, with a consistent gap of 2.1 years for those aged 65 in 2019 (88.9 vs 86.8) and 2.2 years for those aged 45 in 2019 (90.7 vs 88.5).
4. These trends are based on the nationally published mortality table S2NA with CMI 2018 projections, assuming a 1.5% annual improvement rate.

- [TREND] Women aged 45 life expectancy at age 65 ↓0.4 years (91.1→90.7)
- [RATIO] Women aged 65 have consistently higher life expectancy than men by 2.1 years in 2019 (88.9 vs 86.8) and 2.0 years in 2018 (89.3 vs 87.3)
- [RATIO] Women aged 45 have consistently higher life expectancy at age 65 than men by 2.2 years in 2019 (90.7 vs 88.5) and 2.1 years in 2018 (91.1 vs 89.0)
- [DEFINITION] Mortality is based on "nationally published mortality table S2NA with CMI 2018 projections".
- [SCOPE] Assumptions apply to "members’ years of birth" with a 1.5% annual improvement rate.
- [NOTE] Life expectancy is calculated for a pensioner retiring at age 65.
- [SCOPE] 50% of non-retired members will commute maximum cash at retirement.
- [SOURCE] The assumptions are consistent with the 2018 data for cash commutation.
