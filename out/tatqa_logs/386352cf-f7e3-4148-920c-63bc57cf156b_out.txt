=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial data for the fiscal year ending February 28, 2019, shows a higher total in assets than liabilities and stockholders' equity, with significant amounts in deferred income tax assets and deferred revenue. 
1. The total assets reported were $64509, which included $22626 in deferred income tax assets, $19373 in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and $22510 in other assets. 
2. The total liabilities and stockholders' equity reported were $60513, which included $24264 in deferred revenue and $38476 in other non-current liabilities, offset by an accumulated deficit of $2227.
3. The difference between deferred revenue and other non-current liabilities was $14212.
4. The adoption of ASC 606 had a minor impact on the deferred income tax assets, with a difference of $532 between the reported figure and the figure without the adoption of ASC 606. The impact of adopting ASC 606 on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the fiscal year was immaterial.
5. The balances as of February 28, 2019, included "deferred revenue of TRACKER", which was acquired on February 25, 2019, and "Deferred product costs" amounting to $6.2 million and $8.8 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets, respectively.
