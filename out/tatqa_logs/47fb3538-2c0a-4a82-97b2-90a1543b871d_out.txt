=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's audit and related fees experienced significant changes from 2018 to 2019. 
1. The Statutory Audit, Certification, Audit of Individual and Consolidated Financial Statements saw a decrease of Δ451500, dropping from 4556500 in 2018 to 4105000 in 2019. This indicates a reduction in the company's audit activities or a more efficient audit process.
2. In contrast, Audit-Related Fees, which include assurance and related fees for audits of employee benefit plans, due diligence services, and certain agreed-upon procedures, increased by Δ35071, from 173934 in 2018 to 209005 in 2019. This suggests an increase in these specific audit-related activities.
3. Despite the increase in Audit-Related Fees, the Total Fees, which include Audit Fees, Audit-related services, and Tax Fees, decreased by Δ416429, from 4730434 in 2018 to 4314005 in 2019. This overall decrease could be due to reductions in other areas not specified in the provided data.
4. It's important to note that the context does not provide specific reasons for these changes, and further investigation would be needed to fully understand the factors contributing to these trends.
