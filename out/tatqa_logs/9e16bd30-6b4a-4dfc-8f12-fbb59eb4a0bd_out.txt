=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's share capital experienced significant changes in 2019, primarily driven by a substantial share buy-back initiative.

1. The share capital balance decreased by 55.6 million shares, from 1313.3 million to 1258.7 million, reflecting a reduction in the total number of shares outstanding.
2. A notable share buy-back occurred on May 27, 2019, involving 58.7 million shares at a cost of $282 million, which was executed at a 14% discount to the market price of $33.64, with shares bought at $28.94 each.
3. The buy-back included a fully franked dividend of $24.15 per share, with a capital component of $4.79 per share, and the shares were subsequently cancelled, impacting the overall share capital value, which decreased by $168 million, from $6201 million to $6033 million.
4. The contributed equity at the end of the period decreased by $227 million, from $6055 million to $5828 million, indicating a reduction in the company's equity base due to the buy-back and other share capital adjustments.
