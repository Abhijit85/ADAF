=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The table provides financial data on the Group's defined contribution and benefit schemes, but lacks information on the 2019 averages and the countries of operation for these schemes. 

1. The financial items listed include 'Defined contribution schemes', 'Defined benefit schemes', and 'Total amount charged to income statement (note 23)'. However, the table does not provide the 2019 average for these schemes, which is a significant omission for a comprehensive understanding of the Group's financial performance.
2. The difference between the 2019 defined contribution schemes and 2019 defined benefit schemes is €109m (€166m - €57m). This indicates a higher financial commitment towards defined contribution schemes in that year.
3. The Group operates defined benefit schemes in several countries including Germany, Ghana, India, Ireland, Italy, the UK, and the United States. However, the table does not specify the countries where these schemes are operated.
4. The Group also operates defined benefit indemnity plans in Greece and Turkey, but again, this information is not reflected in the table. This lack of geographical data limits the scope of analysis for the Group's global financial operations.
