=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of Vodafone's pension scheme expenses reveals contrasting trends between defined contribution and defined benefit schemes, with implications for financial strategy and risk management.

1. Defined contribution schemes show a consistent decrease in expenses from 192 in 2017 to 166 in 2019, indicating a potential reduction in financial burden over time.
2. Conversely, defined benefit schemes have seen a significant increase in expenses, rising from 20 in 2017 to 57 in 2019, highlighting growing financial liabilities and exposure to actuarial risks.
3. Despite these fluctuations, the total amount charged to the income statement remains stable, with only a slight increase from 212 in 2017 to 223 in 2019, suggesting effective overall cost management.
4. The sharp 120% increase in defined benefit expenses from 20 in 2017 to 44 in 2018 underscores the need for strategic focus on managing these liabilities, particularly given the exposure to risks such as longevity and inflation.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Defined contribution schemes expenses show a decreasing trend: 192 (2017) → 178 (2018) → 166 (2019).
- [TREND] Defined benefit schemes expenses show an increasing trend: 20 (2017) → 44 (2018) → 57 (2019).
- [RATIO] In 2019, defined contribution schemes expenses (166) are nearly three times the defined benefit schemes expenses (57).
- [RATIO] In 2017, defined contribution schemes expenses (192) are almost ten times the defined benefit schemes expenses (20).
- [ANOMALY] Total amount charged to income statement remains relatively stable: 212 (2017) → 222 (2018) → 223 (2019), despite fluctuations in individual scheme expenses.
- [OUTLIER] The increase in defined benefit schemes from 20 (2017) to 44 (2018) represents a 120% increase, which is a significant jump compared to other changes.
