=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's other operating expenses and net losses on sales or disposals of assets experienced significant changes between 2018 and 2019. 

1. In 2018, the total other operating expenses were $513.3 million, which significantly decreased by approximately 67.6% to $27.0 million in 2019. This drastic reduction could be attributed to various factors such as cost-cutting measures, reduced impairment charges, or fewer losses on sales or disposals of assets.
   
2. The net losses on sales or disposals of assets increased in 2019 to $45.1 million. This could be due to the sale or disposal of non-core towers, other assets, and miscellaneous items at a loss.
   
3. In 2019, two expense segments, namely impairment charges and net losses on sales or disposals of assets, were above $50 million. This indicates a significant portion of the company's expenses were due to asset write-downs and losses from asset sales or disposals.
   
4. In contrast, in 2018, only one expense segment, other operating expenses, was below $100 million. This suggests that the company had a more diversified expense structure in 2018 compared to 2019.
