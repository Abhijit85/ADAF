=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's financial statements for the years ending December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2018, reveal a decrease in interest expense and an increase in interest income, alongside fluctuations in other income and expenses. 

1. The interest expense, which is the cost of borrowing money, decreased by $1258 from $3343 in 2017 to $2085 in 2018. This reduction was attributed to lower debt balances, a decrease in interest related to interest rate swaps, and a one-time charge related to a liability settled in 2017.
2. Interest income exceeded $1500 thousand in both 2017 and 2018, with an increase in 2018 due to higher interest rates.
3. The net total of other expenses and income in 2017 was $1758. However, in 2018, other expenses were driven by foreign currency translation losses, primarily due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar against the Chinese Renminbi and the Euro.
4. The percentage change in the net total of other expenses and income between 2017 and 2018 was 66.86%. This fluctuation was mainly due to foreign currency translation gains in 2017, resulting from the depreciation of the U.S. Dollar against the Chinese Renminbi and the Euro.
