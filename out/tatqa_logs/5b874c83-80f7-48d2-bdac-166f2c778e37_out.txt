=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In the financial analysis of the years ending December 31, 2017, and 2018, significant shifts in interest and other income/expenses were observed.

1. Interest expense decreased significantly by $1258, from $3343 in 2017 to $2085 in 2018, primarily due to lower debt and reduced interest from swaps.
2. Interest income increased by $542, from $1284 in 2017 to $1826 in 2018, driven by higher interest rates, improving the interest income to expense ratio from 0.38 to 0.88.
3. A notable anomaly was the shift in other (expense) income, which moved from a positive $3817 in 2017 to a negative $(2676) in 2018, largely due to foreign currency translation losses.
4. Total other (expense) income, net, also experienced a significant change, moving from a positive $1758 in 2017 to a negative $(2935) in 2018, reflecting a $4693 decline.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Interest expense decreased significantly by $1,258 ($3,343→$2,085).
