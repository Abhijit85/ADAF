                       'Adjusted Gross Margin. Adjusted gross margin '
                       'represents gross profit plus amortization of acquired '
                       'intangibles and stock-based compensation. Adjusted '
                       'gross margin is a measure used by management to '
                       'understand and evaluate our core operating performance '
                       'and trends and to generate future operating plans. The '
