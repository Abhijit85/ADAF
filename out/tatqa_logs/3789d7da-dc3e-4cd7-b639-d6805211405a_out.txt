=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Teekay Corporation's operations, divided among Teekay LNG, Teekay Tankers, and Teekay Parent, saw significant revenue increases in its LNG and Tankers divisions from 2018 to 2019. 
1. Teekay LNG's revenue saw a substantial increase of 90494 thousands of U.S. dollars, rising from 510762 thousands of U.S. dollars in 2018 to 601256 thousands of U.S. dollars in 2019.
