=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of compensation trends from 2017 to 2019 reveals a decrease in total compensation and changes in incentive structures.

1. **Incentive Schemes**: There was a decrease in incentive schemes by 1 €m from 2018 to 2019, dropping from 3 €m to 2 €m, which also affected the incentive schemes to total compensation ratio, reducing it from 37.5% in 2018 to 33.3% in 2019.

2. **Total Compensation**: Total compensation decreased by 2 €m from 2018 to 2019, moving from 8 €m to 6 €m, indicating a broader reduction in compensation components.

3. **Salaries and Fees Stability**: Salaries and fees remained constant at 4 €m across 2017, 2018, and 2019, highlighting stability in this component despite other fluctuations.

4. **Missing Benefits**: Other benefits, which were 1 €m in both 2017 and 2018, are notably absent in 2019, suggesting a potential area for further investigation regarding compensation structure changes.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Incentive schemes decreased by 1 €m from 2018 to 2019 (3→2).
- [ANOMALY] Other benefits are missing in 2019, while they were 1 €m in both 2018 and 2017.

- [OUTLIER] Salaries and fees remained constant at 4 €m across all three years.
- [RATIO] Incentive schemes to total compensation ratio in 2018 was 3/8 or 37.5%.
- [RATIO] Incentive schemes to total compensation ratio in 2019 was 2/6 or 33.3%.
- [DEFINITION] "Aggregate emoluments" exclude gains from long-term incentive plans.
- [NOTE] Cash allowances in lieu of pension contributions are included in compensation.
- [SCOPE] No Directors exercised share options in the year ended 31 March 2019.
