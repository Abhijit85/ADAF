=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The table provides a breakdown of financial items including 'Salaries and fees' and 'Incentive schemes' for the years 2017, 2018, and 2019. 

1. The 'Salaries and fees' for 2019 amounted to €4m, which also represents the average for this category between 2018 and 2019. 
2. The average 'Incentive schemes' between 2018 and 2019 was calculated to be €2.5m. 
3. There was a notable difference of €1.5m between the average 'Salaries and fees' and 'Incentive schemes' from 2018 to 2019. 
4. The table also likely includes 'Other benefits', although specific amounts for this category are not provided in the context. 
5. It's important to note that no Directors exercised share options in the year ended 31 March 2019, which could have influenced the overall compensation details for that year.
