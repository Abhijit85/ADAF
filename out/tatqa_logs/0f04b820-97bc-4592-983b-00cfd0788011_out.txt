=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Total energy and water consumption have increased significantly, with notable variations in specific areas.

1. Total energy consumption rose by 37603.78 MWh, from 167488.48 to 205092.26 MWh, driven by both direct and indirect energy use, with direct energy consumption increasing by 6292.13 MWh and indirect by 31311.65 MWh.
2. Natural gas consumption saw a substantial rise of 6267.37 MWh, from 12029.70 to 18297.07 MWh, indicating a shift towards this energy source.
3. Running water consumption increased by 310336.67 tonnes, from 973413.06 to 1283749.73 tonnes, while recycled water consumption decreased by 1385 tonnes, highlighting a potential area for sustainability improvement.
4. Despite the overall increase in energy consumption, diesel usage slightly decreased by 0.77 MWh, from 42.10 to 41.33 MWh, suggesting a minor shift in energy sourcing strategies.
