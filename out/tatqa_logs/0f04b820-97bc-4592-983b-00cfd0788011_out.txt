=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The total energy consumption for the year ended 31 December 2019 increased significantly compared to the previous year, with notable increases in both direct and indirect energy consumption, as well as running water consumption. 
1. The total energy consumption for the year ended 31 December 2019 was 205092.26 MWh, an increase from 167488.48 MWh in 2018. This represents a significant increase in energy usage year-on-year.
2. Direct energy consumption, which may refer to diesel consumption at data centres directly borne by the Group, also increased from 12852.04 MWh in 2018 to 19144.17 MWh in 2019, a change of Δ6292.13 MWh.
3. Indirect energy consumption saw a substantial increase of Δ31311.65 MWh, from 154636.44 MWh in 2018 to 185948.09 MWh in 2019.
4. Running water consumption at data centres wholly used by the Group also increased significantly, from 973413.06 tonnes in 2018 to 1283749.73 tonnes in 2019, a change of Δ310336.67 tonnes.
5. The scope of use of resources data was expanded in 2019 to include 12 new office buildings, which may have contributed to the overall increase in consumption figures.

Answer Echoes:
- The total energy consumption (MWh) for the year ended 31 December 2019 was 205,092.26
- The total energy consumption (MWh) for the year ended 31 December 2018 was 167,488.48
- The direct energy consumption (MWh) for the year ended 31 December 2019 was 19,144.17
- The change between direct energy consumption (MWh) in 2018 and 2019 year end was Δ6,292.13 (12,852.04→19,144.17)
- The change between indirect energy consumption (MWh) in 2018 and 2019 year end was Δ31,311.65 (154,636.44→185,948.09)
- The change between running water consumption (tonnes) in 2018 and 2019 year end was Δ310,336.67 (973,413.06→1,283,749.73)
- Total energy consumption is calculated using data of purchased electricity and fuel, referencing the PRC National Standards.
- Direct energy consumption might refer to the diesel consumption at data centres directly borne by the Group.
- Running water consumption data only covers data centres wholly used by the Group where operators could provide such data.
- The scope of use of resources data was expanded in 2019 to include 12 new office buildings.
