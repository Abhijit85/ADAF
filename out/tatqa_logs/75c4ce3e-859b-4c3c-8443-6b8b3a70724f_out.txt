=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's financial performance showed significant anomalies and trends in net income, interest expenses, income taxes, and Adjusted EBITDA over the years 2017-2019. 

1. The net income in 2019 was notably high at $53330, and it also exceeded $30000 in 2017, indicating two years of strong profitability.
2. There was an anomaly in the net interest expense, interest income, and other income in 2018, which was reported as 503.
3. The provision for or benefit from income taxes in 2017 was unusually high at 2990.
4. The company's amortization and depreciation expense increased significantly by Δ3987 from 17734 in 2017 to 21721 in 2018.
5. The Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure used by the company's management to evaluate core operating performance, increased by 16.3% between 2018 and 2019, from $93081 to $108307. However, it's important to note that this measure has certain limitations, including not reflecting cash capital expenditure requirements, changes in working capital needs, the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation, tax payments, and differences in calculation methods among companies.
