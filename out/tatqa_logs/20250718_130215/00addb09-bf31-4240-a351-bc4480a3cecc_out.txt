Answer Echoes:
- **What is the gross margin for F19?**
- 22.9%
- **What is the number of stores under Dan Murphy's store network in F19?**
- **Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs**
- **What percentage did Sales increase by between F19 and F18?**
- 5.0% increase
- **What is the nominal difference for ROFE between F19 and F18?**
- ROFE F19 = 15.2%
- ROFE F18 = 17.1%
- Nominal Difference = 17.1% - 15.2% = 1.9%
- **What is the average value for sales per square metre for both F19 and F18?**
- Sales per square metre F19 = $18,675
- Sales per square metre F18 = $18,094
- Average = ($18,675 + $18,094) / 2 = $18,384.50
- **What is the average ROFE for the years F19 and F18?**
- ROFE F19 = 15.2%
- ROFE F18 = 17.1%
- Average ROFE = (15.2% + 17.1%) / 2 = 16.15%
