1. Prepaid expenses and other increased by $495 million, rising from $2083 million to $2578 million, which contributed to a higher percentage of total assets, moving from 53.5% to 57.4%.
   
2. Other assets saw a modest increase of $99 million, from $1812 million to $1911 million, but their share of total assets decreased from 46.5% to 42.6%, indicating a relative decline in their importance within the asset structure.

3. Total assets experienced an overall increase of $594 million, growing from $3895 million to $4489 million, reflecting a robust expansion in the company's asset base.

4. Amortization expenses related to deferred contract costs were substantial, amounting to $2.7 billion in 2019 and $2.0 billion in 2018, highlighting significant ongoing investments in contract-related activities without any impairment charges recognized in 2019 and 2018.
