=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of the accounts receivable data reveals significant changes and anomalies in 2019 compared to 2018.

1. **Billed Accounts Receivable Trend**: There was a notable decrease in billed accounts receivable by $29542, from $156948 in 2018 to $127406 in 2019, indicating a potential decline in billing efficiency or collection processes.

2. **Total Accounts Receivable Outlier**: Total accounts receivable experienced a substantial drop of $272487, from $398501 in 2018 to $126014 in 2019, which may reflect changes in accounting practices or significant write-offs.

3. **Allowance for Doubtful Accounts**: The allowance for doubtful accounts saw a slight increase of $68, from $1324 to $1392, suggesting a minor adjustment in the estimation of uncollectible accounts.

4. **Unbilled Receivables Reclassification**: The reclassification of unbilled receivables as "contract assets" under ASC 606 from October 1, 2018, and the absence of 2019 data, complicates direct year-over-year comparisons and requires careful consideration in financial analysis.
