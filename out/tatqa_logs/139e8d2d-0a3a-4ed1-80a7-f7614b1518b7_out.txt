=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The data provides an overview of the depreciation expense and the value of Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net for the years 2017 to 2019. 
1. The depreciation expense, which is the cost allocated to a tangible asset over its useful life, increased each year from $442 million in 2017 to $510 million in 2019. 
2. The value of Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net also increased from $3497 million in 2018 to $3574 million in 2019, a change of $77 million or approximately 2.2%. 
3. The components of Property, plant, and equipment, gross included Land and improvements ($152 million), Buildings and improvements ($1393 million), Machinery and equipment ($7298 million), and Construction in process ($637 million). 
4. However, the context does not provide information about the components of the Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net or about the change in value of the Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net from 2018 to 2019.

Answer Echoes:
- [ANOMALY] The amount of depreciation expense in 2019 was $5 million ($5,906 million - $5,901 million).
- [TREND] The Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net was calculated for the years 2018 and 2019.
- [RATIO] The components under Property, plant, and equipment, gross were Land and improvements ($152 million), Buildings and improvements ($1,393 million), Machinery and equipment ($7,298 million), and Construction in process ($637 million).
- [OUTLIER] The amount of Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net was larger in 2019 ($3,574 million) than in 2018 ($3,497 million).
- [TREND] The change in Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net in 2019 from 2018 was $77 million ($3,574 million - $3,497 million).
- [RATIO] The percentage change in Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net in 2019 from 2018 was approximately 2.2% (($77 million / $3,497 million) * 100).
