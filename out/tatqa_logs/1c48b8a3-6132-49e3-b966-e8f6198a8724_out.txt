=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial statement reveals notable changes in asset categories, highlighting both growth and anomalies in property and equipment values.

1. Buildings and leasehold improvements saw a substantial increase of $9173, rising from 129582 to 138755, indicating significant investment in infrastructure.
2. Equipment, furniture, and fixtures also grew by $9022, from 298537 to 307559, suggesting ongoing enhancements or expansions in operational capacity.
3. An unusual decrease in land value by $236, from 2185 to 1949, contrasts with typical expectations of land appreciation or stability.
4. A notable reduction in capitalized internally developed software costs by $3417, from 41883 to 38466, stands out as an outlier compared to other asset categories, potentially indicating a shift in software development strategy or write-offs.
5. Accumulated depreciation increased significantly by $26731, from 339658 to 366389, which is substantial relative to the total asset increase of $17303, reflecting accelerated depreciation or aging assets.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Buildings and leasehold improvements increased by $9,173 (129,582→138,755).
- [TREND] Equipment, furniture and fixtures increased by $9,022 (298,537→307,559).
- [TREND] Construction in progress increased significantly by $2,784 (2,253→5,037).
- [ANOMALY] Land decreased by $236 (2,185→1,949), which is unusual as land typically appreciates or remains stable.
- [OUTLIER] Capitalized internally developed software costs decreased by $3,417 (41,883→38,466), which is a notable reduction compared to other asset categories.
- [RATIO] Accumulated depreciation increased by $26,731 (339,658→366,389), which is a significant increase relative to the total asset increase of $17,303 (475,076→492,379).
- [DEFINITION] "Property and equipment, net" refers to tangible assets minus depreciation.
- [NOTE] Figures are presented "in thousands," affecting interpretation of financial scale.
- [SCOPE] Details likely include original cost, depreciation, and net value.
