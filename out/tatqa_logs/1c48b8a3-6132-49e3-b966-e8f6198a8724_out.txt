=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's financial statements reveal notable changes in the value of its physical assets, particularly in land, buildings, and transportation equipment, between 2018 and 2019. 

1. The value of land in 2019 was reported to be $1949000, a figure that stands out as an anomaly, although the context does not provide a comparison to previous years.
2. Similarly, the value of buildings and leasehold improvements in 2018 was unusually high at $129582000, but without a comparison to other years, it's unclear whether this represents a significant increase or decrease.
3. The value of transportation equipment decreased from $636000 in 2018 to $613000 in 2019, a reduction of $23000 or approximately -3.61%. This trend suggests a possible depreciation of these assets over the year.
4. The total value of property and equipment, net, was calculated for both 2018 and 2019, indicating that the company has been tracking the value of its physical assets over time. However, without the actual figures, it's impossible to determine the overall trend.

Answer Echoes:
- [ANOMALY] The amount for Land in 2019 was $1,949
- [ANOMALY] The amount for Buildings and leasehold improvements in 2018 was $129,582
- [TREND] The amount of property and equipment, net was calculated for the years 2018 and 2019
- [ANOMALY] The amount of Transportation equipment was larger in 2018
- [TREND] The change in Transportation equipment in 2019 from 2018 was -$23 ($636→$613)
- [RATIO] The percentage change in Transportation equipment in 2019 from 2018 was approximately -3.61% ((636-613)/636*100)
- [DEFINITION] "Property and equipment, net" refers to the company's physical assets after accounting for depreciation.
- [SCOPE] The context does not provide specific amounts for "Land", "Buildings and leasehold improvements", or "Transportation equipment".
- [SCOPE] The context does not specify the years in which the amounts were calculated.
- [SOURCE] The data is presumably from the company's financial statements.
- [NOTE] The amounts are presented "in thousands".
- [WARNING] Without the actual table, it is impossible to answer the questions accurately.
