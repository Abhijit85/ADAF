=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals a significant deterioration in net financing costs, driven by various adverse factors. 

1. Investment income saw a notable decline of €252 million, dropping from €685 million to €433 million, which negatively impacted overall financial performance.
2. Financing costs surged by €1014 million, increasing from €1074 million to €2088 million, largely due to mark-to-market losses and unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements.
3. The ratio of financing costs to investment income worsened significantly, escalating from 1.57 in 2018 to 4.82 in 2019, indicating a disproportionate increase in costs relative to income.
4. Specific financial activities, including the Liberty Global transaction, contributed to a €1.3 billion increase in net financing costs, despite stable underlying financing costs and consistent average net debt balances.
