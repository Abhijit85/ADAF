=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's financial performance from 2015 to 2019 shows a mixed trend in assets, working capital, and total debt. 
1. The total assets of the company increased by 5.43% between 2015 and 2016, from $632904 to $667235, indicating a period of growth.
2. However, there was a significant decrease in working capital between 2018 and 2019, from $237416 to $207599, a drop of $29817. This could suggest a decrease in the company's short-term financial health.
3. The company's total debt also decreased between 2017 and 2018, from $26700 to $25600, a reduction of $1100. This reduction in debt could indicate improved financial stability.
4. It's important to note that the total debt, which consisted of taxable revenue bonds due to the State of Alabama Industrial Development Authority, was fully repaid by January 2, 2020. This repayment could further enhance the company's financial position.
