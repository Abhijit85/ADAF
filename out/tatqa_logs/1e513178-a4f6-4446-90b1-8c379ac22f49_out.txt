=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals a consistent decline in key financial metrics, indicating potential challenges in the company's financial health.

1. **Working Capital Decline**: Working capital has decreased from $306296 in 2017 to $207599 in 2019, suggesting reduced liquidity and operational efficiency over the years.

2. **Asset Reduction**: Total assets have significantly decreased from $669094 in 2017 to $545118 in 2019, pointing to a potential reduction in company resources and investment capacity.

3. **Equity and Debt Trends**: Stockholders’ equity fell sharply from $497911 in 2017 to $380426 in 2019, with a notable drop between 2018 and 2019, possibly due to significant losses or distributions. Meanwhile, total debt decreased from $28900 in 2015 to $24600 in 2019, improving the debt-to-equity ratio from 0.060 to 0.065.

4. **Debt Repayment**: The company repaid its taxable revenue bonds in full on January 2, 2020, which may positively impact future financial stability.
