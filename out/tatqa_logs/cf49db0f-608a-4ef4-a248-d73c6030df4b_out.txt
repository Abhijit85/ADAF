=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The asset allocation report as of December 31, 2018, reveals significant growth in total segment assets, with notable changes across various categories.

1. Total segment assets increased by $572.5 million, from $4188.2 million to $4760.7 million, indicating robust growth across the board.
2. Product Care assets saw a substantial rise of $489.1 million, moving from $2273.8 million to $2762.9 million, highlighting a major area of asset expansion.
3. Food Care assets experienced a more modest increase of $83.4 million, from $1914.4 million to $1997.8 million, although an understatement of $372.9 million was noted, offset by adjustments in Product Care and unallocated assets.
4. Despite the overall growth, income tax receivables decreased significantly by $25.6 million, from $58.4 million to $32.8 million, which stands out as a notable reduction amidst the general upward trend.
