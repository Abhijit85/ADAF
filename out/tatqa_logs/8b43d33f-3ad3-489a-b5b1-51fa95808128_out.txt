=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of restricted investments as of December 31, 2019, reveals significant shifts in unrealized gains and losses, particularly in foreign and U.S. government obligations.

1. **Foreign Government Obligations**: The amortized cost of foreign government obligations increased significantly from $73798 to $129499, yet unrealized gains dropped from $14234 to $0, and unrealized losses surged from $235 to $3433, indicating a potential decline in market conditions or valuation adjustments.

2. **U.S. Government Obligations**: There was an improvement in the ratio of unrealized losses to amortized cost, which decreased from 6.6% ($6436/$97223) to 2.0% ($1981/$99700), suggesting a stabilization or recovery in the valuation of these securities.

3. **Overall Fair Value**: Despite an increase in total amortized cost from $171021 to $229199, the total fair value decreased from $179000 to $223785, highlighting a potential discrepancy between market valuation and book value.

4. **Market Conditions**: The absence of investments in a loss position for over 12 months in 2019, compared to six investments with long-term losses in 2018, suggests improved market conditions or strategic investment adjustments.
