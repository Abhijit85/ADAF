=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's quarterly financial results for 2019 show a mixed performance with some anomalies and trends in net sales, gross margin, and operating earnings. 

1. The company reported net sales of $115651 in the third quarter of 2019, which slightly decreased by $611 to $115040 in the fourth quarter. This indicates a minor downward trend in sales revenue towards the end of the year.
2. The gross margin for the first quarter of 2019 was $40615, which is the difference between net sales and the cost of goods sold. This figure provides an insight into the company's profitability after accounting for direct costs associated with production.
3. Operating earnings, which represent profits from the firm's core business operations, stood at $12391 in the fourth quarter of 2019. However, there was a significant increase of 20.14% in operating earnings between the first and second quarter of the year.
4. The company's basic earnings per share exceeded $0.30 in five quarters, indicating a relatively stable earnings performance per share during these periods.
   
It's important to note that all these figures are unaudited and are taken from the company's consolidated financial statements.
