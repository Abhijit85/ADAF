=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals significant trends and anomalies in interest rates, volatility, and stock option metrics over the period from 2017 to 2019.

1. The risk-free interest rate has shown a consistent increase, rising from 1.9% in 2017 to 2.8% in 2019, marking an approximate 47.4% increase over the period.
2. Expected volatility has surged significantly, with a 60.7% increase from 32.3% in 2017 to 51.9% in 2019, indicating heightened market uncertainty.
3. The expected term of stock options experienced a sharp decline from 7.0 years in 2017 to 3.4 years in 2018, before slightly increasing to 3.9 years in 2019, suggesting changes in market expectations or company policy.
4. An outlier in the data is the target price in 2018, which was notably higher at $98.99 compared to $67.39 in 2017 and $53.87 in 2019, potentially reflecting unique market conditions or company performance during that year.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Risk-free interest rate shows a consistent increase over the years: 1.9% (2017) → 2.3% (2018) → 2.8% (2019).
- [TREND] Expected volatility has increased significantly over the period: 32.3% (2017) → 45.8% (2018) → 51.9% (2019).
- [ANOMALY] Expected term shows a sharp decrease from 7.0 years (2017) to 3.4 years (2018), then a slight increase to 3.9 years (2019).
- [OUTLIER] Target price in 2018 is notably higher at $98.99 compared to $53.87 (2019) and $67.39 (2017).
- [RATIO] The increase in expected volatility from 2017 to 2019 is approximately 60.7% (32.3% → 51.9%).
- [RATIO] The risk-free interest rate increased by approximately 47.4% from 2017 to 2019 (1.9% → 2.8%).
- [DEFINITION] "NQs" are stock options subject to market-based vesting criteria.
- [SCOPE] Vesting occurs if stock price exceeds target within seven years of grant.
- [SOURCE] Fair values calculated using a "Monte Carlo simulation model."
- [NOTE] Share-based compensation recognized over an "estimated service period of approximately three years."
- [WARNING] Expense reversed if "required service period is not met."
- [SCOPE] Incremental cost from modification was $8.2 million, recognized over three years.
- [NOTE] Remaining compensation expense from modification as of September 27, 2019, is $2.8 million.
