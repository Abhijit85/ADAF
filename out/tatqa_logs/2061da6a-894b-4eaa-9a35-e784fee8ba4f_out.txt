=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's internal records show a significant increase in nonvested shares and a complex vesting process for Performance Share Units (PSUs) from 2016 to 2019. 
1. The number of nonvested shares rose by 174000 from 5974000 to 6148000 between December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2019, indicating a growth in the company's stock-based compensation scheme.
2. The number of vested shares as of December 31, 2019, was calculated to be 174000, derived from the difference between the number of shares granted and the sum of the number of shares released and cancelled.
3. From February 2016 to December 2019, the company granted PSUs on four occasions, with the largest grant of 547000 PSUs in February 2016. However, as of December 31, 2019, none of the PSUs granted in October 2018, April 2019, and December 2019 had vested.
4. The vesting of PSUs is contingent on the achievement of specific performance targets and continued service vesting requirements, adding a layer of complexity to the company's stock-based compensation strategy.
5. The restatement of the 2016 financial statements did not affect the stock-based compensation expense as the PSUs did not contain claw back rights, demonstrating the stability of the company's compensation structure.

- [ANOMALY] The number of shares that have been vested as of December 31, 2019 is not directly provided, but can be inferred from the number of shares granted and the number of shares released and cancelled. The number of shares vested is the difference between the number of shares granted and the sum of the number of shares released and cancelled, which is 3,288,000 - (1,774,000 + 1,340,000) = 174,000

                       'to 2019. \n'
                       '1. The number of nonvested shares rose by 174,000 from '
                       '5,974,000 to 6,148,000 between December 31, 2018, and '
                       'December 31, 2019, indicating a growth in the '
                       "company's stock-based compensation scheme.\n"
                       '2. The number of vested shares as of December 31, '
                       '2019, was calculated to be 174,000, derived from the '
                       'difference between the number of shares granted and '
                       'the sum of the number of shares released and '
                       'cancelled.\n'
                       '3. From February 2016 to December 2019, the company '
                       'granted PSUs on four occasions, with the largest grant '
                       'of 547,000 PSUs in February 2016. However, as of '
                       'December 31, 2019, none of the PSUs granted in October '
                       '2018, April 2019, and December 2019 had vested.\n'
                       '4. The vesting of PSUs is contingent on the '
                       'achievement of specific performance targets and '
                       'continued service vesting requirements, adding a layer '
                       "of complexity to the company's stock-based "
                       'compensation strategy.\n'
                       '5. The restatement of the 2016 financial statements '
                       'did not affect the stock-based compensation expense as '
                       'the PSUs did not contain claw back rights, '
                       "demonstrating the stability of the company's "
