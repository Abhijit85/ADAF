=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Commodity contracts have been the primary driver of significant gains in cash flow hedges over the fiscal years ending June 30, 2017, 2018, and 2019.

1. **Consistent Growth**: Commodity contracts showed a consistent increase in value from $9.4 million in 2017 to $41.4 million in 2018, and further to $45.4 million in 2019, indicating a strong upward trend in this segment.

2. **Majority Contribution**: These contracts consistently represented the majority of total gains, with figures such as $45.4 million out of $44.5 million in 2019, highlighting their dominant role in the overall financial performance.

3. **Significant Gains**: Total gains recognized saw a substantial increase from $9.3 million in 2017 to $44.5 million in 2019, marking a notable rise of $35.2 million over the period.

4. **Foreign Exchange Losses**: In contrast, foreign exchange contracts consistently showed losses, with figures of $(0.1) million in 2017, $(0.4) million in 2018, and $(0.9) million in 2019, indicating a persistent challenge in this area.
