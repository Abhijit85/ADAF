=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial performance from 2017 to 2019 shows fluctuations in cost of sales and gross profit, impacting the gross margin.

1. The cost of sales saw a significant decrease of 14.3% from 2017 to 2018 ($5075M to $5803M), followed by a modest increase of 1.0% from 2018 to 2019 ($5803M to $5860M).

2. Gross profit experienced an 18.0% increase from 2017 to 2018 ($3272M to $3861M), but then declined by 4.3% from 2018 to 2019 ($3861M to $3696M).

3. The gross margin improved by 80 basis points in 2018, reaching 40.0%, but decreased by 130 basis points in 2019 to 38.7%, partly due to $65 million in unused capacity charges affecting the margin by 70 basis points.

4. Factors influencing these changes include "price pressure," "manufacturing efficiencies," "product mix," and "currency effects," highlighting the complex dynamics affecting financial outcomes.
