=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The gross margin of a company fluctuated between 2018 and 2019 due to changes in cost of sales and gross profit. 
1. In 2018, the company experienced an improvement in gross margin to 40.0%, driven by a decrease in the cost of sales by 14.3% and an increase in gross profit by 18.0%. This was attributed to manufacturing efficiencies and a better product mix.
2. However, in 2019, the gross margin decreased to 38.7%. This was due to an increase in the cost of sales by 1.0% and a decrease in gross profit by 4.3%. The company cited normal price pressure and increased unsaturation charges as reasons for this decrease.
3. The company also incurred "unused capacity charges" of $65 million in 2019, which impacted the gross margin by 70 basis points.
4. It should be noted that the average cost of sales, gross profit, and gross margin as a percentage of net revenues cannot be calculated from the provided data, as the table does not provide total or average values.
