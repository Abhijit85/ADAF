=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's tax situation has seen significant changes from 2017 to 2019, with increases in statutory federal income tax, decreases in domestic manufacturers deductions, and the impact of the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017". 
1. The statutory federal income tax saw a substantial increase of $19799 from 2018 to 2019, moving from $14694 to $34105. 
2. The federal state income tax for the fiscal year 2019 was recorded at $2164, while the company paid federal and state income taxes of $36.5 million in the same year. 
3. The average tax-exempt interest income was calculated at $(168), derived from the average of $197, $101, and $206. 
4. There was a significant decrease of 162.5% in the domestic manufacturers deduction from 2017 to 2018, dropping from $4095 to $2545. 
5. The "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017" reduced the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which likely had a significant impact on the company's tax situation. 
6. The company recorded a $43 million tax benefit in fiscal 2018 and had no adjustments to its provision for income taxes due to uncertain tax positions as of June 1, 2019. However, it is currently under audit by the IRS for the fiscal years 2013 through 2015 and by state and local tax authorities in certain jurisdictions.
