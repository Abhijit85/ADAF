=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The data provides insights into the financial operations of a company, including costs of revenue, research and development expenses, and share-based compensation expenses. 
1. The cost of revenue for the company has seen fluctuations over the years, with $3189 in 2017, $3869 in 2018, and $2936 in 2019, resulting in an average cost of revenue of $3331.33 for the period 2017-2019.
2. The company's research and development expenses in 2019 were less than $10000 thousands, indicating a significant investment in this area, although exact figures are not provided.
3. There was a decrease in the Selling, general and administrative expense from 2018 to 2019 by $2315 ($14620 - $12305), suggesting cost-saving measures or operational efficiencies.
4. The share-based compensation expense for 2017 was $0.8 million, but the table does not provide this information for other years. Additionally, the total unrecognized compensation costs related to outstanding stock options, restricted stock awards, and units as of September 27, 2019, was $47.0 million, expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.9 years.
