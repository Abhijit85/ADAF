=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial performance for the year ended December 31, 2018, shows a notable decline in revenue and profitability, with significant impacts from discontinued operations.

1. Total revenue decreased by $2148, from $11993 to $9845, driven primarily by a $1508 drop in software delivery, support, and maintenance revenue, which fell from $10949 to $9441.
2. Client services revenue saw a substantial decline of $640, from $1044 to $404, while the cost of client services increased by $569, from $261 to $830, indicating a potential inefficiency or increased cost structure in this segment.
3. Gross profit decreased by $2121, from $8814 to $6693, reflecting the overall revenue decline and increased costs, particularly in client services.
4. Income from discontinued operations before taxes decreased by $2624, from $7666 to $5042, with net income from these operations also falling by $945, from $4676 to $3731, despite a significant decrease in the income tax provision by $1679, from $2990 to $1311.
