=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of financial trends reveals shifts in key rates affecting defined benefit pension plans over recent years.

1. The discount rate showed a general downward trend from 3.2% in 2017 to 2.4% in 2018, before slightly increasing to 2.5% in 2019, indicating a temporary deviation from the previous pattern.
2. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets decreased significantly from 4.3% in 2017 to 3.3% in 2018 and remained stable at 3.3% in 2019, suggesting a more conservative outlook on investment returns.
3. The rate of compensation increase remained relatively stable, with a slight rise from 2.2% in 2017 to 2.3% in both 2018 and 2019, reflecting consistent wage growth expectations.
4. These assumptions, based on "interest rates guaranteed under the insurance contracts" and influenced by asset class allocations, are crucial for calculating defined benefit pension plans, highlighting the importance of accurate rate predictions.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Discount rate decreased over the years: 3.2% (2017) → 2.4% (2018) → 2.5% (2019).
- [TREND] Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets decreased from 4.3% (2017) to 3.3% (2018) and remained stable at 3.3% in 2019.
- [ANOMALY] The discount rate increased slightly from 2.4% (2018) to 2.5% (2019), breaking the previous downward trend.
- [OUTLIER] The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets in 2017 was significantly higher at 4.3% compared to subsequent years at 3.3%.
- [TREND] Rate of compensation increase remained relatively stable: 2.2% (2017) → 2.3% (2018) → 2.3% (2019).
- [DEFINITION] "Weighted-average expected long-term rate of return" is 3.3%.
- [SOURCE] Rate is based on "interest rates guaranteed under the insurance contracts".
- [SCOPE] Assumptions are "customary rates and practices for the location of the plans".
- [NOTE] Asset class allocations and periodic studies influence the rate of return.
- [WARNING] Assumptions affect "defined benefit pension plans" calculations.
