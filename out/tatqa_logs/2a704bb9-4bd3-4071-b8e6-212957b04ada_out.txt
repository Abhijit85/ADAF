=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals significant changes in the company's hedging activities and interest rate swap contracts as of 31 December 2019 and 2018.

1. An anomaly was observed as the carrying amount shifted from an asset of 1663 RMB’Million to a liability of (494) RMB’Million, indicating a substantial reclassification in the financial statements.
   
2. The notional amount of interest rate swaps decreased significantly by 48207 RMB’Million, from 77630 to 29423 RMB’Million, suggesting a strategic reduction in hedging activities.

3. There was a sharp drop in the change in fair value of hedging instruments by 2320 RMB’Million, from 181 to -2139 RMB’Million, which was mirrored by an identical drop in the value of the hedged item, indicating a direct correlation between the two.

4. Despite these changes, the weighted average hedged rate increased by 0.50%, from 1.60% to 2.10%, while the hedge ratio remained constant at 1:1, reflecting consistent hedging effectiveness.
