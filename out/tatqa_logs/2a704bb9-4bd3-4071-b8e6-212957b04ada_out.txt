=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The carrying and notional amounts of interest rate swaps experienced significant changes from 2018 to 2019, with the carrying amount decreasing and the notional amount also decreasing. 
1. The carrying amount of interest rate swaps decreased by 2157 RMB’Million from 1663 RMB’Million in 2018 to (494) RMB’Million in 2019. This represents a significant decrease in the value of these contracts.
2. The notional amount of the interest rate swaps also decreased significantly, by 48207 RMB’Million from 77630 RMB’Million in 2018 to 29423 RMB’Million in 2019. This suggests a reduction in the total amount of interest rate risk being hedged by these contracts.
3. The weighted average hedged rate increased by 0.50% from 1.60% in 2018 to 2.10% in 2019. This indicates a higher average fixed rate being paid on the hedged borrowings.
4. Despite these changes, the contracts continue to cover the majority of the floating-rate borrowing and notes payable principal outstanding, converting these borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates.
