Answer Echoes:
- **What are the financial items listed in the table?**
- Salaries and fees
- Incentive schemes
- Other benefits
- **What does the table show?**
- The table shows the financial data for salaries and fees, incentive schemes, and other benefits for the years 2017, 2018, and 2019, measured in millions of euros (€m).
- **How much is the 2019 salaries and fees?**
- €4 million
- **What is the average salaries and fees between 2018 and 2019?**
- Calculation: (2018 value + 2019 value) / 2 = (4 + 4) / 2 = €4 million
- **What is the average incentive schemes between 2018 and 2019?**
- Calculation: (2018 value + 2019 value) / 2 = (3 + 2) / 2 = €2.5 million
- **What is the difference between average salaries and fees and average incentive schemes from 2018 to 2019?**
- Calculation: Average salaries and fees - Average incentive schemes = €4 million - €2.5 million = €1.5 million
