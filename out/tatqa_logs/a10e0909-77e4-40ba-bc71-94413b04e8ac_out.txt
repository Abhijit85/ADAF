=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of lease liabilities from 2020 to 2024 reveals significant trends and disparities between operating and finance leases. 

1. Operating leases have shown a consistent decline from $460 million in 2020 to $194 million in 2024, while finance leases decreased from $47 million to $21 million over the same period, stabilizing at $22 million in 2022 and 2023.
   
2. The total lease payments for operating leases amount to $2274 million, significantly higher than the $310 million for finance leases, resulting in a ratio of approximately 7.34:1, highlighting a substantial reliance on operating leases.

3. A notable anomaly is the 'Thereafter' category for operating leases, which stands at $686 million, indicating a large portion of payments are deferred beyond the immediate years.

4. The interest deducted from operating leases is $516 million, much larger than the $90 million from finance leases, suggesting a higher cost of borrowing associated with operating leases.

- [ANOMALY] The 'Thereafter' category for operating leases ($686 million) is notably higher than any single year, suggesting a large portion of payments are deferred.
- [OUTLIER] The interest deducted from operating leases ($516 million) is much larger than that from finance leases ($90 million), indicating a higher cost of borrowing.
