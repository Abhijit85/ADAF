=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial report indicates significant changes in financial assets and liabilities from 2018 to 2019. 
1. The opening balance of financial assets increased from RMB’Million 77131 in 2018 under IAS 39 to RMB’Million 100107 in 2018 under IFRS9, indicating a shift in accounting standards.
2. The additions of financial assets decreased by Δ-12069 from 51185 in 2018 to 39116 in 2019, suggesting a slowdown in asset acquisition.
3. The closing balance of financial assets in 2019 was 147% of the 2018 closing balance (123093/83934*100), showing a substantial growth in assets.
4. The currency translation differences of financial assets decreased by Δ-3206 from 4946 in 2018 to 1740 in 2019, indicating a reduction in foreign exchange gains or losses.
5. The report also mentions a transfer between level 1 and 2 for recurring fair value measurements in 2019, which could impact the valuation of financial instruments. However, the context does not provide specific figures for this transfer.
