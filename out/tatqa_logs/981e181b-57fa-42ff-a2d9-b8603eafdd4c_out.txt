=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial performance from 2017 to 2019 shows significant fluctuations in net income and share metrics, highlighting both growth and challenges in profitability.

1. **Net Income Trends**: There was a substantial increase in net income from 2017 to 2018 ($47157 to $254127), followed by a decrease in 2019 to $206587, indicating volatility and an unusual spike in 2018.

2. **Profitability Per Share**: Both net income per basic share and per diluted share decreased from 2018 to 2019, from $4.81 to $3.57 and $4.33 to $3.50, respectively, reflecting a decline in profitability per share.

3. **Share Dynamics**: Basic shares outstanding consistently increased over the years (46552 to 52798 to 57840), while diluted shares also rose slightly (55389 to 58640 to 59082), suggesting a growing number of shares impacting earnings calculations.

4. **Anomalies in Conversion**: The assumed conversion of warrants dropped to zero in 2019 from 3551 in 2018, and employee stock grants decreased from 2291 to 1242, indicating changes in stock-based compensation strategies.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Net income increased significantly from 2017 to 2018 ($47,157→$254,127) but decreased in 2019 ($254,127→$206,587).
- [RATIO] Net income per basic share decreased from 2018 to 2019 ($4.81→$3.57), indicating a decline in profitability per share.
- [RATIO] Net income per diluted share also decreased from 2018 to 2019 ($4.33→$3.50), consistent with the basic share trend.
- [ANOMALY] Assumed conversion of warrants dropped to zero in 2019 from 3,551 in 2018 and 6,602 in 2017.
- [TREND] Basic shares outstanding increased each year (46,552→52,798→57,840), showing a consistent upward trend.
- [OUTLIER] The net income in 2018 ($254,127) is an outlier compared to 2017 ($47,157) and 2019 ($206,587), suggesting an unusual spike.
- [TREND] Diluted shares outstanding increased slightly from 2017 to 2019 (55,389→58,640→59,082), indicating more shares are being considered in earnings calculations.
- [ANOMALY] Assumed conversion of employee stock grants decreased from 2018 to 2019 (2,291→1,242), which is a notable reduction.
- [SCOPE] Covers fiscal years ending March 31, 2018, and 2017.
- [DEFINITION] "Basic and diluted weighted-average number of shares of common stock" are key figures.
- [SOURCE] Adjustments due to "adoption of ASC 606."
- [NOTE] Data presented in "amounts in thousands, except per share data."
- [WARNING] Fiscal years 2018 and 2017 figures are adjusted.
