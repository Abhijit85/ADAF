=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's unrecognized tax benefits from 2017 to 2019 averaged $7397 thousand, with the ending balance exceeding $8200 thousand in 2018 and 2019, and totaling $24584 thousand over the three-year period. 
1. The average unrecognized tax benefit - beginning balance for the three-year period from 2017 to 2019 was $7397 thousand, calculated by adding the balances for each year and dividing by three.
2. The years 2018 and 2019 had an unrecognized tax benefit - ending balance of greater than $8200 thousand, specifically $8217 thousand and $8840 thousand respectively.
3. The total unrecognized tax benefit - ending balance across all three years was $24584 thousand, which is the sum of the ending balances for each year.
4. Despite these unrecognized tax benefits, the company's effective tax rate would not be impacted if they were recognized, due to offsetting changes in the company's valuation allowance. Furthermore, the company does not anticipate any significant changes in its unrecognized tax benefits over the next year. However, the company's net operating loss and research credit carryforwards may be subject to adjustment, and the utilization of these carryforwards and credits could be substantially limited due to ownership change limitations.
