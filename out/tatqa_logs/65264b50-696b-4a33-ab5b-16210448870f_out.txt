=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's financial data for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 shows a significant increase in the cost of license and subscription revenue, with a notable lack of information on hosting related costs for 2018. 

1. The cost of license and subscription revenue rose by $29346 thousands from 2018 ($35452 thousands) to 2019 ($64798 thousands), indicating a substantial increase in expenses incurred in generating this revenue.
2. Despite the increase in license and subscription costs, maintenance costs remained relatively low, under $15000 thousands in both 2018 ($14783 thousands) and 2019 ($16499 thousands).
3. The average services cost for the two years was calculated to be $244800.5 thousands, while the average total cost of revenue was $310566.5 thousands. These averages provide a broader perspective on the company's financial performance over the two-year period.
4. The company saw a slight decrease in professional services employees from 838 in 2018 to 781 in 2019, while technical support and licensing operations employees increased from 121 in 2018 to 198 in 2019. This shift in personnel may have implications for the company's operational focus and cost structure. 
5. The lack of specific figures for hosting related costs in 2018 and average services for 2018 and 2019 limits a comprehensive understanding of the company's financial performance.
