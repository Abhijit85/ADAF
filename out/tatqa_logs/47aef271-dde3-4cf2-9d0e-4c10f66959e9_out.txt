=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In the recent financial analysis, there is a notable shift in the cost dynamics between products and services.

1. The cost of products has decreased by 12%, from $34066 to $29816, indicating a significant reduction in expenses related to third-party manufacturing and inventory costs.
2. Conversely, the cost of services has increased by 7%, rising from $17830 to $19065, driven by higher personnel costs and inventory for hardware replacements.
3. The products to services cost ratio has shifted from 34066:17830 in 2018 to 29816:19065 in 2019, reflecting a relative increase in the proportion of service costs.
4. The reduction in product costs by $4250 is a significant outlier compared to the $1235 increase in service costs, suggesting a more substantial impact on the overall cost structure from product-related savings.
