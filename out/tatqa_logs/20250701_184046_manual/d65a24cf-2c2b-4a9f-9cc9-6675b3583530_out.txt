=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals a mixed performance in cash flow activities, with notable shifts in operating, investing, and financing activities. 

1. Net cash inflow from operating activities decreased by 9.9% to S$5.37 billion, indicating a potential challenge in generating cash from core business operations.
2. Despite a 19.4% increase in net cash outflow for investing activities to S$2.33 billion, which included property disposals and acquisitions, the group managed a slight increase in free cash flow by 1.2% to S$3.65 billion.
3. Financing activities saw a significant reduction in net cash outflow by 23.8% to S$3.06 billion, primarily due to major cash outflows for dividends, totaling S$2.86 billion.
4. The cash balance at the end of the year decreased by 2.3% to S$513 million, while the net change in cash balance showed a notable percentage increase of 248.9%, albeit from a small base, highlighting volatility in cash reserves.
