=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Over the past three fiscal years, the company has experienced significant changes in its stock-based compensation metrics, reflecting strategic shifts in share management and exercise activity.

1. **Shares Outstanding and Exercise Price Trends**: The number of shares outstanding decreased from 3015374 to 1686902, while the weighted-average exercise price per share increased from $3.95 to $7.00, indicating a strategic reduction in share availability and a rise in the cost to exercise options.

2. **2018 Exercise Anomaly**: In 2018, a substantial number of shares were exercised (1384647), far exceeding the previous years' figures of 235514 in 2016 and 250823 in 2017, suggesting a unique event or incentive that year.

3. **Contractual Term and Cancellations**: The weighted-average remaining contractual term decreased from 6.4 years in 2016 to 4.6 years in 2018, then increased to 5.4 years in 2019, alongside a notable increase in share cancellations in 2018 (144183), compared to 81794 in 2016 and 88076 in 2017.

4. **Intrinsic Value and Compensation Expenses**: The intrinsic value of options exercised was $11.1M in 2019, a significant increase from $1.4M in both 2018 and 2017, while stock-based compensation expenses varied, with $0.7M in 2019, $1.4M in 2018, and $1.0M in 2017, reflecting fluctuating financial impacts of these activities.
