=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of share activity from December 31, 2018, to December 31, 2019, reveals key trends and anomalies in nonvested shares and stock unit grants.

1. Nonvested shares saw a modest increase of 174 (from 5974 to 6148), despite 3288 shares being granted, highlighting significant releases and cancellations.
2. The average share price experienced a slight rise of $0.08 (from $6.51 to $6.59), with granted shares having the highest average price at $6.74.
3. The ratio of granted to released shares was 3288 to 1774, while the ratio of canceled to released shares was 1340 to 1774, indicating a substantial number of shares were either released or canceled.
4. None of the PSUs granted in 2018 and 2019 had vested by the end of 2019, and the lack of claw back rights in PSUs could impact compensation expense reporting.
