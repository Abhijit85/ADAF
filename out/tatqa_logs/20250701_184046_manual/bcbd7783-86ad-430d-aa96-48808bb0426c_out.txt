=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

BCE's financial performance in Q4 2019 showed moderate growth across its segments, with notable increases in revenue and net earnings. 

1. Bell Wireless led the revenue growth with an increase of $86 million, or 3.6%, driven by higher service and product revenues, contributing significantly to the overall performance.
2. Bell Media also saw a revenue rise of $29 million, or 3.4%, while Bell Wireline remained stable with a negligible $1 million increase, indicating consistent performance in this segment.
3. Despite the overall revenue growth of 1.6% to $6316 million, inter-segment eliminations increased by $15 million, an 8.4% change, highlighting a significant internal adjustment.
4. Net earnings surged by 12.6%, supported by a 4.8% increase in adjusted EBITDA and lower expenses, although free cash flow decreased to $894 million due to higher capital expenditures.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Bell Wireless revenue increased by $86 million (2,407→2,493), a 3.6% rise.
- [TREND] Bell Media revenue increased by $29 million (850→879), a 3.4% rise.
- [RATIO] Bell Wireline showed a negligible change with only a $1 million increase (3,137→3,138), indicating stability.
- [ANOMALY] Inter-segment eliminations increased by $15 million, from $(179) million to $(194) million, an 8.4% change, which is significant compared to other segments.
- [TREND] Total BCE operating revenues increased by $101 million (6,215→6,316), a 1.6% rise.
- [DEFINITION] "Adjusted EBITDA" increased by 4.8% in Q4 2019, reflecting growth across all segments.
- [SCOPE] BCE's "operating revenues grew by 1.6%" in Q4 2019 compared to Q4 2018.
- [NOTE] "IFRS 16" adoption had a "favourable impact" on adjusted EBITDA and operating costs.
- [SOURCE] "Bell Wireless operating revenues increased by 3.6%" due to higher service and product revenues.
- [WARNING] "Free cash flow" decreased to $894 million from $1,022 million due to higher capital expenditures.
- [SCOPE] "Net earnings increased by 12.6%" mainly due to higher adjusted EBITDA and lower expenses.
- [NOTE] "Cash flows from operating activities" rose to $2,091 million, partly due to no DB pension plan contribution in 2019.
