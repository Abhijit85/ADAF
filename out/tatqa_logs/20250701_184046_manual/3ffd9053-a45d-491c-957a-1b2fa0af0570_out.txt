=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Fixed Price sales have shown a consistent upward trend, becoming increasingly dominant in the overall sales structure.

1. Fixed Price sales increased from $1036.9 in 2017 to $1452.4 in 2019, marking a significant jump, particularly with a $306.2 increase from 2018 to 2019.
2. Total sales mirrored this growth, rising from $1107.7 in 2017 to $1496.5 in 2019, indicating a robust overall sales performance.
3. Other sales, however, decreased from 70.8 in 2017 to 44.1 in 2019, highlighting a shift away from non-fixed price contracts.
4. The proportion of Fixed Price sales relative to Total sales increased from 93.6% in 2017 to 97.0% in 2019, underscoring their growing dominance in the sales portfolio.
