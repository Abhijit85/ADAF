=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In analyzing GreenSky, Inc.'s tax expenses, significant shifts in state and deferred tax expenses have notably impacted the overall tax benefit in 2019. 

1. Federal current income tax expense saw a modest increase from $4 to $5, indicating a slight rise in federal tax obligations.
2. State current income tax expense doubled from $5 to $10, reflecting a substantial increase in state tax liabilities.
3. A major anomaly occurred with the state deferred income tax, which shifted from an expense of $665 to a benefit of $(11346), resulting in a dramatic change of $(12011).
4. The total income tax expense transitioned from an expense of $5534 in 2018 to a benefit of $(7125) in 2019, marking a significant difference of $(12659), largely influenced by the deferred tax changes.
