=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In fiscal year 2019, the company experienced significant changes in its financial income and expenses, impacting its overall financial performance.

1. **Interest Income Surge**: Interest income saw a substantial increase of $16901, or 127%, rising from $13281 to $30182. This growth was primarily driven by a $600 million influx from a stock and note offering in March 2018.

2. **Rising Interest Expenses**: Interest expenses also rose significantly by $10892, or 169%, from $(6442) to $(17334). This increase included $12.2 million in noncash expenses and $5.0 million in stated interest, reflecting higher costs associated with debt.

3. **Other Income Decline**: There was an anomaly in other income (expense), which shifted from a positive $509 to a negative $(1867), marking a decrease of $2376 or 467%. This was influenced by a net currency exchange loss of $1.9 million.

These financial shifts highlight the impact of strategic financing decisions and currency fluctuations on the company's fiscal health.
