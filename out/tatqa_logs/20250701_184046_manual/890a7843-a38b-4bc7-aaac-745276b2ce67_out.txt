=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of the options and shares data reveals significant changes in outstanding options, grants, and exercises over the year.

1. The number of outstanding options increased by 421825 from 2682738 to 3104563 as of 1 April, indicating a substantial rise in the total options available.
2. There was a notable decrease in options granted during the year, dropping by 735454 from 1188149 to 452695, suggesting a reduction in new option allocations.
3. Options forfeited in 2019 were significantly lower than in 2018, decreasing by 661111 from 766324 to 105213, which may reflect improved retention or performance.
4. An outlier was observed with 483316 options exercised in 2019, a figure absent in 2018, highlighting a potential increase in option execution activity.
