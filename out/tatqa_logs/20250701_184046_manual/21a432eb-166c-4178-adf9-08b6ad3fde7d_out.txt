=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals significant changes in the company's financial assets and liabilities, influenced by various adjustments and market conditions.

1. Financial assets saw a substantial increase of RMB 39159 million, rising from RMB 83934 million to RMB 123093 million, partly due to a significant adjustment of RMB 22976 million upon adopting IFRS 9.
   
2. Financial liabilities decreased by RMB 2593 million, from RMB 4466 million to RMB 1873 million, with a notable negative adjustment of RMB 977 million resulting from a business combination in 2019.

3. There was a large transfer out of financial assets amounting to RMB 93151 million in 2018, indicating a significant reallocation or disposal of assets during that period.

4. The changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss for financial assets decreased sharply from RMB 30485 million to RMB 9241 million, reflecting a potential decline in market performance or valuation adjustments.
