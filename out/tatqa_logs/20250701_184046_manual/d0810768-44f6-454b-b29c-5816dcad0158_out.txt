=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In 2019, significant changes in asset categories were observed, notably with the introduction and increase of certain non-current assets. 

1. **Right of Use Assets**: These assets appeared for the first time in 2019, valued at $33014, indicating a new accounting recognition or lease agreements impacting the balance sheet.
   
2. **Deferred Contract Acquisition Costs**: There was a modest increase of $113, from $3184 to $3297, suggesting a slight rise in costs associated with acquiring contracts, which could reflect increased sales activities or new customer acquisitions.

3. **Deposits**: An increase of $363, from $1975 to $2338, was noted, potentially indicating higher customer deposits or prepayments, which could enhance liquidity or signal increased customer engagement.

4. **Total Other Non-Current Assets**: This category saw a substantial rise of $33226, from $8620 to $41846, highlighting a significant reclassification or acquisition of long-term assets, which may impact future financial stability and investment potential.
