=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals significant changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities, impacting the company's tax position.

1. Net operating losses and credits increased by $51981, from $61494 to $113475, indicating a growing potential for future tax relief.
2. The introduction of deferred tax liabilities for accruals and reserves at ($15525) in 2019, which were absent in 2018, marks a notable shift in tax strategy.
3. A substantial increase in the valuation allowance by $63459, from $181122 to $244581, significantly affects the net deferred tax assets, which decreased by $466, from $4317 to $3851.
4. Despite the total deferred tax assets rising by $78872, from $185999 to $264871, the net deferred tax assets, after accounting for the valuation allowance, increased by a factor of 4.16, from $4877 to $20290, highlighting the impact of the valuation allowance adjustments.
