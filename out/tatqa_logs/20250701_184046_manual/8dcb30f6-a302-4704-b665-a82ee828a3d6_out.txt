=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of restructuring activities reveals a notable reduction in employee separation expenses and fluctuations in lease-related costs over the years. 

1. Employee separation expenses experienced a dramatic decline from $8353 in 2017 to $2094 in 2018, and further to $1150 in 2019, indicating a strategic reduction in workforce-related costs.
2. The sharp decrease in employee separation expenses from 2017 to 2018, amounting to $6259, highlights a significant restructuring effort, possibly influenced by a $5.1 million stock-based compensation in 2017.
3. Lease-related expenses increased from $1025 in 2017 to $1608 in 2018, before decreasing to $1301 in 2019, reflecting adjustments in facility usage, likely due to exiting redundant facilities.
4. Total expenses saw a substantial reduction of approximately 60% from $9524 in 2017 to $3838 in 2018, underscoring the impact of restructuring activities on overall cost efficiency.
