1. Nonvested shares saw a substantial increase from 98 on January 1, 2017, to 377 by December 29, 2019, indicating a growing commitment to stock-based compensation.
2. The weighted average grant date fair value of shares decreased notably from $23.52 in 2017 to $12.55 in 2019, with a sharp drop to $10.77 in 2019, suggesting a decline in perceived share value or market conditions.
3. A significant surge in shares granted occurred in 2019, with 353 shares compared to 110 in 2018, marking the highest number of shares granted in the observed period.
4. Vested shares increased from 43 in 2017 to 118 in 2019, while forfeited shares also rose from 19 to 41, reflecting both higher engagement and turnover in stock-based compensation plans.
