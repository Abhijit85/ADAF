=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals a complex interplay of income growth, cash flow stability, and significant financing activities over the fiscal years 2018 and 2019.

1. **Net Income Growth**: The company experienced a steady increase in net income, rising from $14366 in 2017 to $24193 in 2019, indicating robust profitability improvements over the period.

2. **Stable Operating Cash Flow**: Despite fluctuations in net income and non-cash charges, cash provided by operating activities remained relatively stable, with figures of $31497 in 2017, $45082 in 2018, and $45007 in 2019, suggesting effective operational cash management.

3. **Negative Working Capital Changes**: The changes in working capital became increasingly negative, from $(11594) in 2017 to $(26811) in 2019, which could signal potential liquidity challenges or strategic inventory and receivables management.

4. **Unusual Financing Activity**: The cash provided by financing activities in 2019 was notably high at $96947, compared to $(10442) in 2018 and $19429 in 2017, primarily due to proceeds from Senior Notes and ABL settlements, reflecting a strategic shift in capital structure.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Net income increased consistently: $14,366 (2017) → $20,402 (2018) → $24,193 (2019)
- [TREND] Non-cash charges increased each year: $28,725 (2017) → $38,186 (2018) → $47,625 (2019)
- [ANOMALY] Changes in working capital became more negative: $(11,594) (2017) → $(13,506) (2018) → $(26,811) (2019)
- [OUTLIER] Cash provided by (used in) financing activities in 2019 was unusually high at $96,947 compared to $(10,442) (2018) and $19,429 (2017)
- [RATIO] Cash provided by operating activities remained stable despite changes in net income: $31,497 (2017) → $45,082 (2018) → $45,007 (2019)
- [TREND] Cash used in investing activities fluctuated: $(42,406) (2017) → $(33,688) (2018) → $(44,154) (2019)
- [DEFINITION] "Net cash provided by operations" includes net income and non-cash charges, offset by working capital changes.
- [SCOPE] Fiscal years covered are 2018 and 2019, detailing cash flow activities.
- [SOURCE] "Net cash used in investing activities" includes capital expenditures and acquisitions.
- [NOTE] Fiscal 2019 saw significant cash use for acquisitions, notably Bassian.
