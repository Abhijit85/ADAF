=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of stock-based compensation plans reveals mixed trends in various components over recent years. 

1. Service-Based RSUs have shown a steady increase, rising from $1762 in 2017 to $2207 in 2019, indicating a growing reliance on these awards for employee compensation.
2. Performance-Based RSUs experienced a decline from $3089 in 2018 to $2553 in 2019, after a previous increase, suggesting potential challenges in meeting performance targets or a strategic shift in compensation structure.
3. Cash-settled awards have consistently increased, from $72 in 2017 to $255 in 2019, reflecting a possible preference for more liquid compensation options.
4. The ratio of Net to Total compensation improved from 62.4% in 2017 to 77.4% in 2019, highlighting a more efficient allocation of compensation resources.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Service-Based RSUs increased steadily over the years: $1,762 (2017) → $2,036 (2018) → $2,207 (2019).
- [ANOMALY] Performance-Based RSUs decreased from $3,089 (2018) to $2,553 (2019), despite an increase from $2,350 (2017) to $3,089 (2018).
- [TREND] Cash-settled awards show a consistent increase: $72 (2017) → $131 (2018) → $255 (2019).
- [OUTLIER] The income tax benefit decreased significantly from $1,573 (2017) to $1,133 (2019), with a notable drop in 2018 to $1,188.
- [RATIO] The ratio of Net to Total increased from 62.4% (2017) to 77.4% (2019), calculated as $2,611/$4,184 (2017) and $3,882/$5,015 (2019).
