1. Adjusted operating profit rose by £17.8m, from £264.9m to £282.7m, indicating improved operational efficiency and profitability.
2. EBITDA, which includes depreciation and amortisation, increased by £19.2m, from £297.8m to £317.0m, reflecting the company's enhanced earnings capacity.
3. Net debt surged by £59.4m, from £235.8m to £295.2m, marking a significant 25.2% increase, which outpaced the EBITDA growth of 6.4%, potentially raising concerns about financial leverage.
4. The net debt to EBITDA ratio rose from 0.8 to 0.9, suggesting a higher debt burden relative to earnings, which could impact future financial flexibility and risk assessment.
