=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial data indicates a positive trend in cash flow metrics, with some notable fluctuations in specific areas. 

1. Cash generated by operations has shown a steady increase over the years, rising from €13781 million to €14182 million, reflecting strong operational performance.
2. Operating free cash flow also increased consistently, from €5627 million to €7071 million, suggesting improved efficiency in cash management.
3. An anomaly is observed in the working capital movement related to capital additions, which fluctuated significantly from (€822 million) to €171 million, then to (€89 million), indicating volatility in capital expenditure management.
4. Licence and spectrum payments peaked in 2018 at €1123 million, highlighting a significant outlier compared to €837 million in 2019 and €474 million in 2017, which may impact cash flow planning.
