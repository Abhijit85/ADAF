=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals significant changes in the company's receivables, highlighting both growth and potential risks.

1. Trade receivables increased by $716000, from $3054000 to $3770000, indicating a rise in amounts due from customers for rental income, goods sold, or services performed.
2. The allowance for expected credit losses saw a notable increase of $112000, from $(23000) to $(135000), raising the percentage of trade receivables from 0.75% to 3.58%, which suggests heightened concerns about credit risk.
3. Receivables from related parties surged by $3841000, from $8039000 to $11880000, marking a substantial rise compared to other categories and potentially indicating increased intra-group transactions.
4. Total current receivables grew by $4586000, from $15152000 to $19738000, while total current and non-current receivables increased by $4103000, from $15753000 to $19856000, reflecting overall growth in the company's receivables portfolio.
