=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals a significant decrease in total assets, primarily due to a reduction in indemnification receivable from SSL for pre-closing taxes.

1. Indemnification receivable from SSL for pre-closing taxes saw a substantial decline of $1812, dropping from $2410 to $598, which was a major factor in the overall decrease in total assets.
2. The proportion of indemnification receivable to total assets decreased from 74.6% in 2018 to 45.2% in 2019, indicating a shift in asset composition.
3. Despite the overall decrease in total assets by $1910, there were slight increases in other areas: 'Due from affiliates' rose by $25 (from $161 to $186), and 'Prepaid expenses' increased by $13 (from $151 to $164).
4. The 'Other' category of assets decreased by $136, from $510 to $374, contributing to the overall reduction in total assets.
