=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of property, plant, and equipment reveals a net increase despite mixed trends in asset categories. 

1. **Land and Construction Declines**: Land and improvements decreased by $19 million (from $171 million to $152 million), and construction in process fell by $87 million (from $724 million to $637 million), indicating a reduction in new development activities.

2. **Growth in Buildings and Equipment**: Buildings and improvements saw a $14 million increase (from $1379 million to $1393 million), while machinery and equipment rose significantly by $174 million (from $7124 million to $7298 million), driving overall asset growth.

3. **Minimal Depreciation Impact**: Despite the substantial increase in machinery and equipment, accumulated depreciation increased by only $5 million (from $5901 million to $5906 million), suggesting efficient asset management or extended asset life.

4. **Overall Asset Growth**: The total property, plant, and equipment, gross increased by $82 million (from $9398 million to $9480 million), with the net value rising by $77 million (from $3497 million to $3574 million), reflecting a positive investment trend.
