=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of derivative financial instruments from 2017 to 2019 reveals significant shifts in interest rate swaps and liabilities, alongside notable anomalies in foreign exchange contracts.

1. **Interest Rate Swaps Surge**: Interest rate swaps saw a dramatic increase from 9196 to 49891, indicating a strategic shift towards managing interest rate exposure by converting floating rates to fixed rates.

2. **Derivative Liabilities Growth**: Total derivative liabilities rose sharply from 12092 to 49932, with current liabilities increasing from 2091 to 8095 and non-current liabilities from 10001 to 41837, reflecting a substantial rise in long-term financial commitments.

3. **Foreign Exchange Contracts Decline**: Forward foreign exchange contracts experienced a steep decline from 1467 to 41, suggesting a reduced focus or need for currency risk management during this period.

4. **Cross Currency Swaps Discontinuation**: Cross currency swaps, which were 1429 in 2018, were not reported in 2019, indicating a possible strategic withdrawal from these instruments.
