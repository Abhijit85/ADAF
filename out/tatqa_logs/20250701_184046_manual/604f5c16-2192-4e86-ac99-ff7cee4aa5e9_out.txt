=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals significant shifts in deferred tax assets and liabilities, highlighting both growth and anomalies in specific areas.

1. Property, plant, and equipment deferred tax liabilities saw a substantial increase of $60154, rising from $88351 to $148505, contributing to the overall rise in total deferred tax liabilities by $60314, from $90102 to $150416, primarily due to "bonus depreciation" in fiscal 2019.

2. Net operating loss deferred tax assets experienced a dramatic increase of $47980, from $6481 to $54461, which significantly bolstered the total deferred tax assets, increasing by $48975, from $27309 to $76284.

3. Despite the general trend of increasing assets, inventory deferred tax assets decreased by $1707, from $2862 to $1155, and state income tax credits deferred tax assets fell by $2902, from $12235 to $9333, indicating specific areas of concern.

4. The valuation allowance decreased notably by $5380, from $(11017) to $(5637), reflecting a strategic adjustment in the company's tax planning, while the ratio of total deferred tax liabilities to assets stands at approximately 1.97, indicating liabilities are nearly double the assets.
