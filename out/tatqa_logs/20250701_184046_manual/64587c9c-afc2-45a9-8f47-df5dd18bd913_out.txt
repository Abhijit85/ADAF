=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals notable changes in asset categories and depreciation impacts over the fiscal years 2017 to 2019.

1. **Asset Increases**: Total assets rose by $2464, from $33562 to $36026, driven by significant increases in software ($4542) and furniture and equipment ($933).

2. **Depreciation and Amortization**: Accumulated depreciation and amortization increased by $4138, from $16050 to $20188, reflecting ongoing depreciation expenses of $2.5M, $2.6M, and $2.4M for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

3. **Net Property and Equipment Decline**: Despite the overall asset increase, net property and equipment decreased by $1674, from $17512 to $15838, indicating that depreciation outpaced new capital investments.

4. **Project Expenditures**: There was a notable decrease in project expenditures not yet in use by $3173, from $4187 to $1014, suggesting a shift in capital allocation or project completion.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Furniture and equipment increased by $933 (11,604→10,671).
- [TREND] Software increased significantly by $4,542 (16,427→11,885).
- [TREND] Leasehold improvements showed a small increase of $162 (6,981→6,819).
- [TREND] Project expenditures not yet in use decreased by $3,173 (1,014→4,187).
- [TREND] Total assets increased by $2,464 (36,026→33,562).
- [TREND] Accumulated depreciation and amortization increased by $4,138 (20,188→16,050).
- [ANOMALY] Despite the increase in total assets, property and equipment, net decreased by $1,674 (15,838→17,512).
- [DEFINITION] "Depreciation expense" refers to the allocation of the cost of tangible assets over their useful lives.
- [SCOPE] Depreciation expenses were $2.5M, $2.6M, and $2.4M for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
- [SCOPE] Amortization expenses for capitalized internal-use software were $2.5M, $1.8M, and $1.4M for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017.
- [SOURCE] The company follows ASC 350-40 for capitalizing internal-use software as property and equipment.
- [NOTE] The context specifies fiscal years 2017, 2018, and 2019 for the reported expenses.
- [NOTE] Internal-use software is included under "property and equipment" in financial reporting.
