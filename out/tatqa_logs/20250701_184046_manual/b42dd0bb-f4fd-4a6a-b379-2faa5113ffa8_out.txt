=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals a mixed performance with improvements in gross profit but challenges in operational expenses and net loss.

1. Gross profit showed a positive trend, increasing from 45% in 2017 to 57% in 2019, while the cost of revenue decreased from 55% to 43% over the same period, indicating improved efficiency in revenue generation.
   
2. Despite these gains, research and development expenses surged to 120% in 2019, a significant jump from 79% in the previous two years, contributing to a worsening loss from operations, which fell to (149)% in 2019.

3. Selling, general, and administrative expenses also rose to 86% in 2019 from 79% in 2018, further straining profitability and contributing to an increased net loss of (151)% in 2019.

4. Interest expense remained low but increased slightly to (3)% in 2019, while interest income and other expense, net appeared at 2%, suggesting minor changes in financial costs and income.

- [ANOMALY] Research and development expenses spiked in 2019 to 120%, significantly higher than 79% in both 2018 and 2017.
- [RATIO] Loss from operations worsened in 2019 to (149)% compared to (108)% in 2018 and (115)% in 2017.
- [OUTLIER] Interest expense remained low but increased slightly in 2019 to (3)% from (1)% in both 2018 and 2017.

- [RATIO] Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 86% in 2019 from 79% in 2018, while it was 81% in 2017.
- [ANOMALY] Interest income and other expense, net appeared in 2019 at 2%, whereas it was 1% in 2018 and not present in 2017.
- [SCOPE] The table covers the years 2019, 2018, and 2017.
- [NOTE] Inflation and product price changes were "immaterial" in the specified years.
- [DEFINITION] "Percentage of revenue" refers to how much each item contributes to total revenue.
