=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of the federal income tax rates from 2017 to 2019 reveals significant changes due to tax reforms and non-recurring events. 

1. The statutory federal income tax rate was reduced from 35.0% in 2017 to 21.0% in 2018 and remained constant in 2019, reflecting the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).
2. The effective income tax rate showed a notable decrease from 18.3% in 2018 to 13.0% in 2019, influenced by a non-recurring tax benefit of approximately $2.2 billion in 2019.
3. An anomaly occurred in 2017 with a negative effective income tax rate of (48.3)%, primarily due to a substantial non-recurring, non-cash income tax benefit of $16.8 billion.
4. Non-deductible goodwill significantly decreased from 4.7 in 2018 to 0.1 in 2019, indicating a reduction in non-deductible charges impacting the effective tax rate.
