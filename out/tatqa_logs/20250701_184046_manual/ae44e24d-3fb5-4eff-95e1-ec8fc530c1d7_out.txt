=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The data reveals a significant decline in both Land and Ground leases and Building leases over the analyzed periods, with notable shifts in leasing ratios.

1. Land and Ground leases are projected to decrease from 381 in 2020–2024 to 40 in 2030–2034, marking a substantial reduction of 341 leases over the 15-year span.
2. Building leases show a similar downward trend, dropping from 697 in 2020–2024 to 135 in 2030–2034, a total reduction of 562 leases.
3. The ratio of Building to Land and Ground leases shifts dramatically from approximately 1.83:1 in 2020–2024 to 3.38:1 in 2030–2034, suggesting a strategic or market-driven change in leasing focus.
4. The increase in the ratio of Building to Land and Ground leases in 2030–2034 indicates a potential shift in leasing strategy or market conditions, possibly influenced by factors such as headquarters consolidation or changes in asset values.
