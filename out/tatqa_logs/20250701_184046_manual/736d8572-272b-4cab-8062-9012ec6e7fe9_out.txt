=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The aging analysis of trade receivables and contract assets as of December 31, 2019, reveals significant variations in past due amounts across different risk categories.

1. **Trend in Past Due Amounts**: Total past due amounts initially decrease with time but spike for accounts overdue by more than 360 days, with figures moving from 2821 (1–90 days) to 2447 (>360 days).

2. **High-Risk Country Exposure**: High-risk countries have a substantial portion of their past due amounts in the >360 days category, with 1315 out of 2480 total past due, indicating a potential credit risk.

3. **Medium-Risk Distribution**: Medium-risk countries show a more balanced distribution of past due amounts across all time categories, contributing the most to the overall total with 3035 out of 7427 (40.9%).

4. **Low-Risk Anomaly**: Despite being low-risk, these countries have a notable 16.4% of their past due amounts in the >360 days category, suggesting areas for further investigation.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Total past due increases with days: 2,821 (1–90) → 1,215 (91–180) → 944 (181–360) → 2,447 (>360)
- [RATIO] High-risk countries have a significant portion of >360 days past due: 1,315 out of 2,480 total (53.0%)
- [RATIO] Medium-risk countries have a balanced distribution across days: 891 (1–90), 725 (91–180), 600 (181–360), 819 (>360)
- [ANOMALY] Low-risk countries have a relatively high >360 days past due: 313 out of 1,912 total (16.4%)
- [OUTLIER] High-risk countries have the highest >360 days past due: 1,315 compared to 819 (Medium) and 313 (Low)
- [TREND] Low-risk countries show a sharp drop after 1–90 days: 1,347 (1–90) to 125 (91–180)
- [RATIO] Total past due for high-risk countries is 2,480, which is 33.4% of the overall total (7,427)
- [RATIO] Medium-risk countries contribute the most to the total past due: 3,035 out of 7,427 (40.9%)
- [SCOPE] "Aging analysis" pertains to "gross values by risk category" as of December 31, 2019.
- [SOURCE] Data reflects the distribution of trade receivables and contract assets.
- [NOTE] The ten largest customers accounted for 49% of total trade receivables and contract assets.
- [DEFINITION] "Distribution of trade receivables" aligns with the company's sales distribution.
- [WARNING] High customer concentration indicates potential credit risk exposure.
