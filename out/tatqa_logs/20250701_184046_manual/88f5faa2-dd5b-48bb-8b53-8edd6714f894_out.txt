=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In 2019, the company experienced significant increases in both products and licensing costs and technology development costs, impacting the overall cost structure.

1. Products and licensing costs surged by $8605302, a 106.5% increase from $8078870 to $16684172, largely due to $3.9 million and $4.4 million in costs from the legacy businesses of MOI and GP, respectively.

2. Technology development costs rose by $3248686, a 21.1% increase from $15400475 to $18649161, driven by higher direct labor and subcontractor costs.

3. The total costs of revenues increased by $11853988, a 50.5% rise from $23479345 to $35333333, with products and licensing costs now representing a larger share of total costs at 47.2%, up from 34.4% in 2018.

4. Conversely, technology development costs as a percentage of total costs decreased from 65.6% in 2018 to 52.8% in 2019, indicating a shift in the cost structure towards products and licensing.
