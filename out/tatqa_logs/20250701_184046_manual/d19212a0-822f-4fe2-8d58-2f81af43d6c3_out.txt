=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of stock-based compensation from 2018 to 2019 reveals significant changes in non-vested shares and their valuation.

1. Non-vested shares at the end of the year increased by 170843, from 315292 in 2018 to 486135 in 2019, indicating a substantial rise in shares yet to vest.
2. The Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value of these non-vested shares also rose by $0.27, from $2.26 in 2018 to $2.53 in 2019, reflecting an increase in the perceived value of the shares.
3. There was a notable decrease in shares vested, dropping by 241150 from 323420 in 2018 to 82270 in 2019, which significantly altered the ratio of shares granted to shares vested from approximately 0.62:1 in 2018 to 3.08:1 in 2019.
4. The unrecognized compensation cost for unvested RSUs stood at $0.8 million as of December 31, 2019, with expectations to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.3 years, indicating future financial implications.
