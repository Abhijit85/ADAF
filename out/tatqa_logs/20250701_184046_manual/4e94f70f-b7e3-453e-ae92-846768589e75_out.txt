=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial performance shows modest growth in sales and EBITDA, but there are concerns regarding profitability and efficiency metrics.

1. Sales increased by 3.7% from 1612 to 1671 million, with a normalized change of 1.8%, indicating steady growth, particularly highlighted by a 3.0% increase in Q4.
2. EBITDA rose by 3.5% from 361 to 372 million, with a normalized increase of 2.5%, reflecting improved operational efficiency despite a decrease in EBIT by 0.5% to 261 million.
3. Depreciation and amortization saw a significant rise of 9.9% from 102 to 111 million, which could impact future profitability if not managed.
4. The gross margin decreased by 55 bps from 84.2% to 83.6%, and the EBIT to sales ratio fell by 43 bps from 16.1% to 15.6%, suggesting pressure on profit margins amidst increased costs.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Sales increased by 3.7% (1,612→1,671 million) but normalized change is only 1.8%.
- [TREND] EBITDA rose by 3.5% (361→372 million) with a normalized increase of 2.5%.
- [ANOMALY] Depreciation and amortisation increased by 9.9% (102→111 million) with no difference between absolute and normalized change.
- [OUTLIER] Gross margin decreased by 55 bps (84.2%→83.6%) with a similar normalized decrease of 54 bps.
- [TREND] Cost of doing business slightly decreased by 12 bps (68.1%→68.0%) with a normalized decrease of 18 bps.
- [RATIO] EBIT to sales ratio decreased by 43 bps (16.1%→15.6%) with a normalized decrease of 35 bps.
- [TREND] Funds employed increased by 3.7% (1,995→2,068 million).
- [ANOMALY] ROFE decreased by 20 bps (13.1%→12.9%) with a larger normalized decrease of 38 bps.
- [SCOPE] "Hotels sales increased by 3.7% in F19" indicates the time range for sales growth.
- [DEFINITION] "Comparable sales increased by 1.9% with 3.0% growth in Q4" specifies quarterly sales performance.
- [NOTE] "Normalised gross profit declined by 54 bps" highlights the impact on profit margins.
- [WARNING] "Gaming sales continue to be more subdued" signals a potential area of concern.
- [SOURCE] "49 completed during the year" refers to the number of venue refurbishments.
- [NOTE] "EBIT of $261 million decreased by 0.5%" provides a specific EBIT figure and its change.
- [DEFINITION] "Normalised ROFE decreased by 38 bps" explains the return on funds employed metric.
