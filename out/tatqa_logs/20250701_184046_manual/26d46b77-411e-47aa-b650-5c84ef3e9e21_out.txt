=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of tax carryforwards as of August 31, 2019, reveals significant disparities between foreign and domestic figures, highlighting strategic considerations for tax planning.

1. Foreign income tax net operating loss carryforwards are notably higher at $565609 compared to domestic–state at $57299, resulting in a foreign to domestic–state ratio of approximately 9.87:1.
2. Domestic–federal tax credit carryforwards, amounting to $39784, are significantly greater than domestic–state at $3313, indicating a larger potential for future tax reduction at the federal level.
3. The expiration of domestic–state tax credit carryforwards in 2027 contrasts with domestic–federal's expiration in 2029, suggesting a need for timely utilization of state credits.
4. Anomalously, foreign tax credit carryforwards have an indefinite expiration option, unlike domestic ones, which could provide a strategic advantage in long-term tax planning.

Answer Echoes:
- [OUTLIER] Foreign income tax net operating loss carryforwards are significantly higher at $565,609 compared to domestic–state at $57,299.
- [TREND] Domestic–state tax credit carryforwards expire sooner in 2027 with an amount of $3,313, compared to domestic–federal which expires in 2029 with $39,784.
- [RATIO] The ratio of foreign to domestic–state income tax net operating loss carryforwards is approximately 9.87:1 ($565,609:$57,299).
- [ANOMALY] Foreign tax credit carryforwards have an indefinite expiration option, unlike domestic ones which have specific expiration years.
- [OUTLIER] Domestic–federal tax credit carryforwards at $39,784 are much higher than domestic–state at $3,313.
- [TREND] Both domestic–state and foreign tax credit carryforwards have the option of indefinite expiration, indicating a potential strategic advantage.
- [SCOPE] The data is relevant "as of August 31, 2019".
- [DEFINITION] "Net operating loss carryforwards" are amounts to reduce future taxes.
- [DEFINITION] "Tax credit carryforwards" are credits available to reduce future taxes.
