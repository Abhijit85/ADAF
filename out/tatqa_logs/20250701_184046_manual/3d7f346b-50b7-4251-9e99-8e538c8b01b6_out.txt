=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis for the years ended December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2018, reveals significant shifts in cash flow activities, highlighting changes in operating, investing, and financing activities.

1. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $60080, driven by a $103.7 million rise in total revenues, indicating improved operational efficiency and revenue generation.

2. Net cash used in investing activities surged by $618400, primarily due to $591.5 million in construction costs, reflecting substantial capital expenditures and investment in long-term assets.

3. Net cash provided by financing activities rose dramatically by $360855, largely attributed to a $244.2 million increase in borrowings, suggesting a strategic move to leverage debt for growth or expansion.

4. The change in net cash used in investing activities is approximately 10.3 times the change in net cash provided by operating activities, while the change in financing activities is about 6 times the change in operating activities, underscoring the scale of investment and financing relative to operational cash flow improvements.
