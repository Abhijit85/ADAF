=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial data reveals significant growth in various receivable categories, with notable anomalies and outliers impacting the overall trend.

1. **Indirect Taxes Surge**: Indirect taxes receivable saw a dramatic increase, particularly in 2019, jumping from $832 to $36821, marking it as an outlier and significantly affecting the total receivables ratio for that year ($36821/$90529).

2. **Consistent Growth in Unbilled Revenues**: Unbilled revenues, which include subscription fees and transaction charges, steadily increased from $7616 to $31629, indicating robust growth in these areas.

3. **Anomalies in Trade and Other Receivables**: Despite the general upward trend, trade receivables decreased from $11191 in 2018 to $9660 in 2019, and other receivables fell from $8620 to $6665, highlighting areas of concern.

4. **Overall Receivables Growth**: Total receivables increased significantly over the periods, from $21939 to $90529, driven largely by the surge in indirect taxes and unbilled revenues.
