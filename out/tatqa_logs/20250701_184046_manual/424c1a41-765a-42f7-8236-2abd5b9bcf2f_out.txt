=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of the allowance for doubtful accounts from 2017 to 2019 reveals significant trends and anomalies in financial management practices.

1. **Improvement in Beginning Balance**: The beginning balance showed a positive trend, improving from $(2.2) in 2017 to $(1.3) in 2019, indicating better management of uncollectible accounts over the years.

2. **Significant Increase in Bad Debt Expense**: There was a notable anomaly in 2019, with bad debt expense rising sharply to $(1.6) from $(0.6) in 2018, which is also higher than the $(0.8) recorded in 2017, suggesting potential issues with account collections or changes in estimation methods.

3. **Steady Increase in Write-offs**: Write-offs, net of recoveries, increased consistently from 1.1 in 2017 to 1.6 in 2019, reflecting a growing trend in accounts deemed uncollectible.

4. **Stable Ending Balance**: Despite fluctuations in other figures, the ending balance remained constant at $(1.3) from 2018 to 2019, indicating stability in the overall estimate of uncollectible accounts.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Beginning balance improved from $(2.2) in 2017 to $(1.3) in 2019.
- [ANOMALY] Bad debt expense increased significantly from $(0.6) in 2018 to $(1.6) in 2019.
- [TREND] Write-offs, net of recoveries, increased steadily from 1.1 in 2017 to 1.6 in 2019.
- [OUTLIER] Bad debt expense in 2019 $(1.6) is much higher compared to 2018 $(0.6) and 2017 $(0.8).
- [RATIO] Ending balance remained constant at $(1.3) from 2018 to 2019 despite fluctuations in other figures.
- [TREND] Ending balance improved from $(1.9) in 2017 to $(1.3) in 2018 and remained stable in 2019.
- [DEFINITION] "Allowance for doubtful accounts" is management's estimate of uncollectible balances.
- [SOURCE] Based on "known troubled accounts, historical experience and other currently available evidence."
- [SCOPE] Write-offs occur when collection likelihood is "considered remote."
- [NOTE] The rollforward is presented "in millions."
- [WARNING] Interpretation requires understanding of "historical experience" and current evidence.
