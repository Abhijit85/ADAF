=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals significant decreases in various inventory and asset categories, indicating potential shifts in operational focus or efficiency improvements.

1. Total inventories saw a notable decrease of $576k, from $3836k to $3260k, suggesting a reduction in stock levels or improved inventory management.
2. Work-in-process inventory decreased by $559k, from $2929k to $2370k, which may reflect streamlined production processes or a shift in production strategy.
3. An anomaly was observed in the software under property and equipment, which decreased by $999k, from $2788k to $1789k, possibly indicating a write-off or revaluation of software assets.
4. Total accrued liabilities decreased by $770k, from $1903k to $1133k, highlighting a reduction in outstanding obligations, which could improve liquidity or financial stability.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Total inventories decreased by $576k (3,836→3,260).
