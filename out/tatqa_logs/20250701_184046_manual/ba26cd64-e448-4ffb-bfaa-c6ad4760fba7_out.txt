=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals a positive trend in vessel values and liquidity, alongside a decrease in the loan-to-value ratio, indicating improved financial health and potential for future capital raising.

1. **Vessel Values and Borrowings**: Vessel values showed a consistent increase from 1661.1 to 1801.5 USDm, while borrowings also rose from 753.9 to 863.4 USDm, suggesting expansion and investment in assets.

2. **Loan-to-Value Ratio**: The LTV ratio decreased from 55.8% to 46.0%, reflecting a stronger asset base relative to debt, which enhances the company's ability to secure additional financing.

3. **Cash Flow Improvement**: Cash and cash equivalents improved significantly from -134.2 to -72.5 USDm, indicating better liquidity management and reduced financial strain.

4. **Capital Expenditure Anomaly**: There was a notable drop in committed CAPEX on newbuildings from 306.9 to 51.2 USDm, which may suggest a strategic shift or reduced investment in new projects.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Vessel values increased consistently: 1,661.1→1,675.1→1,801.5 USDm.
- [TREND] Borrowings increased over the period: 753.9→754.7→863.4 USDm.
- [ANOMALY] Significant drop in committed CAPEX on newbuildings: 306.9→258.0→51.2 USDm.
- [OUTLIER] Negative loans receivables in 2019: -4.6 USDm, not present in previous years.
- [TREND] Cash and cash equivalents improved: -134.2→-127.4→-72.5 USDm.
- [TREND] Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio decreased: 55.8%→52.9%→46.0%.
- [ANOMALY] Debt regarding land and buildings & other plant and operating equipment appears only in 2019: -8.7 USDm.
- [DEFINITION] LTV is "Vessel values divided by net borrowings on the vessels."
- [SCOPE] LTV is used to describe "the financial situation" and "liquidity risk."
