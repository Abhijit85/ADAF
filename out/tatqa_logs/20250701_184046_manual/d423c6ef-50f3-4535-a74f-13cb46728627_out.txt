=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals significant shifts in various cost components, highlighting areas of increased expenditure and potential savings.

1. **Acquisition and Finance Costs**: There was a notable reduction in costs associated with acquisitions, which decreased by 328 (572→244), and a slight decrease in interest and finance charges by 1 (2→1), indicating improved financial efficiency in these areas.

2. **Lease and Rent Expenses**: Office rent and total expenses related to operating leases saw substantial increases of 801 (3538→4339) and 752 (3650→4402) respectively, suggesting a rise in operational costs that may impact overall profitability.

3. **Research and Development**: Investment in research and development increased by 685 (17793→18478), reflecting a strategic focus on innovation and long-term growth, although these costs are expensed as incurred.

4. **Anomalous Trends**: Despite the general increase in operating lease expenses, motor vehicle lease expenses decreased by 45 (96→51), presenting an opportunity to explore cost-saving measures in other lease categories.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Costs associated with acquisitions decreased significantly by 328 (572→244).
- [TREND] Interest and finance charges paid/payable decreased by 1 (2→1).
- [TREND] Unwinding of the discount on provisions increased by 139 (60→199).
- [TREND] Office rent increased by 801 (3,538→4,339).
- [TREND] Total expense relating to operating leases increased by 752 (3,650→4,402).
- [TREND] Post-employment benefits: defined contribution increased by 299 (1,870→2,169).
- [TREND] Research and development costs incurred increased by 685 (17,793→18,478).
- [ANOMALY] Motor vehicle lease expenses decreased by 45 (96→51), which is contrary to the general increase in other operating lease expenses.
- [DEFINITION] "Operating lease payments" are charged on a "straight-line basis over the term of the lease."
- [DEFINITION] "Finance costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred."
- [DEFINITION] "Expenditure on research activities" is recognized as an expense "when it is incurred."
- [DEFINITION] Development costs are "deferred where these costs are directly associated" with technology integration or development.
- [NOTE] Deferred costs are amortized "over the period of the expected benefit," ranging from "2 to 10 years."
- [WARNING] Costs are deferred only if "expected beyond any reasonable doubt to be recoverable."
