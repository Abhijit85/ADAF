=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of asset trends reveals significant changes in network equipment and depreciation, impacting the net value of property, plant, and equipment.

1. **Network Equipment Growth**: Network equipment saw a substantial increase of 131.3, rising from 3913.3 to 4044.6, indicating a strategic investment in technological infrastructure.

2. **Depreciation Impact**: Accumulated depreciation increased by 209.5, from (2755.1) to (2964.6), which contributed to the decrease in the net value of property, plant, and equipment by 63.2, despite a gross value increase of 146.3.

3. **Construction and Improvements**: While buildings and leasehold improvements rose by 10.2, construction in process decreased by 8.2, suggesting a shift from ongoing projects to completed assets.

4. **Depreciation Expense Trends**: The depreciation expense has been rising, with $290.2M in 2019, up from $239.6M in 2018 and $190.4M in 2017, reflecting increased asset utilization and aging infrastructure.

- [ANOMALY] Property, plant and equipment, net ↓63.2 (1,844.0→1,780.8) despite gross value ↑146.3 (4,599.1→4,745.4)
- [DEFINITION] "Depreciation expense" totaled $290.2M in 2019, $239.6M in 2018, $190.4M in 2017.
- [SCOPE] Depreciation related to "cost of providing services" was 87% in 2019, 85% in 2018, 84% in 2017.
- [SCOPE] Network equipment has "depreciable lives" ranging from 2 to 50 years.
- [NOTE] Majority of assets have depreciable lives between "7 to 25 years".
- [SOURCE] No "asset impairment losses" were recognized in 2019, 2018, or 2017.
