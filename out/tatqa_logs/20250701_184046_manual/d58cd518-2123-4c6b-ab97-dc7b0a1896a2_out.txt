=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of share options and restricted share units (RSUs) reveals significant trends and anomalies in the company's equity compensation over recent years.

1. **Decreasing Share Options**: The number of share options outstanding has consistently decreased from 8681 in 2017 to 6230 in 2018, and further to 6209 in 2019, indicating a reduction in this form of employee compensation.

2. **Significant RSU Increase**: Unvested RSUs saw a dramatic increase from 28 in 2017 to 33 in 2018, and then a substantial jump to 550 in 2019, marking a Δ of 517, which is an outlier compared to previous years.

3. **Exclusion from Net Loss Calculation**: Both outstanding options and unvested RSUs are excluded from the "net loss per ordinary share" calculation due to their anti-dilutive effect, as the company has been experiencing net losses.

4. **Consistent Exclusion Policy**: The exclusion of potentially dilutive shares from the net loss calculation has been consistently applied for the fiscal years ending March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Share options outstanding decreased consistently over the years: 8,681 (2017) → 6,230 (2018) → 6,209 (2019).
- [ANOMALY] Unvested RSUs increased significantly from 28 (2017) to 33 (2018), then to 550 (2019), showing a large jump in the last year.
- [OUTLIER] The increase in unvested RSUs from 33 (2018) to 550 (2019) is an outlier with a Δ of 517, indicating a substantial change compared to previous years.
- [DEFINITION] "Net loss per ordinary share" is calculated by dividing net loss by weighted-average ordinary shares.
- [SCOPE] The calculation excludes "outstanding options" and "unvested restricted share units (RSUs)".
- [NOTE] Exclusions are due to their inclusion being "anti-dilutive" because of net losses.
- [SCOPE] Exclusions apply to years ending March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.
- [WARNING] Potentially dilutive shares are omitted as their effect is anti-dilutive.
