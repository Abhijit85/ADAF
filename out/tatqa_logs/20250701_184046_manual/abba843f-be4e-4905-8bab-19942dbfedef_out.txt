=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial asset portfolio is heavily dominated by non-interest earning assets, which could impact the Group's interest income potential.

1. Non-interest earning assets make up a substantial portion of the portfolio, totaling 369.2 out of 431.9 (£m), indicating a limited capacity for generating interest income.
2. The Euro, US dollar, Renminbi, and other currencies all have significant shares of non-interest earning assets, with figures like 97.9 out of 115.9 (£m) for the Euro and 81.6 out of 98.4 (£m) for the US dollar, highlighting a consistent trend across currencies.
3. Fixed rate financial assets are notably low, comprising only 6.8 out of 431.9 (£m), suggesting a minimal exposure to interest rate risk from these assets.
4. The 'Other' category stands out with the highest total financial assets at 146.5 (£m), yet it also has a significant portion of non-interest earning assets, 130.7 out of 146.5 (£m), further emphasizing the portfolio's reliance on non-interest generating components.
