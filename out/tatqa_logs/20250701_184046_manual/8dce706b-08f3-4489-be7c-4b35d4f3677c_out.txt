=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of trade accounts receivable sales from 2017 to 2019 reveals a consistent increase in both sales and associated cash proceeds, alongside rising pre-tax losses. 

1. Trade accounts receivable sold increased from $2968 million in 2017 to $6751 million in 2019, indicating a strategic move towards liquidity through receivable sales.
2. Correspondingly, cash proceeds received from these sales rose from $2962 million in 2017 to $6723 million in 2019, maintaining a stable ratio of cash proceeds to receivables sold, approximately 0.998 in 2017 and 0.996 in 2019.
3. Pre-tax losses on the sale of receivables increased significantly, from $6 million in 2017 to $28 million in 2019, a 366.7% rise, highlighting a potential area of concern regarding the cost of liquidity.
4. The disproportionate increase in pre-tax losses compared to receivables sold, particularly from 2017 to 2018, suggests a need for closer examination of the terms and efficiency of these sales programs.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Trade accounts receivable sold increased consistently: $2,968 (2017) → $5,480 (2018) → $6,751 (2019).
- [TREND] Cash proceeds received also increased: $2,962 (2017) → $5,463 (2018) → $6,723 (2019).
- [TREND] Pre-tax losses on sale of receivables increased: $6 (2017) → $17 (2018) → $28 (2019).
- [RATIO] The ratio of cash proceeds to trade accounts receivable sold remained stable: 2017 ($2,962/$2,968 ≈ 0.998), 2018 ($5,463/$5,480 ≈ 0.997), 2019 ($6,723/$6,751 ≈ 0.996).
- [ANOMALY] The increase in pre-tax losses from 2017 to 2018 ($6 → $17) is proportionally larger than the increase in trade accounts receivable sold ($2,968 → $5,480).
- [OUTLIER] The pre-tax loss in 2019 ($28) is significantly higher compared to 2017 ($6), showing a 366.7% increase.
- [DEFINITION] "Trade accounts receivable sale programs" involve selling receivables for liquidity.
- [SOURCE] Amounts are "recorded to other expense" in financial statements.
- [SCOPE] The context pertains to figures "in millions".
- [NOTE] The information is part of the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
- [WARNING] Ensure figures align with "other expense" classification.
