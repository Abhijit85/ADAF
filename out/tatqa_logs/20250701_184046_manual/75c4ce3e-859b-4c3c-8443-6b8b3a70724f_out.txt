Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Net income increased significantly from $21,524 in 2018 to $53,330 in 2019.
- [ANOMALY] Interest expense, interest income, and other income, net shifted from a positive $503 in 2018 to a negative $(8,483) in 2019.
- [TREND] Stock-based compensation expense increased consistently: $7,413 (2017) → $13,429 (2018) → $20,603 (2019).
- [OUTLIER] Litigation expense in 2018 was exceptionally high at $45,729 compared to $12,754 in 2019 and $7,212 in 2017.
- [RATIO] Total adjustments to net income ratio in 2019 was 54,977/53,330 ≈ 1.03, indicating adjustments were slightly higher than net income.
- [TREND] Adjusted EBITDA increased steadily over the years: $71,628 (2017) → $93,081 (2018) → $108,307 (2019).
- [ANOMALY] Provision for income taxes swung from a benefit of $(9,825) in 2018 to an expense of $5,566 in 2019.

- [DEFINITION] Adjusted EBITDA excludes "interest expense, interest income, other income, net, provision for / (benefit from) income taxes."
- [SCOPE] Adjusted EBITDA is used to "evaluate core operating performance and trends" and for "executive bonus plan" performance measures.
- [SOURCE] The reconciliation table shows Adjusted EBITDA to "net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure."
- [NOTE] Adjusted EBITDA "does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements" or "changes in working capital needs."
- [WARNING] "Other companies...may calculate Adjusted EBITDA...differently," reducing its usefulness as a comparative measure.
