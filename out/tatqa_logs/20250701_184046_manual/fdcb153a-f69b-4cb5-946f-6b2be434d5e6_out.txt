=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis of restructuring activities from 2017 to 2019 highlights significant shifts in workforce reduction and facility costs.

1. Workforce reduction balance payable decreased significantly by 8455, from 10045 in 2017 to 1590 in 2018, indicating a substantial reduction in liabilities related to workforce restructuring.
2. In contrast, facility costs balance payable increased by 2062, from 1369 in 2017 to 3431 in 2018, reflecting a growing financial commitment to facility consolidations.
3. Cash payments for workforce reduction were notably high in 2018, amounting to 12342, contributing to the overall high total cash payments of 13969 for that year.
4. By 2019, the total balance payable had decreased by 7419, from 11414 in 2017 to 3995, suggesting effective management of restructuring liabilities over the period.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Workforce reduction balance payable ↓8,455 (10,045→1,590) from 2017 to 2018.
- [TREND] Facility costs balance payable ↑2,062 (1,369→3,431) from 2017 to 2018.
- [OUTLIER] Cash payments for workforce reduction in 2018 were significantly high at $12,342.
- [RATIO] Accruals and adjustments for facility costs in 2018 were more than double those for workforce reduction (3,775 vs. 3,432).
- [ANOMALY] Foreign exchange and other non-cash adjustments for workforce reduction were positive in 2018 ($455) but negative in 2019 ($-77).
- [TREND] Total balance payable ↓7,419 (11,414→3,995) from 2017 to 2019.
- [RATIO] In 2019, facility costs balance payable ($2,949) was nearly three times that of workforce reduction ($1,046).
- [OUTLIER] The total cash payments in 2018 were notably high at $13,969.
- [SCOPE] The plan covers "workforce reductions and facility consolidations".
- [SOURCE] "$41.9 million has been recorded within 'Special charges (recoveries)'".
- [TIME] The reconciliation covers "the year ended June 30, 2019 and 2018".
