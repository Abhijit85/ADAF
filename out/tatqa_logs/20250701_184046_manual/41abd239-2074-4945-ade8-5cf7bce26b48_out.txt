=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis highlights the contrasting market trends and financial risks associated with Apple and Huawei from 2017 to 2019.

1. **Trend Analysis**: Apple experienced a fluctuating trend with percentages of 34% in 2017, 36% in 2018, and a decrease to 32% in 2019, while Huawei showed an overall increasing trend from 11% in 2017 to 13% in 2019, despite a dip to 8% in 2018.
   
2. **Comparative Ratios**: In 2019, Apple's market percentage (32%) was more than double that of Huawei's (13%), and in 2018, Apple's percentage (36%) was 4.5 times Huawei's (8%).

3. **Financial Exposure**: Accounts receivable from Apple-related sales were significant, comprising 49% in 2019, 26% in 2018, and 40% in 2017, indicating substantial financial exposure to Apple.

4. **Risk Considerations**: The BIS restrictions on Huawei may heighten credit risks for accounts receivable, and the company is unable to predict the "scope or duration" of EAR restrictions on Huawei, adding uncertainty to future financial planning.
