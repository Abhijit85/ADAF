=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals significant changes in accounts receivable and deferred revenue, suggesting potential areas for further investigation.

1. Accounts receivable increased by $7117, from $90831 to $97948, indicating a substantial rise in outstanding payments owed to the company.
2. Deferred revenue (current) decreased by $618, from $5101 to $4483, and deferred revenue (non-current) decreased by $263, from $3707 to $3444, reflecting a reduction in revenue yet to be recognized.
3. The increase in accounts receivable ($7117) is significantly larger than the combined decrease in deferred revenue (current and non-current), which totals $881, highlighting a potential imbalance in revenue recognition and cash flow.
4. The company follows ASC 606 for revenue recognition, which involves a "five step approach," ensuring that revenue is recognized when control of a product transfers, yet the notable increase in accounts receivable suggests a need to review the effectiveness of this process.
