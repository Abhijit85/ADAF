=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In 2019, the company's trade accounts receivable and total receivables saw significant increases, raising questions about the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.

1. Trade accounts receivable rose by 104, from 1292 in 2018 to 1396 in 2019, while the allowance for doubtful accounts only increased by 1, from (15) to (16), indicating a potential underestimation of doubtful accounts.
2. The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of trade accounts receivable slightly decreased from 1.16% in 2018 to 1.15% in 2019, despite the increase in receivables.
3. Apple, the company's largest customer, contributed 17.6% to net revenues in 2019, down from 13.1% in 2018 and 10.5% in 2017, highlighting a decreasing dependency on a single customer.
4. In 2019, $75 million of trade accounts receivable were sold "without recourse," which may have impacted the company's receivables management strategy.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Trade accounts receivable increased by 104 (1,292→1,396) from 2018 to 2019.
- [TREND] Allowance for doubtful accounts increased by 1 ((15)→(16)) from 2018 to 2019.
- [TREND] Total receivables increased by 103 (1,277→1,380) from 2018 to 2019.
- [RATIO] Allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of trade accounts receivable was 1.15% in 2019 ((16/1,396)*100) and 1.16% in 2018 ((15/1,292)*100).
- [ANOMALY] The increase in trade accounts receivable (104) is not fully offset by the increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts (1), suggesting a potential underestimation of doubtful accounts.
- [DEFINITION] "No material bad debt expense" means negligible uncollectible accounts in 2017-2019.
- [SCOPE] Apple contributed 17.6%, 13.1%, and 10.5% to net revenues in 2019, 2018, and 2017.
- [SOURCE] Apple is the "Company’s largest customer" in the given years.
- [NOTE] $75 million of trade accounts receivable were sold "without recourse" in 2019.
