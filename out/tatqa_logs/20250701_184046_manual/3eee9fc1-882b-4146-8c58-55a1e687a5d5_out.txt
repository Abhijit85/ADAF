=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In 2019, the company experienced a significant increase in interest expenses, driven by various financial activities and adjustments.

1. The total interest expense rose by $621 million, from $723 million in 2018 to $1344 million in 2019, marking an 85.9% increase, which highlights a substantial rise in financial costs.
2. Operating (non-GAAP) interest expense also saw a notable increase of $393 million, from $723 million to $1116 million, representing a 54.4% rise, indicating a significant but smaller increase compared to the total interest expense.
3. An anomaly was observed with acquisition-related charges recorded at $(228) million in 2019, while no such charges were present in 2018, suggesting a unique financial event impacting the year's expenses.
4. The discrepancy between the total interest expense increase (85.9%) and the operating (non-GAAP) interest expense increase (54.4%) suggests potential anomalies in financial adjustments or calculations, warranting further investigation.
