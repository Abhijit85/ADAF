=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis focuses on the financial dynamics and structural aspects of a defined benefit plan, highlighting key quantitative and contextual insights.

1. The discount rate for the defined benefit plan decreased significantly by 0.9% from 3.8% in 2018 to 2.9% in 2019, potentially impacting the valuation of future liabilities.
2. Both the expected rate of salary increase and the rate of price inflation remained constant at 2.5% and 2.0%, respectively, indicating stable economic assumptions over the two years.
3. The plan is closed to new members, which may reduce future liabilities but also limits the inflow of new contributions, affecting the plan's long-term sustainability.
4. Assets are held in the "AMP SignatureSuper" sub-plan, which is legally separate from the Group, ensuring that the plan's assets are protected and managed independently.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Discount rate decreased by 0.9% (3.8%→2.9%) from 2018 to 2019.
- [RATIO] Expected rate of salary increase remained constant at 2.5% for both years.
- [RATIO] Rate of price inflation remained constant at 2.0% for both years.
- [DEFINITION] "Defined benefit plan" offers benefits based on salary and membership period.
- [SCOPE] The plan is "closed to new members," affecting future liabilities.
- [SOURCE] Assets held in "AMP SignatureSuper" sub-plan, legally separate from the Group.
- [NOTE] Valuation by "Mr Nicholas Wilkinson, FIAA, Willis Towers Watson."
- [SCOPE] Disclosures relate only to "defined benefit entitlements."
- [NOTE] Contributions set by "Trust Deed and Rules" and "Participation Deed."
