=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Interest expense increased by $57 million from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019, primarily due to higher average borrowings. 

1. The interest expense rose from $2025 million in 2018 to $2082 million in 2019, marking a consistent 3% increase in both actual and constant percentage terms.
2. The issuance of $10.0 billion in senior notes in November 2017 significantly contributed to the higher average borrowings, which drove the increase in interest expense.
3. This increase was partially offset by substantial repayments, with $2.0 billion repaid in fiscal 2019 and $6.0 billion in fiscal 2018, highlighting active debt management.
4. The changes in interest expense are primarily attributed to the dynamics of borrowings and repayments, with minimal influence from other factors.
