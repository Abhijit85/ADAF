=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals significant changes in interest and foreign exchange figures for the year ending March 31, 2018, compared to the previous year.

1. Interest income saw a substantial increase of $800, rising from $510 to $1310, marking a 157% growth, primarily due to interest on investments.
2. Interest expense also rose by $330, from $268 to $598, representing a 123% increase, which may impact net interest margins.
3. A notable anomaly occurred in foreign exchange and other net, which shifted from an income of $6892 to an expense of $(3439), a dramatic change of $(10331), driven by a $10.4 million foreign exchange expense related to the re-measurement of intercompany balances.
4. Consequently, total other income (expense), net, experienced a significant shift from $7134 to $(2727), a change of $(9861), highlighting the volatility in foreign exchange impacts.
