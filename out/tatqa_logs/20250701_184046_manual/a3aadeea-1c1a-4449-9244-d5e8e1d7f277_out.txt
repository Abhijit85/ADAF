=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals significant changes in benefit obligations and actuarial gains/losses from 2017 to 2019, highlighting key trends and anomalies in pension and post-retirement benefit plans.

1. **Benefit Obligation Increase**: The benefit obligation at the end of the year rose by $623 million from 2018 to 2019, increasing from $11594 million to $12217 million, indicating a growing financial commitment.

2. **Volatility in Actuarial Gains/Losses**: The actuarial (gain) loss exhibited notable volatility, with a substantial gain of $1249 million in 2019, contrasting sharply with a loss of $(765) million in 2018 and a gain of $586 million in 2017.

3. **Decreasing Benefits Paid**: Benefits paid from plan assets have consistently decreased over the years, from $(1238) million in 2017 to $(1115) million in 2019, reflecting a trend of reduced outflows.

4. **Interest Cost Fluctuations**: Interest costs have shown an upward trend, increasing from $392 million in 2018 to $436 million in 2019, after a slight decrease from $409 million in 2017.
