=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of RS Inc.'s defined benefit plans reveals significant trends and anomalies in cost components over recent years.

1. **Service and Interest Costs:** The service cost decreased from $2262 in 2018 to $1955 in 2019, while the interest cost consistently increased from $1086 in 2017 to $1308 in 2019, indicating a shift in the cost structure of the pension plans.

2. **Return on Plan Assets:** The expected return on plan assets became increasingly negative, moving from ($736) in 2017 to ($817) in 2019, suggesting a decline in asset performance or changes in assumptions.

3. **Actuarial Gains/Losses and Curtailment:** A notable shift occurred in recognized net actuarial gain/loss, transitioning from a loss of ($236) in 2017 to a gain of $470 in 2019. Additionally, a curtailment gain of ($1236) was recognized in 2018 due to a plan freeze.

4. **Net Periodic Pension Cost:** There was a significant increase in the net periodic pension cost from $1653 in 2018 to $2837 in 2019, a change of $1184, highlighting increased financial obligations.
