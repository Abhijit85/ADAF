=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The restructuring program across all segments, particularly Transportation and Industrial Solutions, is progressing with incurred charges closely aligning with expectations.

1. Transportation Solutions has a high incurred to expected ratio of 0.9 (144/160), indicating effective management of restructuring costs, though it also has the highest remaining expected charges at 16.
   
2. Industrial Solutions shows a lower incurred to expected ratio of 0.825 (66/80), yet its remaining expected charges (14) are nearly as high as those of Transportation Solutions, despite having lower total expected charges.

3. Communications Solutions has the highest incurred to expected ratio of 0.898 (44/49) but the lowest remaining expected charges at 5, suggesting efficient cost management in this segment.

4. Overall, the total incurred charges of $254 million are close to the total expected charges of $289 million, with an incurred to expected ratio of 0.879, and an additional $35 million in charges anticipated mainly for severance and exit costs by the end of fiscal 2021.

Answer Echoes:
- [RATIO] Transportation Solutions has a high incurred to expected ratio: 144/160 = 0.9.
- [RATIO] Industrial Solutions has an incurred to expected ratio of 66/80 = 0.825.
- [RATIO] Communications Solutions shows the highest incurred to expected ratio: 44/49 = 0.898.
- [TREND] Total incurred charges are close to total expected charges: 254/289 = 0.879.
- [ANOMALY] Remaining expected charges for Industrial Solutions (14) are close to Transportation Solutions (16) despite lower total expected charges.
- [OUTLIER] Transportation Solutions has the highest remaining expected charges at 16 compared to others.
- [OUTLIER] Communications Solutions has the lowest remaining expected charges at 5.
- [DEFINITION] "Restructuring charges" refer to costs related to "footprint consolidation and structural improvements".
- [SCOPE] The program impacts "all segments" but highlights Transportation and Industrial Solutions for additional charges.
- [SOURCE] Charges incurred in fiscal 2019 amount to "$254 million".
- [SCOPE] Completion of actions is expected by "the end of fiscal 2021".
- [NOTE] Additional charges of "$35 million" are expected, mainly for severance and exit costs.
- [WARNING] Ensure table aligns with the timeline and charge details provided.
