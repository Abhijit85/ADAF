=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of contractual obligations reveals a trend towards longer-term commitments over the next five years. 

1. Operating Lease Obligations are notably higher in the 2-5 Years category ($2055) compared to Less Than 1 Year ($773), indicating a strategic focus on longer-term leases.
2. Finjan Blue's future commitments are evenly distributed between Less Than 1 Year ($2000) and 2-5 Years ($2000), totaling $4000, suggesting balanced short- and medium-term financial planning.
3. An anomaly is observed where total obligations for Less Than 1 Year ($3423) are significantly lower than for 2-5 Years ($4055), contrary to typical expectations of higher short-term obligations.
4. The ratio of Operating Lease Obligations to Total Obligations stands at approximately 37.8% ($2828 out of $7478), highlighting the substantial role of lease commitments in the overall financial obligations.
