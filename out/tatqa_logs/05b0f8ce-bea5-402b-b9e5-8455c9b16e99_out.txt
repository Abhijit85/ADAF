=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The stock repurchase program has seen a notable increase in activity and cost per share over recent periods. 

1. Total shares purchased surged from 262 between January 26 and February 22 to 3380 in the following month, and further to 3608 by April 26, indicating a strong upward trend in repurchase activity.
2. The average price paid per share also rose, from $64.77 to $65.53, and then to $72.49, reflecting a higher cost of repurchasing shares over time.
3. Despite the increase in shares purchased, the approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased decreased from $2372 million to $1889 million, suggesting a diminishing budget for future repurchases.
4. An anomaly exists in the total number of shares purchased, which is reported as 7250, yet this figure does not align with the sum of shares purchased in individual periods (262 + 3380 + 3608 = 7250).

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Total shares purchased increased significantly: 262 (Jan 26 - Feb 22) → 3,380 (Feb 23 - Mar 22) → 3,608 (Mar 23 - Apr 26).
- [TREND] Average price paid per share increased over the periods: $64.77 → $65.53 → $72.49.
- [ANOMALY] The total number of shares purchased (7,250) does not match the sum of shares purchased in individual periods (262 + 3,380 + 3,608 = 7,250).
- [TREND] Approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased decreased: $2,372M → $2,150M → $1,889M.
- [OUTLIER] The initial period (Jan 26 - Feb 22) had a significantly lower number of shares purchased (262) compared to subsequent periods (3,380 and 3,608).
- [RATIO] The ratio of shares purchased to the remaining dollar value decreased over time: 262/$2,372M, 3,380/$2,150M, 3,608/$1,889M.
- [DEFINITION] "Stock repurchase program" approved by the Board in May 2003.
- [SCOPE] As of April 26, 2019, $13.6 billion authorized for repurchase.
- [SOURCE] $4.0 billion increase approved in April 2018.
- [NOTE] 313 million shares repurchased for $11.7 billion by April 26, 2019.
- [SCOPE] Repurchases can occur in open market or privately negotiated transactions.
- [WARNING] Program may be "suspended or discontinued at any time".
