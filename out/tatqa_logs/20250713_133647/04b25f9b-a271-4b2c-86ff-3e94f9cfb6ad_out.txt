=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In 2019, the company's total assets increased significantly, driven primarily by a rise in prepaid expenses and other assets.

1. 'Prepaid expenses and other' saw a substantial increase of $495 million, rising from $2083 million in 2018 to $2578 million in 2019, contributing significantly to the overall asset growth.
2. 'Other assets' experienced a smaller increase of $99 million, from $1812 million in 2018 to $1911 million in 2019, indicating a more modest impact on total asset growth.
3. The total assets increased by $594 million, from $3895 million in 2018 to $4489 million in 2019, with the rise in 'Prepaid expenses and other' being a major factor.
4. Deferred contract costs, classified within these asset categories, were amortized at $2.7 billion in 2019, up from $2.0 billion in 2018, with no impairment charges recognized in either year.
