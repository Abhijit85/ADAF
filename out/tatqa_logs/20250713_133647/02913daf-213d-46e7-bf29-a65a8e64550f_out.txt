=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals a significant increase in net financing costs, primarily due to adverse market conditions and strategic financial decisions.

1. Investment income decreased significantly from 685 to 433, resulting in a change of Δ = -252, impacting overall financial performance.
2. Financing costs rose sharply from (1074) to (2088), a change of Δ = -1014, reflecting increased interest costs associated with the Liberty Global transaction.
3. Net financing costs surged from (389) to (1655), a change of Δ = -1266, driven by mark-to-market losses and adverse foreign exchange rate movements.
4. Foreign exchange (losses)/gains shifted from 322 to (190), a change of Δ = -512, exacerbating the financial strain due to adverse interest rate movements on borrowings in foreign operations.

Answer Echoes:
- "Net financing costs increased by €1.3 billion, primarily driven by mark-to-market losses"
- "Adverse foreign exchange rate movements"
- "Increased interest costs as part of the financing for the Liberty Global transaction"
- "Adverse interest rate movements on borrowings in foreign operations"
