=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals notable changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities, alongside significant shifts in stock-based compensation and deferred revenue.

1. Gross deferred tax assets increased by $31, from $395 to $426, while total deferred tax liabilities rose by $15, from $89 to $104, indicating a net increase in deferred tax positions.
2. Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, grew by $17, from $286 to $303, but when accounting for deferred tax liabilities, the net increase was only $2, from $197 to $199.
3. Stock-based compensation saw a decrease of $6, from $22 to $16, and other deferred tax assets dropped by $13, from $29 to $16, highlighting areas of financial contraction.
4. Deferred revenue experienced a significant increase of $49, from $156 to $205, suggesting improved future revenue recognition.
5. The valuation allowance increased by $14 million, from $(109) to $(123), reflecting adjustments in anticipated future tax benefits.
