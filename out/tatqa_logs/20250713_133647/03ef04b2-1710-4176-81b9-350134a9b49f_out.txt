2. Forward foreign exchange contracts experienced a sharp decline, dropping from 1467 in 2018 to just 41 in 2019, suggesting a reduced reliance on these contracts.
3. Cross currency swaps, which were present at 1429 in 2018, were completely absent in 2019, marking a significant change in currency risk management strategies.
4. Total derivative liabilities rose substantially from 12092 in 2018 to 49932 in 2019, reflecting an overall increase in financial obligations.
5. The proportion of current liabilities to total liabilities decreased from 17.3% in 2018 to 16.2% in 2019, while non-current liabilities increased from 82.7% to 83.8%, indicating a shift towards longer-term financial commitments.
