=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Sales experienced a 5.0% increase, but profitability metrics showed declines, indicating operational challenges. 

1. Sales rose from 8244 to 8657, marking a 5.0% increase, partly boosted by New Year’s Day, which contributed an 84 bps increase in H2.
2. EBITDA decreased by 4.1%, from 603 to 579, reflecting increased operational costs.
3. Depreciation and amortisation rose by 20.1%, from (87) to (105), impacting EBIT, which fell by 8.2% to 474.
4. The gross margin slightly decreased by 16 bps to 22.9%, while the cost of doing business increased by 63 bps to 17.4%.
5. ROFE declined by 190 bps to 15.2%, driven by the EBIT decrease, despite a slight reduction in funds employed by 0.9%.
