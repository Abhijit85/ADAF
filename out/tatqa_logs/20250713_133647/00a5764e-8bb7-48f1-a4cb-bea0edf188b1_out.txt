=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial metrics from 2017 to 2019 reveal subtle shifts in dividend yield, expected volatility, and option term life, with a notable increase in the fair value of options.

1. The 'dividend yield' showed a slight decrease from 4.6% in 2018 to 4.5% in 2019, following an increase from 4.1% in 2017 to 4.6% in 2018.
2. 'Expected volatility' decreased from 28.7% in 2018 to 28.3% in 2019, after rising from 27.1% in 2017 to 28.7% in 2018.
3. The 'risk-free interest rate' remained constant at 2.5% from 2018 to 2019, after an increase from 2.0% in 2017 to 2.5% in 2018.
4. The 'expected life of the option term' decreased slightly from 4.4 years in 2018 to 4.3 years in 2019, continuing a downward trend from 4.5 years in 2017.
5. The weighted-average per share grant date fair value of options increased from $7.06 in 2017 to $8.45 in 2018, and further to $8.92 in 2019.
