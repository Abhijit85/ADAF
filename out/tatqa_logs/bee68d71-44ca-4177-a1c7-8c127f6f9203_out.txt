=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of equity-based compensation trends from 2017 to 2019 reveals significant changes in share values and vesting patterns.

1. **Increase in Non-Vested Shares**: There was a notable increase in non-vested shares from 1187586 to 1283281, marking a rise of 95695 shares, indicating a growing pool of shares awaiting vesting.

2. **Fair Value Trends**: The weighted-average grant date fair value of shares increased from $41.12 to $45.40, a rise of $4.28, suggesting an upward trend in the perceived value of the shares over the period.

3. **Vesting and Forfeiture Ratios**: Vested shares accounted for approximately 30.75% of the shares at the start of the period, while forfeited shares were a minor fraction at about 1.06%, highlighting a relatively stable vesting process with minimal forfeitures.

4. **Anomalies in Fair Value**: Granted shares had a significantly higher fair value of $53.53 compared to the starting fair value of $41.12, and forfeited shares had a fair value of $50.49, both exceeding the average fair values, indicating potential market volatility or strategic grant timing.

- [TREND] Increase in non-vested shares from 1,187,586 to 1,283,281 (Δ95,695)
- [TREND] Weighted-average grant date fair value increased from $41.12 to $45.40 (Δ$4.28)
- [RATIO] Vested shares represent approximately 30.75% of shares at the start of the period (365,223/1,187,586)
- [RATIO] Forfeited shares are a small fraction, about 1.06% of shares at the start of the period (12,632/1,187,586)
- [ANOMALY] Granted shares have a significantly higher fair value ($53.53) compared to the starting fair value ($41.12)
- [OUTLIER] Forfeited shares have a fair value of $50.49, which is higher than both the starting and ending average fair values
- [DEFINITION] "Weighted average per share grant date fair value" was $53.53 in 2019.
- [SCOPE] The data covers the years 2017, 2018, and 2019.
- [SOURCE] Fair value was determined using "the quoted market price" on the grant date.
- [NOTE] Total unrecognized compensation cost as of December 31, 2019, is $31.7 million.
- [NOTE] Unrecognized cost is expected to be recognized over 1.9 years.
- [WARNING] Ensure the table reflects "equity-based compensation expense" and "income tax benefit" figures accurately.
