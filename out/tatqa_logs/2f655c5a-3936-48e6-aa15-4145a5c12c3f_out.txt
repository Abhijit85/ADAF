=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's financial statement captions reveal a decrease in certain costs and assets between 2018 and 2020. 
1. Transition costs and project assets under other current assets in 2020 were less than $100 million, specifically $98 million. This indicates a reduction, although the exact amount of decrease from 2018 is not provided.
2. Pre-contract costs saw a significant decrease of $35 million, dropping from $41 million in 2018 to just $6 million in 2020. This suggests a substantial reduction in upfront expenses related to contracts.
3. Equity method investments also decreased over the two-year period, falling by $7 million from $26 million in 2018 to $19 million in 2020. This could reflect a strategic shift in investment approach or performance of these investments.
4. In 2020, the company combined "Dividends payable" and "Income taxes payable" with "Accounts payable and accrued liabilities", which may have implications for the interpretation of these liabilities. However, specific figures for these categories are not provided.
