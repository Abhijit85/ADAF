=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of accrued liabilities for April 30, 2019, compared to 2018 reveals notable trends and anomalies in compensation and revenue components.

1. **Compensation Trends**: Vacation and other compensation saw a significant increase of $226, rising from $1433 to $1659, while commissions also grew by $71, from $307 to $378. Conversely, incentive compensation decreased by $65, from $411 to $346, indicating a shift in compensation structure.

2. **Tax and Expense Changes**: Payroll taxes increased by $42, from $113 to $155, reflecting higher tax obligations. Meanwhile, other expenses decreased by $60, from $564 to $504, suggesting cost-saving measures or reduced operational costs.

3. **Revenue and Reserve Anomalies**: Deferred revenue, which was $68 in 2018, is notably absent in 2019, indicating a potential change in revenue recognition or collection. The warranty reserve remained stable with a minor increase of $9, from $520 to $529, showing consistency in warranty-related liabilities.
