=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The notes provide a comparison of various financial aspects between 2018 and 2019, including vacation and other compensation, incentive compensation, payroll taxes, and accrued liabilities. 

1. There was an increase in vacation and other compensation from $1433 in 2018 to $1659 in 2019, indicating a rise in employee benefits.
2. In contrast, incentive compensation decreased from $411 in 2018 to $346 in 2019, suggesting a possible reduction in performance-based rewards.
3. Payroll taxes also saw an increase from $113 in 2018 to $155 in 2019, with an average of $134 for the two years.
4. The total accrued liabilities, which are obligations the company has incurred but not yet paid, increased by $155 from 2018 to 2019.
5. In 2019, the warranty reserve constituted 14.81% of the total accrued liabilities, although the context does not provide information on the constitution of warranty reserve among total accrued liabilities in 2018. 

However, without specific amounts for any types of accrued liabilities, it's not possible to calculate averages, differences, or percentages accurately.
