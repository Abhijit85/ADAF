    "The negative balance in operating activities in 2019 was primarily caused by a net loss of $3.8 million, a capitalized debt discount of $13 thousand, and a loss on debt extinguishment of $2.6 million. These were partially offset by non-cash items such as share-based compensation expense ($108 thousand), debt discount and debt issue cost amortization expense ($66 thousand), depreciation expense ($66 thousand), and intangible asset amortization expense ($207 thousand).",
