    "The increase in prepared chicken inventory is attributable to the mix of different finished products in inventory at October 31, 2019, as compared to October 31, 2018, as well as an increase in production volume at the Company's prepared chicken facility in Flowood, Mississippi. During fiscal 2019, the facility processed approximately 129.1 million pounds of prepared chicken products, as compared to approximately 107.6 million pounds during fiscal 2018. Approximately 1.2 million pounds of that increase was in inventory at October 31, 2019, representing an approximately 12% increase in inventory volume.",
