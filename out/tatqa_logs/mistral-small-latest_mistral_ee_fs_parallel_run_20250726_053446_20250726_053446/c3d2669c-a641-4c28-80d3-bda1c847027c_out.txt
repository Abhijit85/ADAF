    "The decrease in the effective income tax rate from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to the recognition of approximately $2.2 billion of a non-recurring tax benefit in connection with the disposition of preferred stock, representing a minority interest in a foreign affiliate in 2019. This was compared to a non-recurring deferred tax benefit of approximately $2.1 billion in 2018, resulting from an internal reorganization of legal entities within the historical Wireless business, which was offset by a goodwill charge that is not deductible for tax purposes.",
