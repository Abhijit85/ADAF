=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Autodesk's restructuring plan, initiated in fiscal 2018, has led to significant reductions in termination and exit costs, reflecting effective cost management strategies.

1. Employee termination costs saw a dramatic decrease from $53.0 to $2.0, indicating a substantial reduction in workforce-related expenses.
2. Facility termination and other exit costs also dropped significantly from $2.5 to $0.1, showcasing efficient handling of facility closures.
3. Payments for employee terminations ($89.7) and facility terminations ($5.7) exceeded their respective additions, highlighting a focus on settling existing obligations.
4. The total payments of $(95.4) surpassing total additions of $42.4 resulted in a net decrease in balances, underscoring the financial impact of the restructuring efforts.
