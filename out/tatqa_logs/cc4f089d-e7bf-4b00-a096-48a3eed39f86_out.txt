=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis highlights key financial trends and metrics affecting stock options over recent fiscal years.

1. The expected life of stock options has decreased by 0.2 years, from 4.8 to 4.6 years, indicating a shift in exercise patterns and termination behavior.
2. The risk-free interest rate has seen a significant increase of 1.7%, rising from 1.0% to 2.7%, which impacts the valuation of stock options using the Black-Scholes-Merton model.
3. Volatility has shown fluctuations, moving from 23% to 22% and then to 24%, reflecting changes in market conditions and affecting option pricing.
4. The weighted-average fair value per share has increased by $2.59, from $8.18 to $10.77, suggesting an overall rise in the perceived value of stock options.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Expected life ↓0.2 years (4.8→4.6)
- [TREND] Risk-free interest rate ↑1.7% (1.0%→2.7%)
- [TREND] Volatility shows fluctuation: 23%→22%→24%
- [TREND] Dividend yield ↑0.2% (1.5%→1.7%)
- [TREND] Weighted-average fair value per share ↑$2.59 ($8.18→$10.77)
- [RATIO] Dividend yield remained constant from 2017 to 2018 at 1.5%
- [ANOMALY] Risk-free interest rate doubled from 2017 to 2018 (1.0%→2.0%)
- [DEFINITION] "Fair values of stock options" estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton model.
- [SCOPE] Assumptions include "stock price volatility" and "risk-free interest rate" based on U.S. Treasury instruments.
- [NOTE] "Expected life input" derived from historical exercise patterns and termination behavior.
- [SOURCE] "Volatility input" calculated from "implied volatility of publicly traded options."
- [SCOPE] Fiscal years covered: 2019, 2018, and 2017 for service-based stock options.
- [NOTE] PSOs in fiscal 2018 valued at ~$10/share using Monte Carlo simulation.
