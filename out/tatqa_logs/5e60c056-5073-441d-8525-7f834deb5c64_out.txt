=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis highlights shifts in credit risk exposure, particularly in trade receivables and payment timelines. 

1. The proportion of trade receivables due 'up to three months' decreased by 2.2 points (32.1→29.9), indicating a shift in payment timelines.
2. A significant increase of 6.3 points (3.7→10.0) in the 'three to six months' category suggests a growing delay in payments, marking a 170% rise.
3. The overall 'trade receivables' increased by 4.1 points (35.8→39.9), reflecting a broader expansion in credit exposure.
4. The ratio of 'up to three months' to 'trade receivables' dropped from approximately 0.90 in 2018 to 0.75 in 2019, indicating a relative increase in longer-term receivables.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] 'Up to three months' decreased by 2.2 (32.1→29.9)
- [TREND] 'Three to six months' increased significantly by 6.3 (3.7→10.0)
- [TREND] 'Trade receivables' increased by 4.1 (35.8→39.9)
- [RATIO] 'Up to three months' to 'Trade receivables' in 2019 is 29.9/39.9 ≈ 0.75
- [RATIO] 'Up to three months' to 'Trade receivables' in 2018 is 32.1/35.8 ≈ 0.90
- [ANOMALY] 'Three to six months' shows a large increase of 170% (3.7→10.0)
- [DEFINITION] "Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a tenant or counterparty fails to meet an obligation."
- [SCOPE] Credit risk arises from "trade receivables" and "other financial assets with counterparties."
- [NOTE] Tenants are "invoiced quarterly in advance" and managed individually by asset managers.
- [NOTE] Deposits or guarantees may be obtained; £3.5 million held as collateral at 31 December 2019.
