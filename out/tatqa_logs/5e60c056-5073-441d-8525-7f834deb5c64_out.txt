=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's total trade receivables increased by £4.1m from 2018 to 2019, with a significant portion of these receivables being three to six months old in 2019. 

1. The total trade receivables saw a rise from £35.8m in 2018 to £39.9m in 2019, marking an increase of £4.1m. 
2. In 2019, 25.06% of the trade receivables were aged between three to six months, calculated as (10.0/39.9*100). 
3. Interestingly, the trade receivables up to three months old were higher in 2018 (32.1) compared to 2019 (29.9), indicating a shift in the age profile of receivables. 
4. The company manages its credit risk, defined as the risk of financial loss if a tenant or counterparty fails to meet an obligation, primarily through monitoring trade receivables. This includes invoicing tenants quarterly in advance, obtaining deposits or guarantees, and considering factors such as days past due, credit status of the counterparty, and historical evidence of collection when assessing expected credit losses. The amount of deposits held as collateral at the end of both 2019 and 2018 was £3.5 million.
