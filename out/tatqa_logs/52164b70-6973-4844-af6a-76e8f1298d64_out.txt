=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's domestic discount rate increased while the international expected return on plan assets decreased between 2018 and 2019. 

1. The domestic discount rate, which is determined by comparing against the FTSE pension liability index for AA rated corporate instruments, increased by 0.25 percentage points from 3.75% to 4.00% between 2018 and 2019. 
2. On the other hand, the international expected return on plan assets, determined by comparing against country specific AA corporate indices, decreased by 0.30 percentage points from 3.70% to 3.40% in the same period. 
3. These actuarial assumptions, which the periodic benefit cost and the actuarial present value of projected benefit obligations are based on, are reviewed annually. 
4. The company revises these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of long-term trends and market conditions. However, the context does not provide specific numbers, columns, or time ranges for the discount rates or the year on year percentage changes.

Answer Echoes:
