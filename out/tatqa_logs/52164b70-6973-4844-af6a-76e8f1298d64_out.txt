=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In 2019, there were notable shifts in both domestic and international pension plan metrics, reflecting broader market trends and conditions.

1. The domestic discount rate saw an increase of 0.25% from 3.75% to 4.00%, indicating a potential rise in the cost of pension liabilities for domestic plans.
2. Conversely, the international discount rate experienced a significant decrease of 0.90% from 2.80% to 1.90%, which could lower the present value of future pension obligations internationally.
3. The expected return on plan assets for international plans decreased by 0.30% from 3.70% to 3.40%, suggesting a more conservative outlook on investment returns.
4. Anomalies were noted, such as the absence of expected return data for domestic plan assets and missing rate of compensation increase figures for international plans, which could impact the accuracy of financial reporting.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Domestic discount rate increased by 0.25% (3.75%→4.00%) from 2018 to 2019.
- [TREND] International discount rate decreased by 0.90% (2.80%→1.90%) from 2018 to 2019.
- [ANOMALY] Expected return on plan assets is missing for domestic figures in both years.
- [TREND] International expected return on plan assets decreased by 0.30% (3.70%→3.40%) from 2018 to 2019.
- [ANOMALY] Rate of compensation increase is not provided for international figures in both years.
- [DEFINITION] "Discount rate" is based on the FTSE pension liability index for AA rated corporate instruments.
- [SCOPE] Applies to both domestic and international pension plans.
- [SOURCE] International rates use "country specific AA corporate indices" adjusted for obligation duration.
- [NOTE] Assumptions are reviewed and revised annually based on "longterm trends" and "market conditions".
- [WARNING] Ensure pension obligations are "fairly reported on a consistent basis".
