=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's intangible assets, consisting of customer relationships and underlying rights, experienced a net total of $16.4 million and an amortization of $94 million for the year ending June 30, 2019. 

1. The company's intangible assets are divided into two categories: customer relationships and underlying rights and other. The latter includes certain rights and certifications with indefinite lives.
2. The net total underlying rights and other for both finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of June 30, 2019, amounted to $16.4 million. This figure is the sum of $1.9 million and $14.5 million.
3. The company's intangible assets underwent an amortization of $94 million for the year ending June 30, 2019. This figure is derived from the difference between $500.2 million and $406.2 million.
4. The amortization periods for the company's customer relationships asset and underlying rights are 14.3 years and 13.0 years, respectively. This process refers to the gradual reduction of an intangible asset's value over time.
