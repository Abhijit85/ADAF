=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of intangible assets reveals significant changes in customer relationships and underlying rights, impacting overall asset valuation.

1. **Amortization Increase**: Customer relationships amortization rose by $93.1 million, from $405.6 million to $498.7 million, indicating accelerated expense recognition over the asset's 14.3-year amortization period.

2. **Net Value Decline**: The net value of customer relationships decreased by $92.5 million, from $1191.4 million to $1098.9 million, reflecting the impact of amortization on asset valuation.

3. **Overall Asset Reduction**: Total finite-lived intangible assets' net value fell by $92.7 million, from $1193.5 million to $1100.8 million, driven by increased accumulated amortization, which rose by $94.0 million, from $406.2 million to $500.2 million.

4. **Ratio Decline**: The customer relationships net to gross ratio dropped from 74.6% to 68.8%, highlighting a relative decrease in net asset value compared to its gross carrying amount.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Customer relationships amortization increased by $93.1 million (405.6→498.7)
- [TREND] Net value of customer relationships decreased by $92.5 million (1,191.4→1,098.9)
- [TREND] Total finite-lived intangible assets net value decreased by $92.7 million (1,193.5→1,100.8)
- [TREND] Accumulated amortization for finite-lived intangible assets increased by $94.0 million (406.2→500.2)
- [OUTLIER] Underlying rights and other (finite-lived) gross carrying amount increased by $0.7 million (2.7→3.4)
- [OUTLIER] Underlying rights and other (finite-lived) accumulated amortization increased by $0.9 million (0.6→1.5)
- [ANOMALY] Indefinite-lived underlying rights and other decreased by $0.6 million (15.1→14.5)
- [RATIO] Customer relationships net to gross ratio decreased from 74.6% (1,191.4/1,597.0) to 68.8% (1,098.9/1,597.6)
- [DEFINITION] "Customer relationships asset" has a 14.3-year amortization period.
- [DEFINITION] "Underlying rights (including easements)" have a 13.0-year amortization period.
- [SCOPE] Amortization figures are for fiscal years ending June 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017.
- [SOURCE] Amortization amounts: $95.1M (2019), $97.2M (2018), $80.0M (2017).
