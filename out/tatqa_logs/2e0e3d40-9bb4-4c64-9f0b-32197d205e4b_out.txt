=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The deferred compensation plan assets have seen an increase, with accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities summing up to $35 in 2019. 
1. The deferred compensation plan assets have increased by $4, from $31 to $35. This indicates a positive trend in the company's ability to defer compensation for its employees.
2. The sum of accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities in 2019 was $35. This could suggest a balanced financial situation, as the increase in deferred compensation plan assets matches the total of these liabilities.
3. There was a 16% increase in other long-term liabilities between 2018 and 2019. This anomaly could be due to various factors, such as increased operational costs or investments.
4. The non-qualified deferred compensation plan allows a group of U.S. employees to contribute their base salary and other forms of compensation on a tax-deferred basis, with contributions exceeding the IRS limits imposed on 401(k) plans. This could be a significant benefit for employees, potentially leading to higher job satisfaction and retention rates.
