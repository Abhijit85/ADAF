=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities from April 2018 to April 2019 reveals notable financial trends and ratios. 

1. Deferred compensation plan assets increased by $4 million, from $31 million to $35 million, indicating growth in the plan's funding over the year.
2. Other long-term liabilities also rose by $4 million, from $25 million to $29 million, suggesting an increase in the company's long-term financial obligations.
3. The ratio of deferred compensation plan assets to total deferred compensation liabilities remained stable at 1:1 for both 2018 and 2019, with assets and liabilities both at $31 million and $35 million, respectively.
4. Despite these changes, accrued expenses stayed constant at $6 million, highlighting a stable component in the company's financial structure amidst other fluctuations. 

These insights reflect the financial dynamics of the non-qualified deferred compensation plan, which is subject to different tax and regulatory treatments compared to qualified plans.
