=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

IMFT's financial restructuring reflects significant shifts in debt and asset management, impacting its operational dynamics. 

1. Cash and equivalents saw a notable increase of $39, rising from $91 to $130, contributing to a $52 increase in total current assets, which now stand at $391.
2. A dramatic rise in current debt by $676, from $20 to $696, contrasts with a substantial decrease in long-term debt by $1011, from $1064 to $53, indicating a shift in debt structure.
3. Total liabilities decreased by $396, from $1305 to $909, yet the ratio of current liabilities to total liabilities surged from 12.8% to 93.6%, highlighting a potential liquidity risk.
4. The decrease in property, plant, and equipment by $406, from $2641 to $2235, alongside a $361 reduction in total assets, from $3025 to $2664, suggests a strategic divestment or asset revaluation.
