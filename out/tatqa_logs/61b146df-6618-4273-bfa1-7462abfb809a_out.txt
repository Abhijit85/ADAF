=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial data indicates a robust upward trend in gross profit and adjusted gross margin from 2017 to 2019, alongside notable fluctuations in stock-based compensation.

1. Gross profit showed a significant upward trajectory, increasing from $72849 in 2017 to $137347 in 2019, with the largest annual increase of $37063 occurring between 2018 and 2019.
   
2. Adjusted gross margin mirrored this growth, rising from $75041 in 2017 to $141427 in 2019, reflecting the company's enhanced core operating performance.

3. Amortization of acquired intangibles as a percentage of gross profit decreased from 2.21% in 2017 to 1.26% in 2019, indicating improved efficiency in managing intangible assets.

4. Stock-based compensation experienced a notable spike in 2018, increasing to $2306 from $578 in 2017, before decreasing to $1966 in 2019, suggesting a temporary strategic shift in employee compensation.
