=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's adjusted gross margin, a non-GAAP measure used to evaluate core operating performance, has been influenced by various factors including gross profit, amortization of acquired intangibles, and stock-based compensation. 
1. The gross profit has shown a consistent upward trend from 2017 to 2019, with values of $72849, $100284, and $137347 respectively, resulting in an average gross profit of $103493.33 over these three years.
2. The amortization of acquired intangibles was reported to be lower than 2000 thousands in 2018 and 2017, however, the exact figures were not provided.
3. Stock-based compensation decreased by 340 from 2018 to 2019, moving from $2306 to $1966.
4. Despite these figures, the company anticipates that expenses will continue to negatively impact the gross profit in the near term. It's also important to note that adjusted gross margin should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial results.
