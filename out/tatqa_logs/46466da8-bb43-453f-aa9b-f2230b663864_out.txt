=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial adjustments for the period ending March 31, 2018, reveal significant changes in tax-related figures and liabilities, influenced by the adoption of ASC 606.

1. **Net Operating Loss and Valuation Allowance**: Net operating loss carry forwards decreased by $36078, from $115064 to $78986, while the valuation allowance saw a substantial reduction of $112743, from $171401 to $58658, indicating improved financial positioning and potential future profitability.

2. **Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities**: Total deferred tax assets before valuation allowance decreased by $55190, from $197463 to $142273, while total deferred tax liabilities increased by $8114, from $27283 to $35397. This resulted in net deferred tax assets (liabilities) improving by $49439, shifting from a negative $1221 to a positive $48218.

3. **Anti-trust and Restructuring Costs**: Anti-trust fines and settlements dropped dramatically by $15665, from $16575 to $910, and accrued restructuring decreased sharply by $2082, from $2551 to $469, reflecting reduced legal and restructuring expenses.

4. **Stock-based Compensation**: There was a notable increase in stock-based compensation by $3824, from $1765 to $5589, suggesting a strategic shift towards incentivizing employees through equity.
