=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial table reveals significant changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between 2018 and 2019. 

1. There was an anomaly in the 'Other' component for 2018, which was not adjusted according to the table. 
2. The medical and employee benefits in 2019 amounted to $35298, but the context does not provide specific details about this component.
3. There was a notable decrease in total deferred tax assets from $197463 in 2018 to $142273 in 2019, indicating a downward trend.
4. Stock-based compensation, which exceeded $2000 thousand only in 2019, is identified as an outlier. However, the context does not provide information on the number of years this compensation exceeded this amount.
5. The percentage change in the Net deferred tax assets (liabilities) between 2018 and 2019 was a staggering 4050.45%, but the context does not provide information on this significant change. 

Despite these insights, the context lacks specific numbers or details about the components and does not provide information on changes in total deferred tax assets between years.
