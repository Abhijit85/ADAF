=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's financial performance in 2018 and 2019 showed a decrease in revenue and Adjusted EBITDA margin, with an average order value of €19213 million. 
1. The average orders for 2018 and 2019 were €19213 million, with a slight increase in 2019 (€19975 million) compared to 2018 (€18451 million).
2. However, the company's revenue decreased by 3% from 2018 (€18125 million) to 2019 (€17663 million), and the Adjusted EBITDA margin also decreased by 0.2% over the same period (4.0% to 3.8%).
3. The decline in Adjusted EBITDA was attributed to lower revenue, price declines, and reduced capacity utilization, but the table does not provide a specific reason for this decline.
4. Despite the challenges in the power generation market and the gas turbine market, the company expects growth in the oil and gas markets in fiscal 2020, driven by the liquefied natural gas and upstream markets. However, the table does not provide any rationale for this projection.
