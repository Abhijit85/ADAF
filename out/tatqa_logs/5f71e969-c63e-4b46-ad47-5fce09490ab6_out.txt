=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In 2019, the company experienced mixed financial performance, with an increase in orders but a decline in revenue and profitability.

1. Orders rose by 8% from €18451 million in 2018 to €19975 million in 2019, driven by growth in the new-unit business across all reporting regions.
2. Despite the increase in orders, revenue fell by 3% from €18125 million to €17663 million, highlighting a potential issue in converting orders to revenue, particularly in Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East, and Asia, Australia.
3. The service business showed resilience with a 3% revenue increase from €7756 million to €8025 million, contrasting with the overall revenue decline.
4. Profitability was impacted, as evidenced by a 6% decrease in adjusted EBITA from €722 million to €679 million, and a slight drop in the adjusted EBITA margin from 4.0% to 3.8%, attributed to lower revenue and price declines.
