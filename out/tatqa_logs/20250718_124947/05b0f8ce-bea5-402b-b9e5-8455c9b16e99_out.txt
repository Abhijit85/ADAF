### Contextual Insights:
- The Board of Directors' approval in 2003 is not specified in the table data, indicating a need for additional context from textual sources.
- The number of shares purchased in the first month was relatively small compared to the subsequent months, highlighting a significant increase in share repurchase activity as the program progressed.
- The increase in the average price paid per share from the first to the second month suggests a possible rise in market value or strategic timing in the repurchase program.
- The consistent increase in the number of shares purchased from the second to the third month reflects an aggressive approach in the share repurchase strategy.
- The first month's share purchases accounted for a small percentage of the total shares purchased over the three-month period, indicating that the bulk of the repurchase activity occurred later.
