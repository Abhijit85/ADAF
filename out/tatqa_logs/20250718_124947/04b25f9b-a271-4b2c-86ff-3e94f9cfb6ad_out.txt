- **What was the amortization and deferred cost expense in 2018?**
- **Answer**: Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs.
- **Were there any impairment charges in 2019 and 2018?**
- **Answer**: Unable to answer solely from table, need context from paragraphs.
- **What was the change in the prepaid expenses and other from 2018 to 2019?**
- **Extraction**: Prepaid expenses and other in 2019 = $2,578 million, in 2018 = $2,083 million
- **Calculation**: $2,578 million - $2,083 million = $495 million
