### Contextual Insights

- **Valuation Allowance Increase**: The increase in valuation allowance typically indicates a reassessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets, often due to changes in expected future taxable income or tax planning strategies.
  
- **Reserves and Accruals**: The $50 million in reserves and accruals for 2019 reflects the company's financial provisions for future liabilities or expenses, which can impact cash flow and financial planning.

- **Net Operating Loss and Credit Carryforwards**: The $131 million in 2018 represents potential future tax benefits that the company can use to offset taxable income, enhancing cash flow management.

- **Deferred Tax Liabilities Change**: The $4 million decrease in other deferred tax liabilities suggests a reduction in future tax obligations, potentially due to changes in tax laws or asset revaluation.

- **Gross Deferred Tax Assets**: The consistent exceeding of $400 million in gross deferred tax assets over two years indicates a substantial amount of future tax benefits, which can be a strategic financial asset.

- **Total Deferred Tax Liabilities Increase**: The 16.85% increase in total deferred tax liabilities from 2018 to 2019 may reflect changes in tax regulations, asset revaluations, or business operations impacting future tax obligations.
