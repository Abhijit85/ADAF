=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of share activity from 2017 to 2019 reveals significant trends and anomalies in the company's equity management.

1. **Outstanding Shares Reduction**: There was a notable decrease in outstanding shares from 2719.1 in 2018 to 2228.3 in 2019, marking a reduction of 490.8, which may indicate strategic buybacks or cancellations.

2. **Increase in Shares Granted**: The number of shares granted increased steadily over the years, from 866.6 in 2017 to 1001.1 in 2019, suggesting a growing commitment to employee compensation through equity.

3. **Anomalies in Exercised and Exercisable Shares**: Shares exercised were only reported in 2019 with a figure of -529.4, while exercisable shares were only noted in 2017 and 2018 at 255.3, indicating potential reporting inconsistencies or changes in policy.

4. **Significant Expiry and Forfeiture**: Shares expired rose sharply from -233.9 in 2017 to -785.3 in 2019, and forfeited shares increased from -21.3 in 2017 to -177.2 in 2019, reflecting higher non-fulfillment of vesting conditions or strategic adjustments in share-based compensation plans.
