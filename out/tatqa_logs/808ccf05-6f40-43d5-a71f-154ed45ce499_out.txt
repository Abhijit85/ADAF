=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis for the years ending December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2019, highlights significant changes in expenses and operational losses, alongside notable NAV fluctuations.

1. Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased by $8.6 million from $33.5 million in 2018 to $24.9 million in 2019, primarily due to reductions in bonus expenses, consulting and professional service fees, and employee wages and benefits.

2. The loss from operations also decreased by $8.6 million, from $(33.6) million in 2018 to $(25.0) million in 2019, indicating a direct relationship between reduced expenses and improved operational performance.

3. Despite these changes, depreciation and amortization remained constant at $0.1 million for both years, suggesting stability in asset valuation amidst other financial shifts.

4. The NAV experienced a stark contrast, with a 21% growth in 2018 followed by a 26.1% decline in 2019, attributed to external events impacting the Insurance segment, which could affect future financial expectations.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $8.6 (2018: $33.5 → 2019: $24.9).
- [TREND] Loss from operations decreased by $8.6 (2018: $(33.6) → 2019: $(25.0)).
- [RATIO] The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses ($8.6) matches the decrease in loss from operations ($8.6), suggesting a direct relationship between these two figures.
- [ANOMALY] Depreciation and amortization remained constant at $0.1 for both years, showing no change despite other financial fluctuations.
- [OUTLIER] The absolute value of the loss from operations in both years is significantly higher than the other figures, indicating a major area of concern.
- [SCOPE] The analysis covers the years ending December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2019.
- [DEFINITION] "Compensation NAV" is calculated using a specific formula involving NAV per share and a hurdle rate.
- [NOTE] A "21%" NAV growth in 2018 contrasts with a "26.1%" decline in 2019.
- [SOURCE] Expense decrease driven by "reductions in bonus expense, consulting and professional service fees, and employee wage and benefits."
- [WARNING] The 2019 NAV decline was due to "external events" in the Insurance segment affecting future expectations.
