=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals a significant decline in profitability and efficiency for the period indicated.

1. Gross profit decreased by 10.9, from 50.9 to 40.0, indicating a reduction in the company's core profitability.
2. Operating expenses increased by 6.1, from 27.0 to 33.1, which, when combined with the reduced gross profit, led to operating expenses as a percentage of gross profit rising from 53.0% to 82.8%.
3. Operating income from continuing operations saw a sharp decline of 17.0, from 23.9 to 6.9, reflecting the impact of increased expenses and reduced gross profit on operational efficiency.
4. Despite a slight increase in other income (expense), net by 1.5, from 0.1 to 1.6, the overall income from continuing operations before income taxes fell by 15.5, from 24.0 to 8.5, underscoring the challenges in maintaining profitability.
