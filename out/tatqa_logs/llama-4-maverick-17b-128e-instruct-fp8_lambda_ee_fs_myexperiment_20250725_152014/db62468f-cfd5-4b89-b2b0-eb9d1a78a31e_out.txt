                       'that the largest source of operating cash flows is '
                       'from customer payments for license support agreements. '
                       'The primary uses of cash from operating activities '
                       'include employee-related expenditures, material and '
                       'manufacturing costs, taxes, interest payments, and '
                       'leased facilities. The text also highlights that net '
                       'cash provided by operating activities decreased in '
                       '2019 compared to 2018 due to unfavorable changes in '
                       'working capital balances, mainly associated with '
                       'income taxes. Additionally, it explains that changes '
                       'in cash flows from investing activities are primarily '
                       'related to acquisitions, purchases, maturities, and '
                       'sales of investments. The net cash provided by '
                       'investing activities increased significantly in 2019 '
                       'due to increased sales and maturities of marketable '
                       'securities. For financing activities, the text notes '
                       'that net cash used increased in 2019 primarily due to '
