                       'recognition policy, and the impact on financial '
                       'statements. Key points include:\n'
                       '1. The company adopted ASC 606 effective January 1, '
                       '2018, using the modified retrospective method.\n'
                       '2. The company follows a five-step approach for '
                       'revenue recognition: identifying contracts, '
                       'performance obligations, determining transaction '
                       'price, allocating it to performance obligations, and '
                       'recognizing revenue upon satisfaction of performance '
                       'obligations.\n'
                       '3. Revenue is recognized when control transfers to '
                       'customers, typically upon shipment or delivery.\n'
                       '4. Sales taxes collected on behalf of customers are '
                       'excluded from revenue.\n'
                       '5. The company provides information on accounts '
                       'receivable and deferred revenue, including opening and '
                       'closing balances.\n'
                       '6. Deferred revenue is classified as current or '
                       'non-current based on the expected timing of revenue '
                       'recognition.\n'
                       '7. The company had no contracts with unsatisfied '
                       'performance obligations with a duration of more than '
                       'one year as of December 31, 2019.\n'
