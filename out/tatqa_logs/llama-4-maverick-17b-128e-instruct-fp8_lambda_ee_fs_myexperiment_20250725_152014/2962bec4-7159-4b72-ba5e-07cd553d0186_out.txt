                       'consolidated net revenues for 2019 was primarily '
                       'driven by lower revenues from certain franchises such '
                       'as Destiny, Hearthstone, Call of Duty, and Overwatch. '
                       'This decrease was partially offset by revenues from '
                       'new releases like Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and Crash '
