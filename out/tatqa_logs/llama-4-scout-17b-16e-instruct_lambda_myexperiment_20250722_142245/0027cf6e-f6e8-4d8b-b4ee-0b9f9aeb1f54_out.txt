                       'The company acquired MGI Grain Processing, LLC on '
                       'April 4, 2019, for an aggregate purchase price of $3.8 '
                       'million. The acquisition was accounted for as a '
                       "business combination, and the results of MGI's "
                       'operations are included in the consolidated financial '
                       'statements beginning April 4, 2019. The purchase price '
                       'included $0.3 million deposited in an escrow account '
                       'at closing, which was subsequently released to the '
                       'sellers in June 2019. The seller of MGI paid a working '
                       'capital adjustment of $18 thousand in 2019. The fair '
                       "value of MGI's trade receivables at acquisition "
                       'equaled the gross amount of trade receivables. The '
                       'fair value of the customer relationship intangible at '
                       'acquisition was estimated using an income approach '
                       'based on expected future cash flows. Goodwill '
                       'primarily was attributed to intangible assets that do '
                       'not qualify for separate recognition and synergies '
                       'generated by MGI when combined with the existing '
                       'operations. The $0.7 million allocated to goodwill is '
