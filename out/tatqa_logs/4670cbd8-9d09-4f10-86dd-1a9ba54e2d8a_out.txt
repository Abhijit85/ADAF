=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The data provides a detailed breakdown of the revenue changes between 2018 and 2019, highlighting significant increases in both product and service revenues. 

1. The product revenue saw a substantial increase of $2296 between 2018 and 2019, which represents an 8% growth from the previous year. This growth contributed to the product revenue making up 75.1% of the total revenue in 2019.
2. The service revenue also experienced growth, albeit at a slower pace. Between 2017 and 2018, the service revenue increased by $321, and it continued to grow by 3% in the following year.
3. The total revenue, which includes both product and service revenues, increased by 7% from the previous year. This is slightly higher than the 5% change in total revenue between 2018 and 2019.
4. It's important to note that these calculations exclude the SPVSS business, indicating that the increases are solely due to the performance of other sectors within the company.
