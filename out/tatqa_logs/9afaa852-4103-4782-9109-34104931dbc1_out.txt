=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The fiscal year ending August 31, 2019, reveals significant shifts in tax-related financial metrics, impacting the company's deferred tax assets and liabilities.

1. **Net Operating Loss and Deferred Tax Assets**: The net operating loss carry forward increased by $64038, from $119259 to $183297, contributing to a rise in total deferred tax assets before valuation allowances by $43904, from $445785 to $489689.

2. **Valuation Allowances and Net Deferred Tax Assets**: Valuation allowances saw a substantial increase of $64117, from $223487 to $287604, which, along with other factors, led to a 9.1% decrease in net deferred tax assets, down $20213 from $222298 to $202085.

3. **Property, Plant, and Equipment**: There was a notable decrease in property, plant, and equipment by $31152, from $97420 to $66268, marking a significant outlier compared to other financial categories.

4. **Foreign Tax Credits and Liabilities**: Foreign jurisdiction tax credits decreased by $10542, from $25887 to $15345, primarily due to their utilization against a one-time transition tax, while total deferred tax liabilities increased slightly by $645, from $118431 to $119076.
