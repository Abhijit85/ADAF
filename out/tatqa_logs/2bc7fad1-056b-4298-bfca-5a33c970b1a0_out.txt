=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The data provided highlights key financial aspects such as deferred income taxes, net deferred tax assets, and inventories for an unspecified company. 
1. Deferred income taxes, which arise from discrepancies in income and expense recognition for tax and financial reporting, were significant in the company's financials. 
2. The company had net deferred tax assets amounting to $2620 million in 2019, indicating a substantial amount of taxes to be paid in the future.
3. The deferred tax liabilities of the company were composed of intangible assets, property, plant, and equipment, and other unspecified components.
4. The company's inventories were valued at $58 million in 2018, suggesting a considerable amount of unsold goods or raw materials.
5. There was a decrease in deferred revenue from 2018 to 2019 by $1 million (5→4), representing a 20% reduction, which could indicate a decline in advance payments or unearned revenue.
