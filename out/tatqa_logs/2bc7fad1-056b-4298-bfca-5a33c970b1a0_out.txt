=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of deferred tax assets and liabilities reveals significant changes in financial reporting and tax recognition for the period in question.

1. **Tax Loss and Credit Carryforwards**: There was a substantial increase of $2804 million in tax loss and credit carryforwards, rising from $3237 million to $6041 million, indicating a strategic utilization of past losses to offset future taxable income.

2. **Valuation Allowance Ratio**: The valuation allowance as a percentage of gross deferred tax assets increased from 46.3% in 2018 to 64.6% in 2019, suggesting a more conservative approach in recognizing the realizability of deferred tax assets.

3. **Deferred Tax Liabilities**: A notable decrease of $499 million in deferred tax liabilities (from $603 million to $104 million) reflects a shift in the company's tax position, potentially due to changes in asset and liability recognition.

4. **Intangible Assets and Subsidiary Basis Differences**: The appearance of intangible assets as a deferred tax asset in 2019 ($964 million) and the absence of basis differences in subsidiaries, which were $946 million in 2018, highlight significant anomalies in asset recognition year-over-year.

- [OUTLIER] Interest as a deferred tax asset increased by $104 million (30→134), which is a substantial percentage increase.
- [RATIO] Valuation allowance as a percentage of gross deferred tax assets increased from 46.3% (2,191/4,731) in 2018 to 64.6% (4,970/7,694) in 2019.
- [TREND] Net deferred tax assets increased by $683 million (1,937→2,620).
- [ANOMALY] Basis difference in subsidiaries was $946 million in 2018 but is absent in 2019.

- [OUTLIER] Property, plant, and equipment deferred tax liability increased by $44 million (-13→-57), which is a notable change.
- [DEFINITION] "Deferred income taxes" result from "temporary differences" in asset and liability recognition.
- [SCOPE] The table components relate to the "net deferred income tax asset."
- [SOURCE] The context is derived from financial reporting and tax purposes.
