=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial performance shows significant growth in net revenues and operating income, though challenges remain in maintaining operating margins.

1. Net revenues saw a substantial increase of $616 million, rising from $1664 million to $2280 million, marking a 37% growth primarily driven by identity and information protection products.
2. The percentage of total net revenues increased from 41% to 47%, indicating a stronger contribution from the growing segments of the business.
3. Operating income rose by $272 million, from $839 million to $1111 million, a 32% increase, largely due to sales in identity and information protection.
4. Despite these gains, the operating margin slightly decreased from 50% to 49%, highlighting that higher costs of sales and operating expenses are impacting profitability.
