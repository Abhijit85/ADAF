=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In 2019, the company experienced significant changes in its share structure, marked by reductions in outstanding and dividend shares, alongside notable shifts in forfeited and released shares.

1. Outstanding shares decreased significantly from 776045 in 2018 to 690791 in 2019, reflecting a reduction of 85254 shares, which indicates a strategic move to consolidate shareholding.
2. Dividend shares awarded also saw a decrease from 9778 in 2018 to 4518 in 2019, a reduction of 5260 shares, suggesting a possible reevaluation of shareholder reward strategies.
3. A drastic reduction in forfeited shares from (75986) in 2018 to (9275) in 2019, a decrease of 66711 shares, highlights a potential improvement in employee retention or changes in share forfeiture policies.
4. Released shares increased significantly from (19046) in 2018 to (365162) in 2019, an increase of 346116 shares, with the 2019 figure being an outlier, possibly due to a large number of "good leavers" as per scheme rules.
