=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's financial records show a significant decrease in both dividend shares awarded and the amount outstanding at the end of March from 2018 to 2019. 

1. The number of dividend shares awarded dropped by 5260, from 9778 in 2018 to 4518 in 2019. This represents a substantial reduction in the company's dividend distribution.
2. The amount outstanding at the end of March also saw a significant decrease of 369919, from 690791 in 2018 to 320872 in 2019. This suggests a considerable reduction in the company's liabilities or obligations.
3. The percentage change in the amount outstanding at the end of March in 2019 from 2018 is approximately -53.6%. This indicates a more than half reduction in the company's outstanding amount within a year.
4. It's important to note that the SIP shares outstanding at 31 March 2018 have fully vested, and shares released prior to the vesting date are attributable to "good leavers as defined by the scheme rules". This could have contributed to the decrease in the outstanding amount and dividend shares awarded.
