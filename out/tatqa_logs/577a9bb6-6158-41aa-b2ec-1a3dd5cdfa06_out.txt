=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's financial performance has shown a positive trend in net income and non-cash charges from 2017 to 2019, despite a slight decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2019. 

1. The net income has consistently increased over the three fiscal years, with a significant jump of $3791 from 2018 to 2019, reaching its highest at $24193 in 2019. This indicates a growth in the company's total earnings.
2. Non-cash charges, which are expenses not involving cash outflows, have also seen a steady rise from $28725 in 2017 to $47625 in 2019. This could suggest an increase in depreciation, amortization, or other non-cash expenses.
3. Despite the increase in net income and non-cash charges, the cash provided by operating activities, which represents the cash generated from the company's core business operations, slightly decreased from $45082 in 2018 to $45007 in 2019. This slight decrease could be due to changes in working capital or other operating cash flows.
4. The average net income from 2017 to 2019 was $19654, indicating a generally positive financial performance over these years. However, the context does not provide any financial details for fiscal year 2017, which limits a comprehensive understanding of the company's financial trajectory.
