=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's financial performance in 2018 and 2019 showed a stable trend in net operating loss carry-forwards, a decrease in tax credits, and an increase in equity-based compensation. 
1. The net operating loss carry-forwards remained almost constant at $255235 in 2018 and $255269 in 2019, with the total for both years being $510504. This indicates that the company has been consistently incurring losses that it can use to offset future profits for tax purposes.
2. There was a slight decrease in tax credits from $2458 in 2018 to $2261 in 2019, with an average of $2359.5 over the two years. This could suggest a reduction in the company's tax liabilities or a decrease in qualifying activities.
3. Equity-based compensation increased by 23.9% from $3322 in 2018 to $4116 in 2019, indicating a greater use of equity as a form of employee remuneration.
4. The company's total net operating loss carry-forwards for 2019 was significantly higher at $994.0 million, with the US and international operations contributing $97.6 million and $896.2 million respectively. This suggests a substantial increase in losses that can be carried forward to future years.
