=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals significant changes in the company's tax and liability positions from 2018 to 2019, highlighting areas of potential concern and opportunity.

1. **Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities**: Total gross deferred tax assets increased by $32920 (from $261015 to $293935), while the net deferred tax position shifted from a positive $2733 in 2018 to a negative $(9399) in 2019, indicating a potential future tax burden.

2. **Valuation Allowance and Tax Credits**: The valuation allowance rose by $4490 (from $126579 to $131069), suggesting increased uncertainty in realizing deferred tax assets. Concurrently, tax credits decreased by $197 (from $2458 to $2261), potentially impacting future tax savings.

3. **Operating Leases and Right-of-Use Assets**: Operating leases, which were absent in 2018, appeared in 2019 with a value of $32289, and right-of-use assets liabilities were recorded at $29670, reflecting changes in accounting standards or lease agreements.

4. **Net Operating Loss Carryforwards**: The company holds $994.0 million in net operating loss carryforwards, with $896.4 million outside the U.S. not subject to Section 382 limitations, providing a significant opportunity to offset future taxable income.
