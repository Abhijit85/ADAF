=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's financial reports reveal a decrease in both in-game and consolidated net revenues from 2018 to 2019. 

1. In 2019, the in-game net revenues were $3376, a decrease from the $4249 reported in 2018. This revenue includes the net amount recognized for downloadable content and microtransactions during the period.
2. The consolidated net revenues also saw a decrease in 2019, amounting to $6489 compared to $7500 in 2018. The total consolidated net revenue for both years was $13989.
3. The sum of consolidated net revenues and in-game net revenues was $9865 in 2019, a decrease from $11749 in 2018.
4. The decrease in consolidated net revenues in 2019 was primarily due to lower revenues from the Destiny franchise, Hearthstone, Call of Duty franchise catalog titles, and Overwatch. However, this decrease was partially offset by revenues from Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled.
