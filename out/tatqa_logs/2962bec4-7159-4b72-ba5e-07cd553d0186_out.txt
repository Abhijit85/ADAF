=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis highlights a significant decline in consolidated net revenues from 2018 to 2019, driven by various factors affecting key gaming titles.

1. Consolidated net revenues fell by $1011 million, a (13)% decrease from $7500 million to $6489 million, indicating a substantial downturn in overall financial performance.
   
2. In-game net revenues, which include "downloadable content and microtransactions," saw a sharper decline of $873 million, a (21)% drop from $4249 million to $3376 million, reducing their share of total revenues from 57% in 2018 to 52% in 2019.

3. The sale of Destiny's publishing rights to Bungie significantly impacted revenue recognition, contributing to a $1.1 billion decrease in revenues from major titles like Destiny, Hearthstone, Call of Duty, and Overwatch.

4. Despite the overall decline, there was a $236 million increase in revenues from new titles such as Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled, partially offsetting losses from other franchises.
