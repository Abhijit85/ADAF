=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of financial trends from 2017 to 2019 reveals shifts in key metrics affecting option valuation. 

1. **Dividend Yield Trends**: The dividend yield showed a slight increase from 4.1% in 2017 to 4.6% in 2018, followed by a marginal decrease to 4.5% in 2019, indicating fluctuations in expected annual dividends relative to stock price.

2. **Volatility Changes**: Expected volatility rose from 27.1% in 2017 to 28.7% in 2018, before slightly decreasing to 28.3% in 2019, reflecting changes in historical volatility over the period.

3. **Interest Rate Stability**: The risk-free interest rate increased from 2.0% in 2017 to 2.5% in 2018 and remained constant through 2019, providing a stable benchmark for option pricing.

4. **Option Term Adjustment**: The expected life of the option term decreased from 4.5 years in 2017 to 4.3 years in 2019, suggesting a trend towards shorter option durations based on historical exercise patterns.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Dividend yield decreased over time: 4.6% (2018) → 4.5% (2019).
- [TREND] Expected volatility decreased from 28.7% (2018) to 28.3% (2019).
- [TREND] Risk-free interest rate remained constant at 2.5% from 2018 to 2019.
- [TREND] Expected life of the option term decreased from 4.5 years (2017) to 4.3 years (2019).
- [TREND] Dividend yield increased from 4.1% (2017) to 4.6% (2018).
- [TREND] Expected volatility increased from 27.1% (2017) to 28.7% (2018).
- [TREND] Risk-free interest rate increased from 2.0% (2017) to 2.5% (2018).
- [DEFINITION] "Expected Dividend Yield" is based on "expected annual dividends and the Company’s stock price."
- [DEFINITION] "Expected Volatility" uses "historical volatility for a period commensurate with the expected term."
- [DEFINITION] "Risk-Free Interest Rate" is the "zero coupon US Treasury rate" matching the option's expected term.
- [DEFINITION] "Expected Term of the Option" is estimated by "analyzing historical stock option exercises."
- [DEFINITION] "Forfeiture Rates" are estimated "based on historical data" and employee class considerations.
- [SCOPE] Fair value of options: $8.92 (2019), $8.45 (2018), $7.06 (2017).
- [SCOPE] Assumptions apply to options granted in "three years ended December 31, 2019."
