                       '1. **Consistency Validation**: All answers from '
                       'TabuSynth and Contextron agents are fully aligned for '
                       'all questions.\n'
                       '2. **Answer Formatting**:\n'
                       '   - **Q1 (Description)**: Text answer with `scale=""` '
                       '(no numerical unit)\n'
                       '   - **Q2-Q3 (Percentages)**: Exact values with '
                       '`scale="percent"`\n'
                       '   - **Q4-Q6 (Changes)**: Numerical differences '
                       'treated as absolute values (not ratios), hence '
                       '`scale=""` (percentage points aren\'t a defined scale '
                       'in TATQA)\n'
                       "3. **Prioritization**: Contextron's answers are used "
                       'as primary source since they incorporate both table '
                       'and text context (per task guidelines), though '

                       '   - Negative signs preserved for decreases\n'
                       '   - Units stripped from numerical values (e.g., '
                       '"50.9" not "50.9%")\n'
                       '   - Text answer condensed to factual core from both '
                       'agents\n'
                       '5. **Visura Handling**: No image-derived input '
