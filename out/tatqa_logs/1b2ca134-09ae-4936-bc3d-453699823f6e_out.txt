=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Goodwill experienced a notable increase from 2018 to 2019, driven primarily by acquisitions and affected by currency fluctuations.

1. Goodwill rose significantly by $830.6 million, from $1620.2 million in 2018 to $2450.8 million in 2019, highlighting substantial growth in the company's acquisition activities.
2. Additions from acquisitions amounted to $866.9 million in 2019, with no comparable figure in 2018, indicating a strategic expansion through acquisitions during this period.
3. The effect of foreign currency translation and other adjustments was a negative $36.3 million in 2019, contrasting with a positive $59.1 million in 2018, suggesting a reversal in currency impact.
4. Accumulated impairment losses remained constant at $149.2 million for both years, reflecting no new impairments and consistent valuation of acquired goodwill.
