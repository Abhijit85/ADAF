=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's cash flow statements from 2017 to 2019 show a consistent increase in net cash provided by operating activities, fluctuating net cash provided by or used in investing activities, and a high average net cash used in financing activities. 
1. The net cash provided by operating activities increased by $224 million in 2019, up from an increase of $242 million in 2018, primarily due to favorable working capital changes and lower integration and restructuring costs.
2. The net cash provided by (used in) investing activities varied over the years, with $65 million provided in 2020, $114 million used in 2018, and $71 million used in 2017. The change from 2017 to 2018 was an increase in cash used of $43 million, mainly due to the acquisition of IS&GS Business.
3. The average net cash used in financing activities between 2017 and 2019 was approximately $615 million, with an increase of $2 million in 2019 mainly due to the timing of debt payments and higher stock repurchases, and an increase of $278 million in 2018 primarily due to stock repurchases and a tax indemnification liability.
4. An anomaly was observed in 2017 when the net cash provided by operating activities was less than $800 million, specifically $526 million.
