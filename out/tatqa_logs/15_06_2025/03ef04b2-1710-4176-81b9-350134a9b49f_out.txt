=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The fair value of derivative liabilities, including cross currency swaps, non-current liabilities, forward foreign exchange contracts, and interest rate swaps, experienced significant changes from 2018 to 2019. 
1. The fair value of cross currency swaps in 2018 was recorded at 1429, while the fair value of derivatives non-current liability in 2019 significantly increased to 41837.
2. The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts was higher in 2018, recorded at 1467.
3. The change in fair value of interest rate swaps from 2018 to 2019 saw a substantial increase of 40695, from 9196 to 49891.
4. The total fair value of the derivative liabilities increased by approximately 312.5% from 2018 to 2019, from 12092 to 49932.
5. Despite these changes, as of the end of 2018 and 2019, no interest rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedging instruments for accounting purposes. The Group uses these swaps to hedge against market interest rate fluctuations, with the bank counterparty making quarterly floating-rate payments based on the U.S. dollar LIBOR, and the Group making quarterly payments at the respective fixed rates.
