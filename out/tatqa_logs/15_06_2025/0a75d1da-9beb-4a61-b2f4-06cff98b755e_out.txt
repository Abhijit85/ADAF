=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The acquisition of Automated Packaging Systems, LLC in 2019 resulted in significant financial changes for the acquiring company. 
1. The company assumed liabilities of $100.1 million from the acquisition, which increased its total liabilities by approximately 5.5% compared to the pre-acquisition figure. 
2. The total equity of the acquisition was $445.7 million, calculated by subtracting the assumed liabilities from the total assets. 
3. The liability to asset ratio post-acquisition was approximately 0.18, indicating a relatively low level of debt compared to the company's assets. 
4. The acquisition was primarily funded through an incremental term facility under the company's Credit Agreement, with $58.2 million of the assumed liabilities related to a deferred incentive compensation plan for Automated's European employees. 
5. As of December 31, 2019, $19.7 million of the assumed liabilities had been paid, with the remaining payments to be made over the next two years. The allocation of the purchase price among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is still being finalized.
