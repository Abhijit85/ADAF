=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The data provides insights into the changes in the value of a company's physical assets, specifically land, buildings, leasehold improvements, and transportation equipment, between 2018 and 2019. 

1. The value of land in 2019 was reported to be $1949 thousand, although the data for the previous year is not provided for comparison.
2. The value of buildings and leasehold improvements in 2018 was significantly higher at $129582 thousand, but again, the data for 2019 is not provided.
3. The value of transportation equipment decreased by $23 thousand from 2018 to 2019, representing a percentage change of approximately -3.6%. This suggests a depreciation or disposal of transportation assets during this period.
4. The net value of property and equipment was calculated for both 2018 and 2019, but the specific amounts are not provided. This net value would include all the physical or fixed assets of the company. 

Without the complete data, it's impossible to provide a comprehensive analysis of the changes in the company's asset values over this period.

Answer Echoes:
- [ANOMALY] The amount for Land in 2019 was $1,949
- [ANOMALY] The amount for Buildings and leasehold improvements in 2018 was $129,582
- [ANOMALY] The amount of property and equipment, net was calculated for the years 2019 and 2018
- [ANOMALY] The amount of Transportation equipment was larger in 2018
- [TREND] The change in Transportation equipment in 2019 from 2018 was a decrease of $23 (636→613)
- [RATIO] The percentage change in Transportation equipment in 2019 from 2018 was approximately -3.6% ((636-613)/636*100)
