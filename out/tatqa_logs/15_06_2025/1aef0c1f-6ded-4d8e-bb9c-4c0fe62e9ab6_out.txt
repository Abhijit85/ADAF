=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The data provides an overview of the cost of revenue, research and development expenses, and share-based compensation expenses for a company over the fiscal years 2017 to 2019. 

1. The cost of revenue showed a decreasing trend over the years, with $3189 in 2017, $3869 in 2018, and $2936 in 2019. The average cost of revenue for these years was $3331.33.
2. The research and development cost in 2019 was less than 10000 thousands, indicating a possible focus on cost efficiency or a shift in business strategy.
3. The Selling, general and administrative expense increased by $2315 from 2018 to 2019, suggesting an increase in operational costs or investment in these areas.
4. The share-based compensation expense for 2017 was "$0.8 million", and the total unrecognized compensation costs as of September 27, 2019, were "$47.0 million". These costs are expected to be recognized over a "weighted-average period of 2.9 years", indicating a significant future financial commitment for the company.
