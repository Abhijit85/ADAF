=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The cash flow details for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 reveal significant changes in operating and financing activities, with some data points missing. 
1. The company experienced a negative balance in operating activities in 2019, primarily due to a net loss of $3.8 million. However, the specific factors contributing to this negative balance are not detailed in the table.
2. The cash provided from financing activities in 2018 was $1779, but the data for 2019 is not provided, making it impossible to calculate the percentage increase between these two years.
3. There is a notable absence of information about investing activities for both 2018 and 2019, indicating that there were no such activities during these years.
4. The difference in cash used in operating activities between 2018 and 2019 is $3290, and the increase in cash and cash equivalents during this period is $2900. However, the context does not provide the exact increase in cash and cash equivalents from 2018 to 2019.
