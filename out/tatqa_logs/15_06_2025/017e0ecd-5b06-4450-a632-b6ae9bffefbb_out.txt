Answer Echoes:
- The general and administrative labour had "1,620 employees at June 30, 2019".
- The general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, was "approximately 7%".
- General and administrative expenses primarily consist of "payroll and payroll related benefits expenses, related overhead, audit fees, other professional fees, contract labour and consulting expenses and public company costs".
- The Total change in general and administrative expenses from Fiscal year 2017 to 2019 is calculated by adding the changes from 2017 to 2018 and from 2018 to 2019, which is "$34,874 in thousands" and "$2,682 in thousands" respectively, totaling to "$37,556 in thousands".
- The average annual Total change in general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2017 to 2019 is calculated by dividing the total change by the number of years, which is "$37,556 in thousands" divided by 2, resulting in "$18,778 in thousands".
- The difference in the increase of Travel and communication expense in fiscal years 2019 and 2018 as compared to 2018 and 2017 is calculated by subtracting the change from 2018 to 2017 from the change from 2019 to 2018, which is "$794 in thousands" minus "$80 in thousands", resulting in "$714 in thousands".
