=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The energy and water consumption data for the year ended 31 December 2019 shows an increase in both direct and indirect energy consumption, as well as running water consumption, compared to the previous year. 

1. The total energy consumption for 2019 was 205092.26 MWh, a significant increase from 167488.48 MWh in 2018. This total is calculated from purchased electricity and fuel data.
2. Direct energy consumption also saw an increase, from 12852.04 MWh in 2018 to 19144.17 MWh in 2019, a change of Δ6292.13. The definition of direct energy consumption is not explicitly defined in the context.
3. Indirect energy consumption rose by Δ31311.65, from 154636.44 MWh in 2018 to 185948.09 MWh in 2019.
4. Running water consumption, which only includes data centres wholly used by the Group, increased by Δ310336.67 tonnes, from 973413.06 tonnes in 2018 to 1283749.73 tonnes in 2019.
5. The scope of resource use data now includes 12 new office buildings operational in 2019, which could be a contributing factor to the increases observed.
