=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial data for 2019 shows a significant increase in amounts owed by subsidiaries falling due within one year, and a substantial average total amount falling due within the same period. 
1. The financial items that make up the amounts falling due within one year include amounts owed by subsidiaries, taxation recoverable, other debtors, and derivative financial instruments. 
2. In 2019, the taxation recoverable falling due within one year was €233m, while the average total amount falling due within one year was significantly higher at €243424m.
3. The amounts owed by subsidiaries falling due within one year increased from €220871m in 2018 to €242976m in 2019, indicating a growing financial obligation within the group.
4. The average total amount falling due after more than one year was considerably lower at €3439m, consisting of derivative financial instruments and deferred tax. 
5. It's important to note that amounts owed by subsidiaries are unsecured, have no fixed date of repayment, and are repayable on demand, which could potentially impact the group's liquidity, although expected credit losses are considered immaterial due to sufficient liquidity in the group.
