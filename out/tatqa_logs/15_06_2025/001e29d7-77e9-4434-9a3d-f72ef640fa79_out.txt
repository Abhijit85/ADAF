=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The UK and Ireland are the regions with the highest exposure to credit risk for trade receivables, with a notable decrease in risk for Ireland in 2018. 

1. The UK and Ireland were identified as the geographic regions with the maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date. However, the specific amounts for these regions were not provided.
2. In 2018, the credit risk exposure for Ireland was significantly higher at £0.5m. This amount decreased by £0.1m or 20% in the following year, indicating a reduction in credit risk.
3. The maximum exposure to credit risk overall increased from £56.5m in 2018 to £59.1m in 2019. This suggests that while risk decreased in Ireland, it may have increased in other regions.
4. The "Carrying amount of financial assets" was reclassified from "loans and receivables" under IAS 39 to "amortised cost" under IFRS 9, which may have implications for how credit risk is calculated and reported.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] The geographic regions involving the maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date are the UK and Ireland.
- [OUTLIER] The amount for Ireland was larger in 2018 (£0.5m).
- [ANOMALY] The change in the amount for Ireland was a decrease of £0.1m (0.5→0.4).
- [RATIO] The percentage change in the amount for Ireland was a decrease of 20% ((0.5-0.4)/0.5*100).
