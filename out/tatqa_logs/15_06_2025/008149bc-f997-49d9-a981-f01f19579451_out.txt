=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's tax accounting for fiscal years 2017 to 2019 shows significant changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities, influenced by U.S. federal corporate income tax rate changes and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). 

1. The valuation allowance saw an increase of $14 million in fiscal 2019, rising from $109 million to $123 million, due to changes in deferred tax assets.
2. The company's reserves and accruals in 2019 amounted to $50 million, while the net operating loss and credit carryforwards in 2018 were $131 million.
3. There was an increase in 'Other' deferred tax liabilities by $4 million, from $14 million in 2018 to $10 million in 2019.
4. Gross deferred tax assets exceeded $400 million only in 2019, marking a significant outlier in the company's tax accounting.
5. Total deferred tax liabilities increased by 16.85% between 2018 and 2019, from $89 million to $104 million.
6. The company recorded significant tax expenses in fiscal 2018 and 2019 due to tax rate changes and the TCJA, including a $108 million tax expense in 2018, a $732 million discrete tax expense in 2018 for the estimated U.S. federal and state income tax impacts of the transition tax, and a $22 million tax expense in 2019 due to the global minimum tax on intangible income (GMT) provisions of the TCJA.
