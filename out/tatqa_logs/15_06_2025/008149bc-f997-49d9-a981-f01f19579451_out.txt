=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial year 2019 saw an increase in valuation allowance and total deferred tax liabilities, a decrease in 'Other' deferred tax liabilities, and gross deferred tax assets exceeding $400 million.

2. The reserves and accruals for the year 2019 were recorded at "$50".
3. The Net operating loss and credit carryforwards for the year 2018 were "$131".
4. The 'Other' deferred tax liabilities saw a decrease from "$14 in 2018 to $10 in 2019".
