=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The notes provide insights into the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets from 2017 to 2019, along with the methodology used to determine these rates. 

1. The discount rate for 2019 was 2.5%, and the average discount rate over the three-year period from 2017 to 2019 was 2.7%. These rates are crucial in determining the costs for the plans.
2. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets decreased by 1.0% from 4.3% in 2017 to 3.3% in 2019. This rate is based on interest rates guaranteed under insurance contracts and considers the expected rate of return for each asset category, weighted for distribution within a diversified investment fund.
3. The "weighted average actuarial assumptions" and "weighted-average expected long-term rate of return" are used to determine these rates. Factors such as "asset class allocations," "long-term rates of return" (actual and expected), and results of periodic asset liability modeling studies are considered when constructing the long-term rate of return assumption.
4. The assumptions are based on customary rates and practices for the location of the plans, indicating a localized approach to financial planning. However, the notes do not provide specific information about changes in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets from 2017 to 2019 or the average discount rate over this period.
