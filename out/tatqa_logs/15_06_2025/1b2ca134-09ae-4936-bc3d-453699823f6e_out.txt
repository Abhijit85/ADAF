=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Autodesk's goodwill saw a significant increase from 2018 to 2019, with no impairment losses recognized in either year. 
1. Autodesk's goodwill at the end of 2018 was $1620.2 million, which increased by $830.6 million to $2450.8 million by the end of 2019. This represents a substantial growth in the company's goodwill over the period.
2. The total ending goodwill for the years 2018 and 2019 was $4071.0 million, indicating a strong accumulation of goodwill over the two-year period.
3. The average ending goodwill for the 2 year period from 2018 to 2019 was $2035.5 million, reflecting a consistent growth in the company's goodwill.
4. Despite the significant increase in goodwill, Autodesk did not recognize any goodwill impairment losses in fiscal 2018 or 2017, and there was no goodwill impairment during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019. This suggests that the company's acquisitions have been successful and have added value to the business.
