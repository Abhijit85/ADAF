=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's financial obligations and commitments as of May 26, 2019, reveal that 'Long-term debt' is the most significant contractual obligation, with unfunded pension and postretirement benefit obligations also being notable. 

1. The company's highest contractual obligation is 'Long-term debt', which totals $10556.6 million. This figure is an outlier in the company's financial commitments.
2. Almost half (47.6%) of the long-term debt payments are due within the next five years, indicating a significant financial commitment in the near term.
3. The ratio of total notes payable to total capital lease obligations is relatively low at 0.60%, suggesting that the company's capital lease obligations significantly outweigh its notes payable.
4. The company has unfunded pension and postretirement benefit obligations, which are not included in the table as they are remeasured each fiscal year. The company plans to fund these at approximately $14.2 million and $10.8 million, respectively, over the next twelve months.
5. The company has a guarantee arrangement with a business entity named 'Lamb Weston', but the context does not provide further details about this arrangement.
