=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Net financing costs saw a significant increase of €1266m, primarily due to mark-to-market losses and adverse foreign exchange rate movements. 
1. The net financing costs rose from €389m to €1655m, marking an increase of €1266m. This increase is primarily attributed to mark-to-market losses and adverse foreign exchange rate movements.
2. The investment income for 2019 was €433m, which is lower than the average investment income of €559m between 2018 and 2019.
3. The financing costs for 2019 were €2088m, significantly higher than the average financing costs of €1581m between 2018 and 2019.
4. The difference between the average investment income and average financing costs was €1022m, indicating a higher cost of financing compared to the returns from investments.
5. Despite the increase in net financing costs, the underlying financing costs remained stable when excluding the factors of mark-to-market losses and adverse foreign exchange rate movements.
