=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company experienced a significant decrease in both dividend shares awarded and shares outstanding at the end of March from 2018 to 2019. 
1. The number of dividend shares awarded to employees dropped by 5260 shares, from 9778 in 2018 to 4518 in 2019. This represents a significant reduction in the company's share incentive plan (SIP) awards.
2. The number of shares outstanding at the end of March also saw a substantial decrease, falling by 369919 shares from 690791 in 2018 to 320872 in 2019. 
3. This decrease in shares outstanding represents a 53.56% reduction, indicating a significant contraction in the company's equity base.
4. It's important to note that all SIP shares outstanding at the end of March 2018 had fully vested, and any shares released prior to the vesting date were attributable to "good leavers", employees who left the company under circumstances that did not disqualify them from receiving certain benefits.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] The number of dividend shares awarded decreased from 9,778 in 2018 to 4,518 in 2019, a decrease of 5,260 shares.
- [TREND] The number of shares outstanding at 31 March decreased from 690,791 in 2018 to 320,872 in 2019, a decrease of 369,919 shares.
- [RATIO] The percentage change in the number of shares outstanding at 31 March from 2018 to 2019 is calculated as (369,919 / 690,791) * 100 = 53.56% decrease.
