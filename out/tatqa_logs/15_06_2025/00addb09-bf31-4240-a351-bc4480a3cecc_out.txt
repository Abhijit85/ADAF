=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial performance of the companies in fiscal year F19 shows a mixed picture with an increase in sales but a decrease in Return on Funds Employed (ROFE). 
1. Sales for the companies increased by 5.0% between F19 and F18, reaching a total of $8.7 billion. This indicates a positive growth trend in revenue generation.
2. Despite the increase in sales, the companies experienced a decline in profitability as indicated by the nominal difference for ROFE between F19 and F18, which was -1.9% (17.1%→15.2%). This suggests that the companies were less efficient in using their funds to generate profit in F19 compared to F18.
3. The gross margin for F19 was 22.9%, showing the percentage of total sales revenue that the companies retained after incurring the direct costs associated with producing the goods and services sold.
4. The average value for sales per square metre for both F19 and F18 was $18384.5, suggesting a consistent performance in terms of sales productivity. However, the number of stores under Dan Murphy's store network in F19 was not provided, limiting the analysis of store performance.
