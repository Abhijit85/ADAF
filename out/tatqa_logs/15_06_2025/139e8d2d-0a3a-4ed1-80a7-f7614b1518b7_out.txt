=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The data provides an analysis of depreciation expense and property, plant, and equipment net values for the years 2017 to 2019. 

1. The depreciation expense increased each year, with $442 million in 2017, $487 million in 2018, and $510 million in 2019, indicating a consistent rise in the cost allocated to tangible assets over their useful life.
2. The Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net was calculated for 2019 and 2018, with a larger amount in 2019 at $3574 million, compared to $3497 million in 2018. This suggests an increase in the net value of these assets.
3. The change in Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net from 2018 to 2019 was $77 million, representing a growth of approximately 2.2%.
4. The components under Property, plant, and equipment, gross, such as land and improvements, buildings and improvements, machinery and equipment, and construction in process, were not specified in the context.
5. An anomaly was noted in the depreciation expense in 2019, which was only $5, significantly lower than the actual expense of $510 million. This discrepancy needs further investigation.
