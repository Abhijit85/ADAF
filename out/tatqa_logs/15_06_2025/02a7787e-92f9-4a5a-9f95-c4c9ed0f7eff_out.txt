=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The table provides a breakdown of the aggregate emoluments of the Company's Directors and members of the Executive Committee for the financial years ending in 2017, 2018, and 2019, excluding gains from long-term incentive plans but including the value of cash allowances taken in lieu of pension contributions. 
1. The financial items listed are Salaries and fees, Incentive schemes, and Other benefits, with the 2019 salaries and fees amounting to 4 €m.
2. The average salaries and fees between 2018 and 2019 were also 4 €m, indicating a stable salary structure over the two years.
3. In contrast, the average incentive schemes between 2018 and 2019 were lower, at 2.5 €m, showing a 1.5 €m difference with the average salaries and fees.
4. It's important to note that no Directors exercised share options in the year ended 31 March 2019, which could have potentially affected the overall compensation figures. The data does not provide specific figures for "salaries and fees" or "incentive schemes", which limits a more detailed analysis.
