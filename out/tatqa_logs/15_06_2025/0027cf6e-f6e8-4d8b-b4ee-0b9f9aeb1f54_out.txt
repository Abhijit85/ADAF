                       'acquisition of MGI Grain Processing, LLC. \n'
                       '1. The cash amount remained unchanged at $3,795 during '
                       'this period, indicating a stable cash flow situation.\n'
                       '2. The working capital adjustment to the purchase '
                       'price decreased from $(38) to $(18), a significant '
                       'reduction of 52.63%, suggesting an improvement in the '
                       "company's working capital management.\n"
                       '3. The total fair value of consideration transferred '
                       'increased slightly by 0.53% from $3,757 to $3,777, '
                       "reflecting a minor increase in the company's "
                       'liabilities.\n'
                       '4. The acquisition of MGI Grain Processing, LLC, which '
                       'included a grain mill and processing facility, was '
                       'completed for a purchase price of $3.8 million, with '
                       '$0.3 million deposited in an escrow account. The '
                       'seller of MGI paid a working capital adjustment of $18 '
                       'thousand in 2019, and the company incurred $0.1 '
                       'million of MGI acquisition-related costs in the same '
                       'year. The fair value of MGI’s trade receivables at '
                       'acquisition equaled the gross amount of trade '
                       'receivables, and the fair value of the customer '
