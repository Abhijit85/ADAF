Answer Echoes:
- The respective dividend yield in 2017 and 2018 is 4.1% and 4.6%.
- The respective dividend yield in 2018 and 2019 is 4.6% and 4.5%.
- The respective expected volatility in 2017 and 2018 is 27.1% and 28.7%.
- The average dividend yield in 2017 and 2018 is (4.1% + 4.6%) / 2 = 4.35%.
- The average dividend yield in 2018 and 2019 is (4.6% + 4.5%) / 2 = 4.55%.
- The average expected volatility in 2017 and 2018 is (27.1% + 28.7%) / 2 = 27.9%.
