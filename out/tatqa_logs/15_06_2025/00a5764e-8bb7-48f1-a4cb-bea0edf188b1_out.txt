=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The data presents the dividend yield and expected volatility for the years 2017, 2018, and 2019, along with the average calculations for these metrics. 
1. The dividend yield increased from 4.1% in 2017 to 4.6% in 2018, but slightly decreased to 4.5% in 2019.
2. The expected volatility also increased from 27.1% in 2017 to 28.7% in 2018, with no data available for 2019.
3. The average dividend yield was calculated as (4.1% + 4.6%) / 2 for 2017 and 2018, and as (4.6% + 4.5%) / 2 for 2018 and 2019.
4. The average expected volatility for 2017 and 2018 was calculated as (27.1% + 28.7%) / 2.

Answer Echoes:
- The dividend yield in 2017 was "4.1%" and in 2018 it was "4.6%".
