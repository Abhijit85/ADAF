=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis of the company from 2015 to 2019 reveals significant growth and notable financial shifts.

1. **Consistent Growth in Sales and Book Value**: Net Sales increased from $881.1M in 2015 to $1000.3M in 2019, while Book Value per share rose from $11.82 to $18.43 over the same period, indicating strong financial health and shareholder value enhancement.

2. **Significant Tax and Income Changes**: The Income Tax Expense dropped dramatically from $66.6M in 2018 to $12.0M in 2019, largely due to a $53.7 million tax charge in 2018 from U.S. Tax Reform, which also contributed to the improvement in Net Income as a Percentage of Sales from 6.3% in 2018 to 9.2% in 2019.

3. **Debt and Asset Fluctuations**: Total Debt saw a substantial increase from $57.8M in 2018 to $292.6M in 2019, while Total Assets grew from $915.9M to $1231.7M, reflecting significant financial restructuring or investment activities.

4. **Return on Equity Decline**: Despite overall growth, Return on Average Equity decreased from 23.5% in 2015 to 13.9% in 2019, with a notable low of 9.8% in 2018, suggesting challenges in generating returns on shareholder equity.
