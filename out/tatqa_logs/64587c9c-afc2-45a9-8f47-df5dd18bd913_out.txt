=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The data provided shows a trend in depreciation amounts and changes in furniture and equipment values for the fiscal years 2018 and 2019. 

1. The depreciation amount increased by $4138 from $16050 in 2018 to $20188 in 2019. This indicates a higher rate of asset depreciation in 2019 compared to the previous year.
2. The value of furniture and equipment increased slightly by $933 from $10671 in 2018 to $11604 in 2019, suggesting a modest investment in these assets.
3. The average value of furniture and equipment for the two years was $11137.5, while the average for leasehold improvements was $6900. This shows a higher investment in furniture and equipment compared to leasehold improvements.
4. Despite the increase in depreciation, the depreciation expense decreased slightly from $2.6 million in 2018 to $2.5 million in 2019. Similarly, the amortization expense on capitalized internal-use software was $2.5 million in 2019. However, the context does not provide any information about the changes in these expenses over the years.
