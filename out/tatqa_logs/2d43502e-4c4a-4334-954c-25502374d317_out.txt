=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The Transportation Solutions segment experienced a significant decrease in operating income in fiscal 2019, largely due to increased acquisition and integration costs. 
1. The operating income for the segment decreased by $352 million in fiscal 2019, a substantial drop from the previous year.
2. This decrease was primarily attributed to lower volume, an unfavorable product mix, and price erosion, although it was partially offset by lower material costs.
3. Acquisition and integration costs, a contributing factor to the decrease in operating income, increased by $9 million from 2018 to 2019, a percentage change of 112.5%.
4. Despite the increase in these costs, the context does not provide specific information about the acquisition and integration costs for either year, making it difficult to fully understand their impact on the segment's operating income.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Acquisition and integration costs increased by $9 million from 2018 to 2019 (8→17)
- [RATIO] The percentage change in Acquisition and integration costs from 2018 to 2019 was 112.5% ((17-8)/8*100)
