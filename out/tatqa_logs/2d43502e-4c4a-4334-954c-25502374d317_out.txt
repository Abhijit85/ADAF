=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In fiscal 2019, the company experienced significant changes in its financial charges and operating income, driven by various internal and external factors.

1. Acquisition and integration costs saw a notable increase of $9 million, rising from $8 million to $17 million, indicating heightened activity in mergers and acquisitions.
   
2. Restructuring and other charges, net, surged by $111 million, from $33 million to $144 million, making up 82.3% of the total charges in 2019, compared to 73.3% in 2018, highlighting a strategic shift in operational restructuring.

3. An anomaly was observed as charges related to the amortization of acquisition-related fair value adjustments dropped to $0 from $4 million, suggesting a change in accounting or valuation practices.

4. The Transportation Solutions segment faced a $352 million decrease in operating income due to factors like lower volume, unfavorable product mix, and price erosion, partially offset by lower material costs.
