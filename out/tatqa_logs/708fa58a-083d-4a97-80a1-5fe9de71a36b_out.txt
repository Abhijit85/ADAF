=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The table presents a three-year trend in GreenSky, Inc.'s loan receivable sales and servicing activities, showing a significant increase in both loan sales and servicing fees from 2017 to 2019. 

1. In 2017, the sales of loans were reported at $72071 thousand, which marked the lowest figure in the given period.
2. There was a substantial increase in loan sales by $66955 thousand to reach $139026 thousand in 2018, indicating a strong growth in the company's loan selling operations.
3. The servicing fee in 2018 was relatively low at $2321 thousand, but it saw a significant rise by $1580 thousand to exceed $3000 thousand in 2019.
4. The increase in both loan sales and servicing fees over the years suggests an expansion in the company's operations related to selling and servicing loans. However, without the actual table, it's impossible to provide a more detailed analysis of the changes between years.
