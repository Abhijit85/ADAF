=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The fiscal analysis reveals notable changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities, highlighting shifts in valuation and asset components.

1. Gross deferred tax assets saw an increase of $31, moving from $395 to $426, indicating a growth in potential future tax benefits.
2. The valuation allowance rose by $14, from $(109) to $(123), primarily due to foreign and state tax credits, which suggests a cautious approach in recognizing deferred tax assets.
3. Despite the increase in gross deferred tax assets, the net deferred tax assets, after accounting for the valuation allowance, increased by only $17, from $286 to $303, reflecting a more conservative net gain.
4. The ratio of deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, to total deferred tax liabilities decreased slightly from 3.21 to 2.91, indicating a relative increase in liabilities compared to net assets.
5. A significant outlier was the $49 increase in deferred revenue, from $156 to $205, marking the largest change among deferred tax asset components and potentially impacting future revenue recognition.
