**Contextual Insights:**
- The reclassification of financial assets from loans and receivables to amortised cost reflects a shift in accounting standards from IAS 39 to IFRS 9, which may impact how financial assets are measured and reported.
- The maximum exposure to credit risk indicates the potential financial risk the entity faces as of 31 March 2019, which is a critical factor for stakeholders assessing the company's financial health.
- The lack of specific geographic regions for maximum credit risk exposure suggests a need for further detail in the reporting to better understand regional risk concentrations.
- The decrease in the amount for Ireland, both in absolute and percentage terms, could indicate a reduction in business activities or changes in market conditions in that region.
