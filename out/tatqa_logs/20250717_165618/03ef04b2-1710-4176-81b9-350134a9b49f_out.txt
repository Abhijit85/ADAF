=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Based on the provided context and source notes, here are the answers to the questions along with contextual insights:

1. **In which years was the fair value of the derivative liabilities recorded for?**
   - The fair value of the derivative liabilities was recorded for the years 2018 and 2019.

2. **What was the fair value of cross currency swaps in 2018?**
   - The fair value of cross currency swaps in 2018 is not explicitly provided in the context. Additional data from the table or paragraphs would be needed to answer this precisely.

3. **What was the fair value of derivatives non-current liability in 2019?**
   - The fair value of derivatives non-current liability in 2019 is not explicitly provided in the context. Additional data from the table or paragraphs would be needed to answer this precisely.

4. **In which year was the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts higher?**
   - The context does not provide explicit values for the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts for comparison. Additional data from the table or paragraphs would be needed to answer this precisely.

5. **What was the change in fair value of interest rate swaps from 2018 to 2019?**
   - As of December 31, 2018, and 2019, there are no interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedging instruments for accounting purposes. Therefore, there is no change in fair value recorded for interest rate swaps between these years.

6. **What was the percentage change in total fair value of the derivative liabilities from 2018 to 2019?**
   - The context does not provide explicit values for the total fair value of derivative liabilities for 2018 and 2019. Additional data from the table or paragraphs would be needed to calculate the percentage change.

**Contextual Insights:**
- The context indicates that there are no interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedging instruments for accounting purposes as of the end of 2018 and 2019, which implies that any changes in fair value for these instruments are not recorded for these years.
- The lack of specific values for certain derivatives in the context suggests that a detailed table or additional paragraphs are necessary to provide precise answers to some of the questions.

Answer Echoes:
- In which years was the fair value of the derivative liabilities recorded for?
- What was the fair value of cross currency swaps in 2018?
- What was the fair value of derivatives non-current liability in 2019?
- In which year was the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts higher?
- What was the change in fair value of interest rate swaps from 2018 to 2019?
- **Unable to answer solely from table, need to use context from Paragraphs**
