=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Based on the provided source notes and the task requirements, here are the answers to the questions along with contextual insights:

1. **What are the respective dividend yield in 2017 and 2018?**
   - The source notes indicate that this information is available, but the specific values are not provided in the notes. Additional context from the table or paragraphs is needed to provide precise values.

2. **What are the respective dividend yield in 2018 and 2019?**
   - Similar to the previous question, the source notes confirm that this information is available, but specific values are not provided. Additional context from the table or paragraphs is needed.

3. **What are the respective expected volatility in 2017 and 2018?**
   - The source notes confirm that this information is available, but specific values are not provided. Additional context from the table or paragraphs is needed.

4. **What is the average dividend yield in 2017 and 2018?**
   - The source notes explicitly state that this cannot be determined solely from the table and requires additional context from the paragraphs.

5. **What is the average dividend yield in 2018 and 2019?**
   - Similar to the previous question, the source notes indicate that this cannot be determined solely from the table and requires additional context from the paragraphs.

6. **What is the average expected volatility in 2017 and 2018?**
   - The source notes state that this cannot be determined solely from the table and requires additional context from the paragraphs.

**Contextual Insights:**
- The source notes suggest that while some data points are available, specific numerical values for dividend yields and expected volatility are not directly provided in the notes. This indicates a need for additional context or data from the original table or paragraphs to answer these questions accurately.
- The inability to determine averages from the table alone highlights the importance of integrating multiple data sources for comprehensive analysis.
- The repeated mention of needing additional context suggests that the original data source may contain detailed information that was not fully captured in the notes provided.

To provide precise answers, access to the original table and paragraphs is necessary to extract the specific numerical values and calculate the averages.
