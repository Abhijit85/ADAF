    "The increase in net cash used in investing activities was mainly attributable to an increase of $591.5 million in payments for the construction costs of newbuildings and other fixed assets, and a net decrease in cash from short-term investments of $43.0 million in 2018 compared to 2017. These were partially offset by $14.0 million in payments made for the investment in Gastrade in 2017 and an increase of $2.1 million in cash from interest income.",
