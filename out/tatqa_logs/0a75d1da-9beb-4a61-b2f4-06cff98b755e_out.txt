=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals significant changes in asset and liability structures, with notable shifts in specific categories. 

1. Total assets and liabilities both increased by $5.2 million, maintaining a stable ratio of total liabilities to total assets (94.9/540.6→100.1/545.8), indicating balanced growth in financial obligations and resources.
2. A significant increase in property and equipment, net, by $9.3 million (79.3→88.6) suggests substantial investment in physical assets, potentially enhancing operational capacity.
3. Goodwill decreased by $7.4 million (261.3→253.9), which may reflect adjustments in the valuation of acquired entities or impairment considerations.
4. The appearance of operating lease right-of-use-assets with an increase of $4.3 million (0→4.3) highlights a new accounting recognition, possibly due to changes in lease agreements or accounting standards.
