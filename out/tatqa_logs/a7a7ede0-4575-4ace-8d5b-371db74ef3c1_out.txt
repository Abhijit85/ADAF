=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The group's revenue has experienced significant growth, with notable contributions from various regions and a potential dependency on key distributors.

1. Total revenue increased by 71.6, from 639.0 to 710.6, indicating robust overall growth across the group's operations.
2. The USA remains the largest contributor to total revenue, accounting for approximately 31.3% (222.2/710.6), highlighting its critical role in the group's financial performance.
3. Revenue from other countries collectively represents the highest portion at approximately 36.8% (261.7/710.6), underscoring the importance of diverse international markets.
4. Despite the growth, there is a potential risk due to revenue concentration among distributors, with two distributors each accounting for "15 per cent" of group billings in 2019, which could imply dependency risks.
