=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The Group's current receivables stand at $23762000, with an expected loss rate of 1% and a loss allowance provision of $238000, representing 85.3% of total net receivables. 

1. The gross carrying amount for current receivables is $23762000, which has decreased by $4558000 from the total gross carrying amount of $28320000. 
2. The Group's expected loss rate for current receivables is 1%, leading to a loss allowance provision of $238000. This provision is determined using the lifetime expected loss provision for all trade receivables, as per the simplified approach prescribed by AASB 9.
3. The difference between total net receivables and current net receivables is $4055000, with current net receivables making up 85.3% of total net receivables.
4. The Group's credit risk management strategy includes credit evaluations and regular monitoring of outstanding customer receivables, with the aim to minimise concentration of credit risk by transacting with a large number of customers. However, more than 37% of total data centre services revenue is derived from just two customers, indicating a potential concentration of credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying value of each class of the financial assets and each class of receivable.
