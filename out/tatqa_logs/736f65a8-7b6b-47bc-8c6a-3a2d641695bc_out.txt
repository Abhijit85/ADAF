=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of the aging of receivables highlights increasing credit risk as receivables age, with significant implications for financial management.

1. **Loss Rate Increase**: The expected loss rate escalates with the age of receivables, starting at 1% for current receivables and rising to 20% for those over 60 days, indicating heightened risk with aging.
   
2. **Gross Carrying Amount Decline**: There is a notable decrease in the gross carrying amount as receivables age, from 23762 for current to 1703 for those more than 60 days old, although an anomaly is observed with the 'More than 60 days' category being higher than '31 to 60 days'.

3. **Loss Allowance Provisions**: The loss allowance provision as a percentage of the gross carrying amount increases with aging, from 1% for current to 20% for more than 60 days, reflecting the increased expected loss.

4. **Net Receivables Decline**: Net receivables also decrease with aging, from 23524 for current to 1362 for more than 60 days, with the percentage of net receivables to gross carrying amount dropping from 98.99% to 79.97%.

Answer Echoes:
- [RATIO] The expected loss rate increases with aging: 1% (Current) → 5% (0 to 30 days) → 7.5% (31 to 60 days) → 20% (More than 60 days).
- [TREND] Gross carrying amount decreases as aging increases: 23,762 (Current) → 2,068 (0 to 30 days) → 787 (31 to 60 days) → 1,703 (More than 60 days).

- [ANOMALY] The gross carrying amount for 'More than 60 days' (1,703) is higher than '31 to 60 days' (787), despite higher aging.
- [OUTLIER] The loss allowance provision for 'More than 60 days' (341) is significantly higher than other categories, reflecting the highest expected loss rate.
