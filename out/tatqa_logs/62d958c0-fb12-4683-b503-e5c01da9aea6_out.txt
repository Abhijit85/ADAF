=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's financial performance has shown significant fluctuations, with a notable increase in operating income from 2018 to 2019, despite a low diluted earnings per share in 2018. 
1. The company's diluted earnings per share hit a low in 2018 at $(0.19), indicating a period of financial difficulty.
2. However, there was a significant improvement in the operating income (loss), which increased by $4751 million from 2018 to 2019 ($  (6986) → $  (2235)).
3. The average operating income (loss) across 2017, 2018, and 2019 was $  (1828), suggesting a generally challenging financial period for the company.
4. The company's financial performance is significantly influenced by contract estimates, which impact operations and cash flows. The company uses a "cost-to-cost" method of revenue recognition and the "cumulative catch-up method of accounting" to record changes from prior estimates.
5. The company's estimated profit rate at completion for all fixed-price contracts could affect the operating income, and changes in underlying assumptions could lead to materially different amounts being recorded.
6. Long-term, fixed-price contracts represented approximately 97% of the company's sales for 2019, indicating a heavy reliance on this type of contract for revenue.
