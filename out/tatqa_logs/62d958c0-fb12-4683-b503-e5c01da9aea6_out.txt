=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial performance from 2017 to 2019 shows a concerning negative trend in key metrics, highlighting potential challenges in the company's operations and financial management.

1. **Operating Income Decline**: The operating income experienced a dramatic decline from $5737 in 2017 to $(6986) in 2018, marking a significant drop of $(12723), and slightly improved to $(2235) in 2019, indicating ongoing operational challenges.

2. **Net Income Losses**: Net income from continuing operations also followed a negative trajectory, falling from $3208 in 2017 to $(5146) in 2018, a decrease of $(8354), and further to $(2351) in 2019, reflecting persistent profitability issues.

3. **Earnings Per Share Impact**: Diluted earnings per share decreased from $0.12 in 2017 to $(0.19) in 2018 and $(0.08) in 2019, underscoring the impact of financial losses on shareholder value.

4. **Contractual and Accounting Practices**: With long-term, fixed-price contracts comprising "approximately 97% of our sales for 2019," the use of the "cumulative catch-up method of accounting" and sensitivity to profit rate changes highlight the financial volatility and risk associated with these contracts.
