=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In the period from 2018 to 2019, the shipping industry experienced significant financial improvements despite operational reductions.

1. Voyage Revenue saw a notable increase of 9.8%, rising from 289016 to 317220, while Voyage Expenses decreased by 14.1%, from 165012 to 141770, contributing to a healthier financial outcome.
2. Net Voyage Revenue surged by 41.5%, from 124004 to 175450, indicating improved profitability despite a reduction in operational days.
3. The TCE Rate per day increased significantly by 65.4%, from $13095 to $21655, reflecting enhanced revenue efficiency per operational day.
4. Vessel Calendar Days and Total TCE Days both decreased by approximately 14%, yet the financial metrics improved, suggesting a more efficient use of fleet resources and a favorable market environment, possibly influenced by a spike in Suezmax tanker rates.
