=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The data provides insights into the Deferred Share Units (DSUs) and dividend equivalents issued in 2018 and 2019. 
1. In 2019, the number of DSUs issued was 11328, a significant increase from the average issuance of 8995 between 2018 and 2019. This suggests a higher compensation for board members in 2019.
2. The outstanding DSUs at the beginning of the year increased by 2161 from 40446 in 2018 to 42607 in 2019, indicating a growth in the number of unredeemed DSUs.
3. The average dividend equivalent, a form of reward for DSU holders, was 1071.5 between 2018 and 2019. This implies that DSU holders were treated similarly to shareholders in terms of dividends during this period.
4. The number of DSUs a member receives is determined by the average closing price of the subordinate shares on the TSX, suggesting that the compensation is linked to the company's stock performance. However, the specific numbers for DSUs issued in 2019 and changes in outstanding DSUs from 2018 to 2019 are not provided.
