=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of Deferred Share Units (DSUs) for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2019, reveals significant changes in issuance and redemption patterns.

1. The issued amount of DSUs increased significantly by 4666, from 6662 in 2018 to 11328 in 2019, indicating a substantial rise in compensation offered to Board members.
2. Redemption of DSUs also saw a notable increase of 6802, from (5549) in 2018 to (12351) in 2019, suggesting more Board members left or passed away, triggering redemption.
3. Despite the higher redemption rate in 2019, the outstanding DSUs at the end of the year increased slightly by 72, from 42607 to 42679, highlighting a net growth in DSUs.
4. The ratio of issued to redeemed DSUs shifted from 6662:5549 in 2018 to 11328:12351 in 2019, reflecting a more balanced issuance and redemption dynamic.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Issued amount increased significantly by 4,666 (6,662→11,328) from 2018 to 2019.
- [TREND] Redeemed amount increased by 6,802 ((5,549)→(12,351)) from 2018 to 2019.
- [RATIO] The ratio of issued to redeemed in 2019 is 11,328:12,351, compared to 6,662:5,549 in 2018.
- [ANOMALY] Despite higher redemption in 2019, the outstanding end of year increased slightly by 72 (42,607→42,679).
- [OUTLIER] The increase in issued amount by 4,666 (6,662→11,328) is notably larger than the increase in dividend equivalents by 47 (1,048→1,095).
- [DEFINITION] DSUs are "Deferred Share Units" offered to Board members as part of their compensation.
- [SCOPE] The plan details are relevant for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2019.
- [SOURCE] DSU valuation is based on the "average closing price" of shares on the TSX.
