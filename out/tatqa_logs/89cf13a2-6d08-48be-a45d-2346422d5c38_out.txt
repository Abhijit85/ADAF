=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of financial trends from 2018 to 2020 reveals significant shifts in volatility, interest rates, and fair value metrics. 

1. **Volatility Trends**: Expected volatility saw a notable increase from 22.6% in 2018 to 33.5% in 2019, before decreasing to 27.4% in 2020, indicating fluctuating market conditions and investor sentiment.

2. **Interest Rate Movements**: The risk-free interest rate rose from 1.2% in 2018 to 2.0% in 2019, then slightly decreased to 1.7% in 2020, reflecting changes in monetary policy and economic outlook.

3. **Fair Value Changes**: The weighted-average fair value at grant date increased significantly from $21.93 in 2018 to $34.72 in 2019, and further to $35.66 in 2020, driven by options assumed in business combinations.

4. **Expected Term Adjustments**: The expected term for options decreased from 0.9 years in 2018 to 0.8 years in 2019, and further to 0.6 years in 2020, suggesting a shift towards shorter-term financial planning.
