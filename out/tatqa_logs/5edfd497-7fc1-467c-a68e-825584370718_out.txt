The analysis of income tax expense for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 reveals significant shifts in both federal and state components.

1. **Federal Trend**: The current federal income tax expense decreased by $154326, from $1294253 to $1139927, indicating a reduction in federal tax obligations.
   
2. **State Trend**: The state income tax expense saw a slight increase of $5292, moving from $423209 to $428501, suggesting a minor rise in state tax liabilities.

3. **Deferred Anomalies**: Both federal and state deferred tax components shifted from negative to positive values, with federal increasing by $504632 (from ($470166) to $34466) and state by $89402 (from ($83296) to $6106), highlighting a reversal in deferred tax positions.

4. **Overall Impact**: The total income tax expense rose by $445000, from $1164000 to $1609000, reflecting an overall increase in tax expenses despite the changes in individual components.
