=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's financial data as of December 31, 2019, reveals significant changes in deferred tax assets and valuation allowances, indicating potential challenges in realizing these assets.

1. The operating loss carryforward increased by 15492, from 57768 to 73260, suggesting a growing accumulation of losses that could impact future profitability.
   
2. The net deferred tax asset before valuation allowance rose by 3995, from 15916 to 19911, reflecting an increase in potential tax benefits from temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards.

3. A full valuation allowance of 19911 was applied, exactly offsetting the net deferred tax asset before valuation allowance, which indicates management's belief that these tax benefits will not be realized in the foreseeable future.

4. Despite these changes, the net deferred tax asset remained nearly constant, with a slight increase of 23, from 772 to 795, highlighting the impact of the valuation allowance on the company's financial position.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Operating loss carryforward increased by 15,492 (57,768→73,260)
- [TREND] Net deferred tax asset before valuation allowance increased by 3,995 (15,916→19,911)
- [TREND] Valuation allowance increased by 3,995 ((15,916)→(19,911))
- [RATIO] Net deferred tax asset remains nearly constant with a slight increase of 23 (772→795)
- [ANOMALY] Valuation allowance exactly offsets net deferred tax asset before valuation allowance in both years, resulting in a net deferred tax asset of 795 and 772 respectively
- [DEFINITION] "Deferred income taxes" are the net tax effects of temporary differences in asset and liability values.
