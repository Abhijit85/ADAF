=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The data provides an overview of a company's tax credit carryforwards, net operating loss carryforwards, and lease obligations for the years 2018 and 2019. 

1. The company's net operating loss carryforwards increased by $590 thousands from 2018 to 2019, reaching a total of $65477 thousands in 2019. This indicates a growth in the company's potential to offset its future taxable income.
2. The average of the company's research and development credits for 2018 and 2019 was $77718 thousands. This suggests a significant investment in R&D activities, which could potentially lead to future tax benefits.
3. In 2019, the company had tax credit carryforwards of approximately $41.8 million, $86.3 million, and $5.7 million for federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions respectively. This shows the company's ability to offset its future tax liabilities across different jurisdictions.
4. The company's lease obligation was less than 500 thousands in 2018, indicating a relatively low financial commitment in terms of leasing. However, the data does not provide information about the lease obligation for other years.
