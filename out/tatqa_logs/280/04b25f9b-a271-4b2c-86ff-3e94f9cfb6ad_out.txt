=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of contract cost management reveals significant growth in prepaid expenses and other assets, reflecting the impact of Topic 606 on asset recognition and amortization practices.

1. Prepaid expenses and other increased from $2083 million at December 31, 2018, to $2578 million at December 31, 2019, indicating a rise in deferred contract costs.
2. Other assets grew from $1812 million at December 31, 2018, to $1911 million at December 31, 2019, suggesting an increase in non-current deferred contract costs.
3. Total assets rose from $3895 million at December 31, 2018, to $4489 million at December 31, 2019, highlighting the overall expansion in asset base due to contract cost capitalization.
4. The amortization of deferred contract costs resulted in expenses of $2.7 billion in 2019, up from $2.0 billion in 2018, reflecting the ongoing impact of Topic 606 on financial reporting.

Answer Echoes:
- "Topic 606 requires the recognition of an asset for incremental costs to obtain a customer contract."
- "Costs to obtain a contract are amortized and recorded ratably as commission expense over the period representing the transfer of goods or services."
- "Costs to obtain wireless contracts are amortized over both of our Consumer and Business customers’ estimated device upgrade cycles."
- "Costs to obtain wireline contracts are amortized as expense over the estimated customer relationship period for our Consumer customers."
- "Incremental costs to obtain wireline contracts for our Business customers are insignificant."
- "Costs to obtain contracts are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense."
- "Contract fulfillment costs are expensed as we satisfy our performance obligations and recorded to Cost of services."
- "Deferred contract costs are classified as current or non-current within Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets, respectively."
- "For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recognized expense of $2.7 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, associated with the amortization of deferred contract costs."
- "There have been no impairment charges recognized for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018."
- "Prepaid expenses and other at December 31, 2019: $2,578 million" and "Prepaid expenses and other at December 31, 2018: $2,083 million."
- "Other assets at December 31, 2019: $1,911 million" and "Other assets at December 31, 2018: $1,812 million."
- "Total assets at December 31, 2019: $4,489 million" and "Total assets at December 31, 2018: $3,895 million."
