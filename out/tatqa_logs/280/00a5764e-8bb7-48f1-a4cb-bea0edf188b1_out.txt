=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of the company's stock options from 2017 to 2019 reveals trends in dividend yield, volatility, and option valuation.

1. **Dividend Yield**: The dividend yield slightly decreased from 4.6% in 2018 to 4.5% in 2019, following a previous increase from 4.1% in 2017.
   
2. **Expected Volatility**: Expected volatility showed a minor decline from 28.7% in 2018 to 28.3% in 2019, after rising from 27.1% in 2017, indicating a slight stabilization in stock price fluctuations.

3. **Risk-Free Interest Rate and Expected Life**: The risk-free interest rate remained constant at 2.5% for 2018 and 2019, up from 2.0% in 2017, while the expected life of the option term slightly decreased from 4.5 years in 2017 to 4.3 years in 2019.

4. **Grant Date Fair Value**: The weighted-average per share grant date fair value of options increased from $7.06 in 2017 to $8.45 in 2018, and further to $8.92 in 2019, reflecting a rise in the perceived value of the options granted.

Answer Echoes:
- The company uses "expected dividend yield" based on "expected annual dividends and the Company’s stock price" for stock options.
- "Expected Volatility" is determined using "historical volatility for a period commensurate with the expected term of the option."
- The "Risk-Free Interest Rate" is based on the "zero coupon US Treasury rate" for a term similar to the option's expected term.
- "Expected Term of the Option" is estimated by analyzing "historical stock option exercises."
- "Forfeiture Rates" are estimated from "historical data" considering the employee class receiving the options or shares.
- The "weighted-average per share grant date fair value of options" was "$8.92 in 2019," "$8.45 in 2018," and "$7.06 in 2017."
- For 2019, the "dividend yield" is "4.5%," "expected volatility" is "28.3%," "risk-free interest rate" is "2.5%," and "expected life" is "4.3 years."
- For 2018, the "dividend yield" is "4.6%," "expected volatility" is "28.7%," "risk-free interest rate" is "2.5%," and "expected life" is "4.4 years."
- For 2017, the "dividend yield" is "4.1%," "expected volatility" is "27.1%," "risk-free interest rate" is "2.0%," and "expected life" is "4.5 years."
