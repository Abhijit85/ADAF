=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of deferred tax assets and liabilities from April 2018 to April 2019 reveals key changes influenced by tax rate adjustments and valuation allowances.

1. **Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities (2019 vs. 2018):** As of April 26, 2019, deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, were $303 million, compared to $286 million on April 27, 2018. Deferred tax liabilities increased from $89 million in 2018 to $104 million in 2019.

2. **Net Deferred Tax Position:** The net deferred tax assets, after accounting for liabilities, were $199 million in 2019, slightly up from $197 million in 2018, indicating a stable net tax position despite changes in gross assets and liabilities.

3. **Valuation Allowance Impact:** The valuation allowance increased by $14 million in fiscal 2019, reflecting adjustments in deferred tax assets, which impacted the net deferred tax assets.

4. **Tax Rate Changes and Expenses:** The U.S. federal corporate income tax rate change led to a remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities in fiscal 2018, resulting in a $108 million tax expense and a $732 million discrete tax expense for the transition tax.
