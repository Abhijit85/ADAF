=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In 2019, the company experienced a significant increase in net financing costs, driven by various financial challenges.

1. Net financing costs surged from €389m in 2018 to €1655m in 2019, primarily due to mark-to-market losses of €423m and foreign exchange losses of €190m, compared to gains in 2018.
2. Investment income decreased significantly from €685m in 2018 to €433m in 2019, reflecting a downturn in investment performance.
3. Financing costs more than doubled, rising from €1074m in 2018 to €2088m in 2019, largely due to increased interest costs associated with the Liberty Global transaction.
4. Despite these challenges, underlying financing costs remained stable, indicating consistent average net debt balances and weighted average borrowing costs.
