=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial obligations are primarily driven by long-term debt, with significant short-term commitments and a notable increase in operating lease obligations over time.

1. Long-term debt is the largest component of total obligations, amounting to $10556.6 million, highlighting a significant long-term financial commitment.
2. Short-term financial obligations are substantial, with purchase obligations and other contracts totaling $1195.3 million due in less than one year, indicating a heavy short-term financial burden.
3. The distribution of long-term debt shows a strategic deferral, with $5522.0 million due after five years, more than double the $2747.6 million due in 1-3 years, suggesting a focus on long-term financial planning.
4. Operating lease obligations are set to increase over time, from $52.1 million due in less than one year to $114.4 million after five years, reflecting a growing commitment to lease agreements.
