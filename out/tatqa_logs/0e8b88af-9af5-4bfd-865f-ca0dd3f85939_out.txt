=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The data provides insights into the company's contractual obligations, debt payment schedules, and pension obligations. 
1. The company's highest contractual obligation is its long-term debt, which stands at $10556.6 million. This is a significant financial commitment that could impact the company's future financial planning and operations.
2. Nearly half (47.4%) of the company's long-term debt payments are due within the next five years. This indicates a substantial short-term financial obligation that the company must prepare for.
3. The company's total notes payable constitute a small fraction (0.6%) of its total capital lease obligations. This suggests that the company's lease obligations significantly outweigh its notes payable.
4. The company also has unfunded pension and postretirement benefit obligations, which are reassessed each fiscal year. The estimated payments for these obligations over the next year are $14.2 million and $10.8 million respectively. This adds another layer of financial responsibility for the company.
5. Lamb Weston is identified as an entity with a guarantee arrangement with the company, although the details of this arrangement are not provided.

Answer Echoes:
- [OUTLIER] The highest total value among the contractual obligations is for long-term debt with $10,556.6 million
- [RATIO] The proportion of long-term debt payments due in 5 years or below is 47.4% (($2,747.6 + $2,287.0)/$10,556.6)
- [RATIO] The ratio of total notes payable to total capital lease obligations is 0.6% ($1.0/$165.4)
- Unfunded pension and postretirement benefit obligations are remeasured each fiscal year.
- Estimated payments for pension and postretirement plans over the next twelve months are $14.2 million and $10.8 million respectively.
- Lamb Weston is an entity with a guarantee arrangement with the company.
- The context does not provide information on the highest total value of contractual obligation, the proportion of long-term debt payments due in 5 years or below, or the ratio of total notes payable to total capital lease obligations.
