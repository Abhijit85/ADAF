=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's cloud and license revenues and expenses saw significant changes between 2018 and 2019, with varying contributions from different regions. 
1. The Americas region contributed significantly more to the cloud and license revenues in 2018 than the Asia Pacific region, with a difference of $13182 million. 
2. Total applications revenues saw a slight increase from $11065 million in 2018 to $11510 million in 2019. 
3. Cloud and license expenses also increased by 5% in actual terms and 6% in constant currency terms from $3441 million in 2018 to $3597 million in 2019. This increase was attributed to higher sales and marketing expenses, employee-related expenses, and technology infrastructure expenses. 
4. The EMEA region contributed 4% to the constant currency revenue growth in fiscal 2019, which was 1% less than the Americas region's contribution. However, specific details on the cloud license segments total margin for 2018 and 2019 were not provided, making it difficult to determine the cause of the increase.
