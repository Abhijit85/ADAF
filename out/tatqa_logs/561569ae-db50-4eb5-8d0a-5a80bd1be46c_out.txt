=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The table provides a detailed breakdown of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the years 2018 and 2019, revealing a net deferred tax liability of $(2780) million as of December 31, 2019. 
1. The deferred tax liabilities are primarily due to depreciation differences in property, plant, and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, and other unspecified items. 
2. The deferred tax assets are composed of four components: post-retirement and pension benefit costs, net operating loss carryforwards, other employee benefits, and other unspecified items. 
3. The total amount reflected as a long-term liability increased from $(2397) million in 2018 to $(2780) million in 2019. 
4. The 'Other' category under deferred tax assets saw a decrease of approximately -4.32% from 2018 to 2019. 
5. The net deferred tax liability for 2019 and 2018 was "$2.8 billion" and "$2.4 billion", respectively, with "$2.9 billion" and "$2.5 billion" of this reflected as a long-term liability. 
6. A "net noncurrent deferred tax asset" of "$118 million" and "$131 million" was reflected for 2019 and 2018, respectively. However, the context does not provide detailed information on the components of deferred tax assets or the percentage change in the 'Other' category for these assets.
