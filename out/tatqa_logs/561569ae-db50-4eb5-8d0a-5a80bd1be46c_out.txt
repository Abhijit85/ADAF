=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals significant shifts in tax and liability figures between 2018 and 2019, impacting the company's fiscal landscape.

1. Post-retirement and pension benefit costs saw an increase of $58 million, rising from $1111 million to $1169 million, indicating higher future obligations for the company.
2. Net operating loss carryforwards decreased by $278 million (from $3445 million to $3167 million), suggesting improved profitability or utilization of past losses.
3. Gross deferred tax assets decreased by $224 million (from $5271 million to $5047 million), while net deferred tax assets decreased by $212 million (from $3940 million to $3728 million), reflecting changes in tax planning or asset valuation.
4. Property, plant, and equipment liabilities increased significantly by $478 million (from $3011 million to $3489 million), indicating potential expansion or increased capital investment, while goodwill and other intangible assets liabilities decreased by $284 million (from $3303 million to $3019 million), possibly due to asset revaluation or amortization.
