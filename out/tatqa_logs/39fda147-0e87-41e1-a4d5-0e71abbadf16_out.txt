=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In 2019, the company experienced a significant increase in operating expenses, driven by substantial rises in both selling, general and administrative, and research, development, and engineering costs.

1. Selling, general and administrative expenses surged by $9577144, marking a 64.7% increase from $14794205 to $24371349, largely due to $4.4 million from MOI and $2.0 million from GP legacy businesses, alongside $1.0 million in transaction costs related to the GP acquisition.

2. Research, development, and engineering expenses nearly doubled, increasing by $3729852 (99.0%) from $3766160 to $7496012, with $1.1 million attributed to MOI and $2.7 million to GP legacy businesses, highlighting a strategic focus on innovation.

3. Total operating expenses rose by $13306996 (71.7%) from $18560365 to $31867361, with selling, general and administrative expenses accounting for approximately 76.5% and research, development, and engineering expenses representing about 23.5% of the total.

4. The 99.0% increase in research, development, and engineering expenses is an outlier compared to other categories, indicating a significant investment in future growth and development initiatives.
