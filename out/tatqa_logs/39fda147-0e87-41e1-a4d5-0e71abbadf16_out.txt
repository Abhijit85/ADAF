=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial data for the years ending December 31, 2018 and 2019 shows a significant increase in both Selling, general and administrative expense and Research, development and engineering expense. 
1. The average Selling, general and administrative expense for the two years was $19582777, with a notable increase from $14794205 in 2018 to $24371349 in 2019. 
2. Similarly, the average Research, development and engineering expense was $5631086, rising from $3766160 in 2018 to $7496012 in 2019. 
3. The increase in expenses is primarily attributed to costs associated with the legacy businesses of MOI and GP. In 2019, the legacy business of GP incurred $2.7 million of Research, development and engineering expense and $2.0 million of Selling, general and administrative expense, while the legacy business of MOI incurred $1.1 million and $4.4 million respectively. 
4. The total operating expense also saw a significant increase from $18560365 in 2018 to $31867361 in 2019. However, the table does not provide information on the research, development and engineering expense associated with the legacy business of GP during the year ended December 31, 2019.
