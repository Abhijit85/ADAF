=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The data shows a decrease in figures for both the UK and Ireland, with the UK accounting for the majority of the total decrease.

1. The UK decreased from 24.9 to 24.5, a change of -0.4.
2. Ireland decreased from 0.5 to 0.4, a change of -0.1.
3. The total decreased from 25.4 to 24.9, a change of -0.5.
4. The decrease in the UK accounts for 80% of the total decrease (0.4 out of 0.5).
5. The decrease in Ireland accounts for 20% of the total decrease (0.1 out of 0.5).
