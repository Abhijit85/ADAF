=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The trends in dividend yield, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected life of the option term from 2017 to 2019 show slight fluctuations, with some metrics decreasing, others increasing, and one remaining constant.

1. The 'Dividend yield' decreased from 4.6% in 2018 to 4.5% in 2019, following an increase from 4.1% in 2017 to 4.6% in 2018.
