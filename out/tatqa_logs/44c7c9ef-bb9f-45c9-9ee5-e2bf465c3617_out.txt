=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The notes provide a snapshot of VMware's lease liabilities, specifically non-cancellable operating and finance leases, over a period of time, with some specific trends and changes noted. 

1. The operating leases for 2021 were $138, but this figure decreased by $3 to $135 in 2022, indicating a slight reduction in these long-term, non-cancellable leases.
2. In contrast, finance leases, another type of long-term, non-cancellable lease, saw a small increase from $6 in 2022 to $7 in 2023, suggesting a slight shift in VMware's leasing strategy.
3. A significant decrease of -25.53% was observed in operating leases between 2024 and 2025, pointing to a substantial reduction in these types of leases in this period.
4. It's important to note that the total lease liabilities as of 2020 are not mentioned, and the data excludes "legally binding lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced of $361 million." This could potentially impact the overall understanding of VMware's lease liabilities.
5. The context does not provide specific data for each year from 2021 to 2025, limiting the ability to fully analyze trends or changes over this period.
