=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's deferred tax assets in 2019 totaled $56.2 million, but were significantly offset by a valuation allowance of $48.6 million, leaving $7.6 million in deferred tax assets unoffset. 
1. The deferred tax assets for Inventory in 2019 were $7144 thousand, showing an increase of $535 thousand from 2018.
2. Deferred tax assets accrued expenses for 2019 were lower, at $2330 thousand.
3. There was a significant decrease in net deferred tax assets between 2018 and 2019, dropping by 80% from $37187 thousand to $7561 thousand.
4. The company established a valuation allowance against domestic deferred tax assets in the third quarter of 2019, indicating a lack of confidence in the realization of these assets. This was further emphasized by the company's inability to conclude that it was more likely than not that our domestic deferred tax assets would be realized.
5. The company continually reviews the adequacy of the valuation allowance and only recognizes the benefits of deferred tax assets when reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.
