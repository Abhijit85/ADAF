=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis from 2018 to 2019 reveals significant shifts in the company's tax and investment landscape, highlighting both trends and anomalies.

1. **Valuation Allowance Surge**: The valuation allowance saw a dramatic increase of $42800, from $(5816) in 2018 to $(48616) in 2019, indicating a substantial adjustment in the company's approach to managing deferred tax assets.

2. **Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities**: Total Deferred Tax Assets decreased by $27132, from $47233 to $20101, while Total Deferred Tax Liabilities increased by $2494, from $10046 to $12540, reflecting a shift in the company's tax position.

3. **Investment and Revenue Concerns**: Investments plummeted from $1122 in 2018 to $0 in 2019, and the company expressed concerns about realizing domestic deferred tax assets due to decreased revenue and profitability.

4. **Emergence of New Liabilities**: Lease liabilities and capitalized research and development expenditures appeared in 2019, with no corresponding values in 2018, suggesting new strategic or operational directions.
