=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of restructuring charges from 2017 to 2019 reveals a general decrease in costs, with notable fluctuations in specific categories.

1. **Employee Severance Costs**: These costs decreased from $7845 in 2018 to $7169 in 2019, indicating a trend of reducing severance-related expenses over the years. However, 2017 was an anomaly with significantly lower costs at $724.

2. **Strategic Alternatives Evaluation**: This cost category emerged in 2019 with an expenditure of $1286, marking it as an outlier since there were no prior records of such costs.

3. **Qdoba Evaluation Costs**: These costs decreased from $2592 in 2017 to $2211 in 2018 and were eliminated by 2019, coinciding with the Qdoba Sale.

4. **Overall Cost Reduction**: Total restructuring-related costs decreased by $2192 from $10647 in 2018 to $8455 in 2019, reflecting effective cost management strategies.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Employee severance and related costs decreased over the years: $7,845 (2018) → $7,169 (2019).
- [ANOMALY] Employee severance and related costs were significantly lower in 2017 at $724 compared to subsequent years.
- [OUTLIER] Strategic Alternatives Evaluation costs appeared only in 2019 at $1,286, with no prior records.
- [TREND] Qdoba Evaluation costs decreased from $2,592 (2017) to $2,211 (2018) and then disappeared in 2019.
- [ANOMALY] Other costs were recorded only in 2017 ($315) and 2018 ($591), with no entry in 2019.
- [RATIO] Total costs decreased from $10,647 (2018) to $8,455 (2019), a reduction of $2,192.
- [DEFINITION] "Restructuring charges" include costs from strategic evaluations and administrative cost reduction.
- [SCOPE] Costs are related to activities in 2018 and 2019.
- [SOURCE] Charges include "third party advisory services" and "retention compensation".
- [NOTE] Qdoba Evaluation led to the "Qdoba Sale".
- [WARNING] Refer to Note 10 for details on the Qdoba Sale.
