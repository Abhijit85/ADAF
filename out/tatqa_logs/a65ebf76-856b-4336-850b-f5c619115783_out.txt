=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In the recent financial review, there was a notable shift in the composition of fees, with significant changes in audit and tax-related expenses.

1. **Audit Fees** saw a substantial increase of $1625688, rising from $16014014 to $17639702, which contributed to Audit Fees as a percentage of Total Fees increasing from 91.8% to 98.5%.
   
2. **Tax Fees** experienced a dramatic decrease of $1199700, plummeting from $1318798 to $119098, marking a 91% reduction from 2018 to 2019, and reducing their share of Total Fees from 7.6% to 0.7%.

3. **Total Fees** overall increased by $472663, from $17439340 to $17912003, despite the significant drop in Tax Fees, indicating a shift in the allocation of financial resources towards audit-related services.

4. The **pre-approval requirement** for non-audit services, capped at $250000 per fiscal quarter, underscores the emphasis on maintaining auditor independence amidst these financial adjustments.
