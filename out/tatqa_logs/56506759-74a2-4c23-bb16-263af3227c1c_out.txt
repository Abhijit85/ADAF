=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of intangible assets reveals key insights into their valuation and useful life, highlighting potential areas for strategic focus and financial planning.

1. Purchased technology stands out with the highest fair value of $232 and a useful life of 4.2 years, translating to an annual value of $55.24, indicating its significant role in the asset portfolio.
2. Customer relationships and lists, valued at $215 with a 7.0-year lifespan, contribute $30.71 per year, underscoring their long-term importance in sustaining business operations.
3. Trademarks and tradenames, with a fair value of $25 and a 5.0-year useful life, provide a modest annual value of $5.00, reflecting their lesser impact compared to other assets.
4. Other intangible assets, valued at $20 with the shortest useful life of 2.0 years, yield $10.00 annually, suggesting a need for timely utilization to maximize their benefit.

Answer Echoes:
- [RATIO] Purchased technology has a fair value of $232 with a useful life of 4.2 years, resulting in a value per year of $55.24 ($232/4.2).
- [RATIO] Customer relationships and customer lists have a fair value of $215 with a useful life of 7.0 years, resulting in a value per year of $30.71 ($215/7.0).
- [RATIO] Trademarks and tradenames have a fair value of $25 with a useful life of 5.0 years, resulting in a value per year of $5.00 ($25/5.0).
- [RATIO] Other intangible assets have a fair value of $20 with a useful life of 2.0 years, resulting in a value per year of $10.00 ($20/2.0).
- [OUTLIER] Purchased technology has the highest fair value at $232, which is significantly higher than other categories.
- [OUTLIER] Other intangible assets have the shortest useful life at 2.0 years, which is less than half of the next shortest useful life (trademarks and tradenames at 5.0 years).
- [ANOMALY] The total fair value of definite-lived intangible assets is $492, but the sum of individual fair values is $492 ($232 + $215 + $25 + $20), which matches, indicating no discrepancies.
- [DEFINITION] "Goodwill" is the excess purchase consideration over net tangible and identifiable intangible assets.
- [SCOPE] The allocation is "subject to change within the measurement period."
- [SOURCE] Valuations are based on "management's estimates and assumptions."
- [NOTE] Goodwill and intangible assets "will not be deductible for tax purposes."
- [WARNING] Changes may occur as "additional information is received and tax returns are finalized."
