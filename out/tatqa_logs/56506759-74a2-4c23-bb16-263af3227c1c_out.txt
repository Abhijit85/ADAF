=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis provides insights into the fair value of various intangible assets and their weighted-average useful lives. 
1. The fair value of trademarks and tradenames is $25, a small fraction of the total definite-lived intangible assets valued at $492. This indicates that trademarks and tradenames constitute a minor portion of the total intangible assets.
2. Other intangible assets represent 4.07% of the total intangible assets acquired, suggesting a relatively small proportion of the overall intangible asset portfolio.
3. There is a significant difference in the fair value amount between purchased technology and trademarks and tradenames, amounting to $207. This suggests that purchased technology holds a higher value compared to trademarks and tradenames.
4. The weighted-average useful lives of Trademarks and tradenames and Other intangible assets differ by 3.0 years, indicating a longer lifespan for the former. This could potentially impact the depreciation schedule and the long-term value of these assets.

Answer Echoes:
- [ANOMALY] Goodwill is not mentioned in the table
- [RATIO] The fair value of trademarks and tradenames is $25
- [RATIO] The total definite-lived intangible assets are valued at $492
- [RATIO] The fair value amount of Other intangible assets as a percentage of total intangible assets acquired is 4.07% (20/492*100)
- [TREND] The difference in the fair value amount between purchased technology and trademarks and tradenames is $207 ($232-$25)
- [TREND] The difference in the Weighted-Average Useful Lives between Trademarks and tradenames and Other intangible assets is 3.0 years (5.0-2.0)
