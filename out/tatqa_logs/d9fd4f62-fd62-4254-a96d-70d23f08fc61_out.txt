=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In 2019, FCC licenses experienced a net increase, primarily driven by acquisitions, despite some impairments and sales.

1. FCC licenses increased by $15.6 million, from $120.6 million to $136.2 million, contributing significantly to the overall total increase from $123.1 million to $138.7 million.
2. The ratio of FCC licenses to the total value was 98.2% in 2019, slightly up from 98.0% in 2018, indicating a stable proportion of FCC licenses within the total asset pool.
3. An $18.2 million increase in FCC licenses was attributed to acquisitions, while impairments and sales led to a $2.6 million reduction, highlighting the impact of strategic acquisitions and market adjustments.
4. Impairments were due to forfeiting licenses in lower-ranked markets, but no significant future cash flow changes are expected from these forfeitures, suggesting a minimal long-term financial impact.
