=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals significant changes in interest and foreign exchange expenses, impacting overall income and expenses.

1. Interest income saw a substantial increase of $1205 (92%), rising from $1310 to $2515, driven by higher balances and yields.
2. Interest expense experienced a dramatic rise of $5342, from $(598) to $(5940), primarily due to long-term debt and lease obligations, including $3.3 million for long-term debt and $2.0 million for headquarters construction.
3. Foreign exchange expense and other, net, decreased by $3083, from $(3439) to $(356), with a notable $1.9 million reduction in foreign exchange expense contributing to this change.
4. Total other income (expense), net, decreased by $1054, from $(2727) to $(3781), influenced by a $0.9 million sublease income, yet marked as 'not meaningful' due to the overall context.
