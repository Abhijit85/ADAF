=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's financial activities from 2018 to 2019 saw a significant increase in both interest income and interest expense. 
1. The interest income, which is the increase in income due to higher balances and yields on investments, rose by $1205, from $1310 in 2018 to $2515 in 2019. This represents a substantial growth in the company's investment returns.
2. However, the interest expense, which refers to the cost incurred due to long-term debt and financing lease obligations, also saw a dramatic increase. It rose by $5342, from $598 in 2018 to $5940 in 2019, indicating a significant rise in the company's debt-related costs.
3. The total other income (expense), net was less than -3000 thousands in both years, with $-2727 in 2018 and $-3781 in 2019, showing a consistent negative trend.
4. The foreign exchange expense and other, net decreased by $3.1 million, suggesting a reduction in the company's foreign exchange costs and other related expenses. However, the context does not provide specific data for the years 2018 and 2019 or total other income (expense), net less than -3000 thousands.
