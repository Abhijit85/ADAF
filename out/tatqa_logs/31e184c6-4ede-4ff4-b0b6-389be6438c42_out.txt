=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's financial data for 2018 and 2019 reveals a net loss in 2019 and an increase in weighted-average common stock outstanding. 
1. The Earnings Per Share (EPS) is calculated using the two-class method, which includes common stock and participating securities. This method divides the net income attributable to common stock by the weighted average common shares outstanding.
2. In 2019, the company experienced a net loss of $(31.5), which is attributable to common stock and participating preferred stockholders. This loss resulted in the company having no dilutive common share equivalents for that year.
3. The weighted-average common stock outstanding increased by 0.5 from 44.3 in 2018 to 44.8 in 2019. This increase could potentially dilute the value of existing shares.
4. The average unvested restricted stock and preferred stock (as-converted basis) were calculated as 0.5 and 3.5 respectively. These stocks are considered participating securities as they have non-forfeitable rights to dividends.

Answer Echoes:
- [RATIO] Earnings Per Share (EPS) is calculated by dividing the net income attributable to common stock by the weighted average common shares outstanding
- [ANOMALY] The company did not have any dilutive common share equivalents in 2019 as the effect of assumed shares under treasury stock method for stock options and restricted shares and if-converted method for convertible instruments was zero
- [TREND] The Net (loss) income attributable to common stock and participating preferred stockholders in 2019 was $(31.5)
- [TREND] The increase in the Weighted-average common stock outstanding from 2018 to 2019 was 0.5 (44.3→44.8)
- [RATIO] The average unvested restricted stock is 0.5 ((0.4+0.6)/2)
- [RATIO] The average Preferred stock (as-converted basis) is 3.5 ((4.9+2.1)/2)
