=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals a significant decline in net income attributable to common stockholders, highlighting shifts in stockholder allocations and share metrics.

1. Net income attributable to common stockholders decreased by $187.1 million, from $155.6 million to a loss of $(31.5) million, indicating a substantial downturn in profitability.
2. The percentage of loss allocated to common stock increased by 5%, from 89.3% to 94.3%, while the allocation to preferred stock decreased by 5.5%, from 9.9% to 4.4%, reflecting a shift in the burden of losses towards common stockholders.
3. The weighted average common shares outstanding on a diluted basis fell by 2.0 million, from 46.8 million to 44.8 million, suggesting a reduction in the potential dilution of shares.
4. Net income attributable to participating security holders saw a notable decrease, with basic figures dropping by $3.80, from $3.14 to $(0.66), and diluted figures decreasing by $3.56, from $2.90 to $(0.66), indicating a significant impact on these stakeholders.
