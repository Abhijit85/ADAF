=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial performance shows significant growth in orders and revenue, but profitability challenges persist.

1. Orders increased by 874 million € (11875→12749), reflecting a consistent 7% growth, primarily driven by large orders in Asia and the Americas.
2. Revenue rose by 1105 million € (9122→10227), marking a 12% growth, with notable increases in Europe, C. I. S., Africa, and the Middle East, despite declines elsewhere.
3. Adjusted EBITA remained almost unchanged (483→482), resulting in a 0% change, which, coupled with a decrease in the adjusted EBITA margin from 5.3% to 4.7%, indicates reduced profitability.
4. The revenue growth rate of 12% outpaced the 7% growth in orders, suggesting potential improvements in efficiency or pricing strategies, although adverse price developments have affected market volume in euros.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Orders increased by 874 million € (11,875→12,749) with a consistent 7% growth.
- [TREND] Revenue increased by 1,105 million € (9,122→10,227) with a consistent 12% growth.
- [ANOMALY] Adjusted EBITA remained almost unchanged (483→482), showing a 0% change despite revenue growth.
- [RATIO] Adjusted EBITA margin decreased from 5.3% to 4.7%, indicating reduced profitability relative to revenue.
- [OUTLIER] Revenue growth (12%) outpaced orders growth (7%), which may indicate improved efficiency or pricing.
- [RATIO] The decrease in adjusted EBITA margin (5.3%→4.7%) suggests higher costs or lower pricing power.
- [DEFINITION] "Order intake increased" due to "large orders" in Asia and the Americas.
- [SCOPE] Revenue rose in "Europe, C. I. S., Africa, Middle East" but declined in other regions.
- [NOTE] "Adjusted EBITA was on the prior-year level" despite revenue growth.
- [WARNING] "Adverse price development" affected market volume in euros.
- [SOURCE] Severance charges were "€ 32 million in fiscal 2019" and "€ 77 million in fiscal 2018".
- [SCOPE] "SGRE’s order backlog was € 26 billion" with € 9 billion expected for fiscal 2020.
- [NOTE] Growth in "onshore business" driven by China and the U.S.; offshore by the U.K. and China.
