=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

SGRE's financial performance showed growth in orders and revenue, but stability in Adjusted EBITA and a decrease in Adjusted EBITDA margin from 2018 to 2019. 
1. The company experienced a 7% increase in order intake, rising from 11875 million € in 2018 to 12749 million € in 2019, driven by large orders from Asia and the Americas. 
2. Revenue also saw a growth of 12%, from 9122 million € to 10227 million €, with the offshore, service, and onshore businesses contributing to this increase. 
3. Despite these positive trends, the Adjusted EBITA remained stable at around 482 million € in 2019 and 483 million € in 2018, due to a balance of positive and negative factors. 
4. The Adjusted EBITDA margin, however, decreased by 0.6%, from 5.3% to 4.7%. 
5. The average order value for the two years was 12312 million €, although specific average order values for each year were not provided.
