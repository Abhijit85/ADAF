3. Indirect energy consumption increased by 31311.65 MWh from 154636.44 to 185948.09.
4. Running water consumption increased by 310336.67 tonnes from 973413.06 to 1283749.73.
5. Recycled water consumption decreased by 1385 tonnes from 5461 to 4076.
6. Total energy consumption per employee increased by 0.16 MWh per employee from 3.28 to 3.44.
7. Total energy consumption per floor area decreased by 0.02 MWh per square metre from 0.14 to 0.12.
8. Running water consumption per employee increased by 2.45 tonnes per employee from 19.07 to 21.52.
