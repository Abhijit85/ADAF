=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The revenue decrease in the UK and Ireland contributed to a total revenue decline, with the UK accounting for the majority of the decrease.

1. UK revenue decreased from 24.9 to 24.5, resulting in a change of -0.4.
2. Ireland revenue decreased from 0.5 to 0.4, resulting in a change of -0.1.
3. Total revenue decreased from 25.4 to 24.9, resulting in a change of -0.5.
4. The decrease in UK revenue accounts for 80% of the total decrease (0.4 out of 0.5).
5. The decrease in Ireland revenue accounts for 20% of the total decrease (0.1 out of 0.5).
