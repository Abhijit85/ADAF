=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The financial metrics from 2017 to 2019 show trends in dividend yield, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and the expected life of option terms, with specific changes in each year.

1. **Dividend Yield Changes:** The dividend yield increased from 4.1% in 2017 to 4.6% in 2018, then decreased slightly to 4.5% in 2019.
2. **Expected Volatility Trends:** Expected volatility rose from 27.1% in 2017 to 28.7% in 2018, before decreasing to 28.3% in 2019.
3. **Risk-Free Interest Rate Stability:** The risk-free interest rate increased from 2.0% in 2017 to 2.5% in 2018 and remained constant at 2.5% in 2019.
4. **Expected Life of Option Term:** The expected life of the option term decreased from 4.5 years in 2017 to 4.4 years in 2018, and further to 4.3 years in 2019.
5. **Grant Date Fair Value of Options:** The weighted-average per share grant date fair value of options was $7.06 in 2017, $8.45 in 2018, and $8.92 in 2019.
