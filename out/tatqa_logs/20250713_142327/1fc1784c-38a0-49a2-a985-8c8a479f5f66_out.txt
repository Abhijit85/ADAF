=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The financial performance from 2017 to 2018 showed an increase in net revenues and operating income, driven by identity and information protection products, despite a slight decrease in operating margin.

1. Net revenues increased by $616 million from $1664 million in 2017 to $2280 million in 2018, primarily due to a $639 million increase from identity and information protection products, offset by a $23 million decrease related to consumer security products.
   
2. Operating income rose by $272 million from $839 million in 2017 to $1111 million in 2018, mainly due to sales of identity and information protection products, although higher related costs and operating expenses partially offset this increase.

3. The percentage of total net revenues increased from 41% in 2017 to 47% in 2018, reflecting a shift to subscription-based contracts and bundling.

4. Despite the increase in net revenues and operating income, the operating margin decreased from 50% in 2017 to 49% in 2018, indicating higher costs relative to revenue growth.

- "Revenue increased $616 million due to a $639 million increase from identity and information protection products."
