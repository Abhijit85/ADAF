=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The data reveals trends in share repurchases, including an increase in the number of shares purchased and the average price per share, alongside a decrease in the remaining purchase capacity under the repurchase program.

1. The total number of shares purchased increased significantly from 262 in the first period to 3380 in the second period and 3608 in the third period.
2. The average price paid per share rose from $64.77 in the first period to $65.53 in the second period and $72.49 in the third period.
3. The remaining purchase capacity under the repurchase program decreased from $2372 million in the first period to $2150 million in the second period and $1889 million in the third period.
4. The average price paid per share over all periods is $68.97.
5. The total number of shares purchased as part of the publicly announced program is consistently higher than the total number of shares purchased in each period, indicating a discrepancy or additional context needed.
6. The first period is an outlier with significantly fewer shares purchased (262) compared to the subsequent periods (3380 and 3608).
