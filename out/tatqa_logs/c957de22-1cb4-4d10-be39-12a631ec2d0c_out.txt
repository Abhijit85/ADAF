=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of RSUs and PSUs from 2017 to 2019 reveals notable trends and anomalies in stock unit grants and vesting patterns.

1. **Increasing Trends**: Both RSUs and PSUs Granted show a consistent upward trend over the years, with RSUs increasing from $484 in 2017 to $674 in 2019, and PSUs from $113 in 2017 to $164 in 2019.

2. **Vesting Anomalies**: RSUs Vested experienced a decline from $463 in 2017 to $381 in 2018, before rising to $428 in 2019, whereas PSUs Vested consistently increased from $51 in 2017 to $118 in 2019.

3. **Grant to Vesting Ratios**: In 2019, the ratio of RSUs Granted to Vested was $674 to $428, and for PSUs, it was $164 to $118, indicating a higher proportion of granted units compared to those vested.

4. **Unrecognized Costs**: As of December 31, 2019, there was $1.1 billion in unrecognized compensation cost for non-vested RSUs, which will be recognized over 2.5 years, impacting future financial statements.
