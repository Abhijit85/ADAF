=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Research and development funding saw significant fluctuations from 2017 to 2019, with an overall increase of $67 million. 
1. The funding for research and development initially decreased by $13 million from 2017 to 2018, dropping from $65 million to $52 million. 
2. However, there was a substantial increase of $80 million in research and development funding from 2018 to 2019, rising from $52 million to $132 million. 
3. The average research and development funding over the three years was approximately $83 million. 
4. Other income, net of expenses, was notably high in 2017 at $55 million. The increase in 2019 was primarily due to grants associated with the European Commission IPCEI, although this was partially offset by higher start-up costs. 
5. The average gain on the sale of businesses and non-current assets over the three years was approximately $6.33 million.
