=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In 2019, the financial landscape showed significant shifts in research funding, costs, and income dynamics.

1. Research and development funding saw a substantial increase, rising from $52 million in 2018 to $132 million in 2019, indicating a strong focus on innovation and growth.
2. Phase-out and start-up costs experienced a notable anomaly, turning negative at $(38) million in 2019 compared to $(1) million in 2018, suggesting a strategic shift or restructuring.
3. Other income and expenses, net, as a percentage of net revenues, more than doubled from 0.5% in 2018 to 1.1% in 2019, reflecting changes in financial management or revenue streams.
4. The net exchange gain (loss) dropped to $0 in 2019 from a consistent $4 million in previous years, highlighting potential impacts from currency fluctuations or hedging strategies.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Research and development funding increased significantly from $52 million in 2018 to $132 million in 2019.
- [ANOMALY] Phase-out and start-up costs were negative in 2019 at $(38) million, a significant change from $(1) million in 2018.
- [OUTLIER] Exchange gain (loss), net remained constant at $4 million in both 2018 and 2017, but dropped to $0 in 2019.
- [TREND] Patent costs decreased from $(9) million in 2017 to $(1) million in 2019.
- [RATIO] Other income and expenses, net as a percentage of net revenues increased from 0.5% in 2018 to 1.1% in 2019.
- [TREND] Gain on sale of businesses and non-current assets remained relatively stable, with a slight increase from $4 million in 2017 to $7 million in 2019.
- [ANOMALY] Other, net shifted from $(2) million in 2018 to $3 million in 2019, indicating a reversal in trend.
- [TREND] Other income and expenses, net increased from $53 million in 2018 to $103 million in 2019.
- [DEFINITION] "Other income, net of expenses" includes grants and start-up costs.
- [SCOPE] In 2019, "other income, net of expenses" was $103 million.
- [SCOPE] In 2018, "other income, net of expenses" was $53 million.
- [SCOPE] In 2017, "other income, net of expenses" was $55 million.
- [SOURCE] 2019 increase due to "grants associated with the programs part of the European Commission IPCEI".
- [NOTE] 2019 figures were "partially offset by a higher level of start-up costs".
- [NOTE] 2018 decrease was "mainly due to lower level of R&D grants".
