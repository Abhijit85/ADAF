=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals a paradoxical situation where revenues decreased, yet net income increased, indicating improved profitability.

1. Revenues decreased by $21.7 million, from $1095.0 million to $1073.3 million, highlighting a downward trend in sales or other revenue streams.
2. Despite the revenue decline, net income rose significantly by $35.9 million, from $70.5 million to $106.4 million, suggesting effective cost management or other profitability-enhancing measures.
3. The net income to revenues ratio improved from 6.44% to 9.91%, underscoring a more efficient conversion of revenues into profit.
4. These results are based on "unaudited supplemental pro forma" data, which include hypothetical scenarios such as the Grakon and Pacific Insight acquisitions, and are not reflective of actual historical performance.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Revenues decreased by $21.7 million ($1,095.0M→$1,073.3M).
- [TREND] Net Income increased by $35.9 million ($70.5M→$106.4M).
- [RATIO] Net Income to Revenues ratio improved from 6.44% ($70.5M/$1,095.0M) to 9.91% ($106.4M/$1,073.3M).
- [ANOMALY] Despite a decrease in Revenues, Net Income increased significantly, suggesting cost reductions or other factors improving profitability.
- [DEFINITION] "Unaudited supplemental pro forma results" are hypothetical financial outcomes.
- [SCOPE] Results assume Grakon acquisition in fiscal 2018 and Pacific Insight in fiscal 2017.
- [SOURCE] Data is for "information purposes only" and not actual historical results.
- [NOTE] Includes "amortization charges" and "depreciation adjustments" for revalued assets.
- [WARNING] Results are "not indicative" of actual operational outcomes if acquisitions occurred as assumed.
