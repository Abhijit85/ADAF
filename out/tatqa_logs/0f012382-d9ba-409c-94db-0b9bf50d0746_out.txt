=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company experienced a decrease in revenues but an increase in net income from 2018 to 2019. 

1. The company's revenues dropped by $21.7 million from $1095.0 million in 2018 to $1073.3 million in 2019, indicating a negative growth in sales or services.
2. Despite the decrease in revenues, the net income increased significantly from $70.5 million in 2018 to $106.4 million in 2019. This suggests that the company may have improved its operational efficiency or reduced its costs.
3. The average net income for the two years was $88.45 million, which is higher than the net income of $70.5 million in 2018 but lower than that of $106.4 million in 2019.
4. The results include adjustments due to acquisitions, which could have influenced the revenues and net income for 2018 and 2019. However, these pro forma results are provided for information purposes only and may not reflect the actual financial performance of the company.
