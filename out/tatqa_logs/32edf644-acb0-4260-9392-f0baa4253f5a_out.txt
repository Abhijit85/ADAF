=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial data from 2016 to 2019 reveals modest revenue growth alongside significant fluctuations in net income and earnings per share, influenced by external factors such as tax legislation and strategic financial decisions.

1. **Revenue and Income Trends**: Total revenues increased slightly from $37047 in 2016 to $39506 in 2019, while net income experienced a notable dip in 2018 to $3587, compared to $9452 in 2017 and $11083 in 2019, largely due to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

2. **Earnings Per Share Volatility**: Earnings per share—diluted dropped significantly to $0.85 in 2018 from $2.24 in 2017, before rising to $2.97 in 2019, reflecting the impact of tax changes and financial adjustments.

3. **Dividend and Asset Management**: Cash dividends declared per common share increased steadily from $0.51 in 2015 to $0.81 in 2019, while total assets decreased from $137851 in 2018 to $108709 in 2019, influenced by stock repurchases and dividend payments.

4. **Debt and Working Capital Adjustments**: Notes payable and other borrowings decreased from $60619 in 2018 to $56167 in 2019 due to repayments, while working capital saw a sharp decline from $57035 in 2018 to $27756 in 2019.
