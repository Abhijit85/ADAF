=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's financial performance over the last five fiscal years has seen fluctuations in operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share, working capital, and total assets. 
1. The average operating income from 2015 to 2019 was $13237.4 million, indicating a relatively stable income generation over the period.
2. There was a significant drop in net income from $9938 million in 2015 to $3587 million in 2018, followed by a sharp rise to $11083 million in 2019. This could be attributed to the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the acquisition of NetSuite Inc. in fiscal 2017.
3. Diluted earnings per share followed a similar trend, decreasing from $2.21 in 2015 to $0.85 in 2018, and then increasing to $2.97 in 2019.
4. The company's working capital and total assets saw a decrease in fiscal 2019 to $27756 million and $108709 million respectively, due to cash used for stock repurchases and dividend payments. This was despite the issuance of long-term senior notes of $10.0 billion and $14.0 billion in fiscal 2018 and 2017 respectively.
