=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's financial records indicate a rise in valuation allowance and a decrease in accruals and reserves between 2018 and 2019, with averages calculated for stock-based compensation and deferred revenue. 

1. The valuation allowance, a reserve set aside to offset deferred tax assets, increased by $2880 from $28541 in 2018 to $31421 in 2019. This suggests a growth in the company's deferred tax assets or a decrease in the likelihood of realizing these assets.
2. Accruals and reserves, which are liabilities that are expected but not yet recorded, decreased significantly from $12129 in 2018 to $7870 in 2019, falling below the 10000 thousand mark in the latter year. This could indicate a reduction in anticipated liabilities or an improvement in the company's financial management.
3. The average stock-based compensation, a non-cash expense that represents the cost of compensating employees in shares or share options, was calculated to be $6505.5 for the two years. This figure provides an insight into the company's remuneration strategy and its reliance on equity as a form of employee compensation.
4. The average deferred revenue, which is income received but not yet earned, was $3169.5 for 2018 and 2019. This suggests a steady stream of income that the company can expect to recognize in future accounting periods.
