=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company experienced growth in its financial performance in 2018, with increases in both adjusted operating income and average invested capital, and a decrease in WACC. 

1. The average invested capital in 2018 was $735.6, which represents a significant amount of resources committed by the company. However, the context does not provide information on the change in this figure between 2018 and 2019.
2. The adjusted operating income (tax effected) increased by $2.1, from $118.6 to $120.7. This indicates an improvement in the company's profitability. Unfortunately, the context does not provide information on the change in this income between 2018 and 2019.
3. The WACC decreased by 0.5%, from 9.5% to 9.0%. This reduction in the cost of capital is beneficial for the company as it reduces the hurdle rate for investments. The context does not provide information on the percentage change in the WACC between 2018 and 2019.
4. The company reviews its internal calculation of WACC annually, which is a good practice for ensuring the accuracy and relevance of this key financial metric.
