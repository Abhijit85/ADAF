=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals a mixed performance with increased operating income but decreased economic returns. 

1. Adjusted operating income saw a modest increase of $2.1, rising from $118.6 to $120.7, indicating some improvement in operational efficiency.
2. Average invested capital experienced a significant rise of $187.5, from $735.6 to $923.1, which is disproportionately larger compared to the increase in operating income, suggesting potential inefficiencies in capital utilization.
3. The after-tax Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) decreased by 3.0 percentage points, from 16.1% to 13.1%, reflecting a decline in the company's ability to generate returns from its investments.
4. Despite a decrease in the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) by 0.5 percentage points, from 9.5% to 9.0%, the Economic Return still fell by 2.5 percentage points, from 6.6% to 4.1%, highlighting challenges in achieving value creation.

Answer Echoes:
- [TREND] Adjusted operating income (tax effected) increased by $2.1 ($118.6→$120.7)
- [TREND] Average invested capital increased significantly by $187.5 ($735.6→$923.1)
- [RATIO] After-tax ROIC decreased by 3.0 percentage points (16.1%→13.1%)
- [TREND] WACC decreased by 0.5 percentage points (9.5%→9.0%)
- [ANOMALY] Economic Return decreased by 2.5 percentage points (6.6%→4.1%) despite an increase in adjusted operating income
- [OUTLIER] The increase in average invested capital ($187.5) is notably larger compared to the increase in adjusted operating income ($2.1)
- [DEFINITION] ROIC is "tax-effected operating income before restructuring" divided by "average invested capital over a rolling five-quarter period."
- [DEFINITION] Invested capital equals "equity plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents."
- [SCOPE] Fiscal years 2018 and 2019 are specifically mentioned with respective ROIC and WACC figures.
- [NOTE] ROIC and Economic Return are "non-GAAP financial measures" used for internal goals and decision-making.
- [WARNING] "Other companies may not define or calculate ROIC in the same way."
- [SOURCE] For detailed reconciliation, refer to "Exhibit 99.1 to this annual report on Form 10-K."
- [SCOPE] Fiscal 2019 ROIC of 13.1% and Economic Return of 4.1% are based on a 9.0% WACC.
