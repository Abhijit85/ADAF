=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The company's financial data reveals notable shifts in asset management, particularly in equipment and leasehold improvements.

1. Machinery and equipment saw a modest increase of $76, rising from $1296 to $1372, indicating ongoing investment in operational assets.
2. Office, computer, and research equipment experienced a more substantial increase of $92, from $5175 to $5267, reflecting a focus on enhancing technological capabilities.
3. A significant anomaly was observed in leasehold improvements, which decreased by $440, from $1238 to $798, suggesting a possible divestment or revaluation of these assets.
4. Overall, land, property, and equipment, net decreased by $303, from $1601 to $1298, driven by a $272 decrease in gross value and an increase in accumulated depreciation and amortization by $31, highlighting the impact of asset aging and depreciation on the company's balance sheet.
