=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial analysis reveals significant shifts in taxation and adjustments, impacting the overall fiscal performance.

1. The company experienced a dramatic financial swing, with a loss before taxation moving from a profit of £20.9m to a loss of £(42.7)m, highlighting a substantial downturn in profitability.
   
2. Taxation dynamics shifted notably, with the income tax credit/(charge) reversing from £(13.7)m to £8.9m, indicating a favorable tax position compared to the previous period.

3. Adjustments to prior periods saw a significant change, moving from £(8.1)m to £1.7m, suggesting revisions in previous financial assessments and capital allowances.

4. Non-deductible items increased from £(0.1)m to £(0.9)m, reflecting higher expenses that do not qualify for tax deductions, potentially affecting net income.
