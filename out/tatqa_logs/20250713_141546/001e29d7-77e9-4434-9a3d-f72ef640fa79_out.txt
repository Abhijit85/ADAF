=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

• The data shows a decrease in values for both the UK and Ireland from 2018 to 2019, contributing to an overall decline.

1. The UK shows a decrease in value from 24.9 in 2018 to 24.5 in 2019, with a change of -0.4.
2. Ireland shows a decrease in value from 0.5 in 2018 to 0.4 in 2019, with a change of -0.1.
3. The total value shows a decrease from 25.4 in 2018 to 24.9 in 2019, with a change of -0.5.
4. The decrease in the UK contributes significantly to the overall decrease in the total value.
5. Ireland's decrease is smaller in absolute terms compared to the UK.
