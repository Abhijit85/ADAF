=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

• The data shows a trend of slight decreases in dividend yield and expected volatility, while the risk-free interest rate remained constant, and the expected life of the option term decreased over the years.

1. The dividend yield decreased from 4.6% in 2018 to 4.5% in 2019.
2. The expected volatility decreased from 28.7% in 2018 to 28.3% in 2019.
3. The risk-free interest rate remained constant at 2.5% from 2018 to 2019.
4. The expected life of the option term decreased from 4.5 years in 2017 to 4.3 years in 2019.
5. The weighted-average per share grant date fair value of options was $8.92 in 2019, $8.45 in 2018, and $7.06 in 2017.
