=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The data provides insights into the financial risk exposure and asset classification changes, with a specific focus on Ireland's financial performance. 
1. The table does not provide specific information about the reclassification of the carrying amount of financial assets, however, it is noted that they were reclassified to "amortised cost under IFRS 9".
2. The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 March 2019 was £59.1m, but the table does not provide this information.
3. The table does not specify the geographic regions that have the maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date.
4. The amount for Ireland was larger in 2018 (£0.5m), but the table does not provide this information. Furthermore, the amount for Ireland decreased by £0.1m (0.5→0.4), representing a 20% decrease.
