=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

From 2018 to 2019, the company experienced a decline in revenue and an increase in credit risk exposure.

1. UK revenue decreased by £0.4m, from £24.9m in 2018 to £24.5m in 2019, while Ireland's revenue saw a smaller decline of £0.1m, from £0.5m to £0.4m.
2. The total revenue fell by £0.5m, from £25.4m in 2018 to £24.9m in 2019, indicating a broader trend of declining sales across the regions.
3. Despite the revenue drop, the revenue distribution between the UK and Ireland remained stable, with the UK consistently contributing approximately 98.4% and Ireland 1.6% of the total revenue in both years.
4. The maximum credit exposure increased from £56.5m in 2018 to £59.1m in 2019, suggesting a heightened risk in financial assets, which are now reported under IFRS 9 instead of the previous IAS 39.
