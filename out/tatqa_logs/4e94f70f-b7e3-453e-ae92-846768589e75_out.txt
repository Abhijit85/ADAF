=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The financial performance for the second half and full year of F19 shows a slight increase in sales but a decrease in normalised ROFE. 
1. Sales in F19 increased by 3.7% from 1612 to 1671 million dollars, indicating a positive growth trend. 
2. The average sales for F19 and F18 was 1641.5 million dollars, suggesting a relatively stable sales performance over the two years. 
3. There was a nominal difference of 11 million dollars in EBITDA between F19 and F18, which could be due to weaker first half trading performance as EBIT decreased by 0.5% on a normalised basis. 
4. Depreciation and Amortisation constituted 29.8% of EBITDA in F19, which might have impacted the company's profitability. 
5. Normalised ROFE, which measures the return on funds employed, decreased by 38 basis points from 13.1 to 12.9, indicating a decline in the efficiency of the company's investments. This could be attributed to factors such as subdued gaming sales, particularly in Victoria, and increasing input cost prices on Food margins which led to a decline in normalised gross profit by 54 basis points.
