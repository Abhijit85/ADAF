=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The financial data from 2017 to 2019 shows trends in gross profit, amortization of acquired intangibles, stock-based compensation, and adjusted gross margin, highlighting consistent improvements and anomalies.

1. Gross profit increased from $72849 in 2017 to $100284 in 2018 (Δ = $27435) and further to $137347 in 2019 (Δ = $37063).
2. Amortization of acquired intangibles decreased from $1614 in 2017 to $1268 in 2018 (Δ = -$346) and increased to $2114 in 2019 (Δ = $846).
3. Stock-based compensation increased significantly from $578 in 2017 to $2306 in 2018 (Δ = $1728) and decreased to $1966 in 2019 (Δ = -$340).
4. Adjusted gross margin increased from $75041 in 2017 to $103858 in 2018 (Δ = $28817) and further to $141427 in 2019 (Δ = $37569).
5. The increase in Adjusted gross margin closely follows the increase in Gross profit for each year, indicating a consistent margin improvement.
