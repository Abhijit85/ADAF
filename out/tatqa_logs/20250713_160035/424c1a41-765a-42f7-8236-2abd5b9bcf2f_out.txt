=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The financial trends from 2017 to 2019 show improvements in beginning and ending balances, alongside increases in bad debt expenses and write-offs.

1. The beginning balance improved from $(2.2) in 2017 to $(1.9) in 2018, and remained stable at $(1.3) in 2019.
2. Bad debt expense increased significantly from $(0.8) in 2017 to $(0.6) in 2018, and further to $(1.6) in 2019.
3. Write-offs, net of recoveries, increased from 1.1 in 2017 to 1.2 in 2018, and further to 1.6 in 2019.
4. The ending balance improved from $(1.9) in 2017 to $(1.3) in 2018, and remained stable at $(1.3) in 2019.

Answer Echoes:
- "management's estimate of uncollectible balances"
- "known troubled accounts, historical experience and other currently available evidence"
- "write off trade receivables when the likelihood of collection is considered remote"
