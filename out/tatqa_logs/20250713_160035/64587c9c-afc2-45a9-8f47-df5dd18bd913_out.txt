6. Accumulated depreciation and amortization increased by $4138, from $16050 to $20188.
7. Property and equipment, net decreased by $1674, from $17512 to $15838.

Answer Echoes:
- "Total depreciation expense on property and equipment was $2.5 million during fiscal 2019."
- "Total amortization expense on capitalized internal-use software was $2.5 million during fiscal 2019."
- "Software had the largest increase: $16,427 - $11,885 = $4,542."
- "Furniture and equipment increased by $11,604 - $10,671 = $933."
- "Leasehold improvements increased slightly by $6,981 - $6,819 = $162."
- "Project expenditures not yet in use decreased significantly by $1,014 - $4,187 = -$3,173."
- "Total property and equipment increased by $36,026 - $33,562 = $2,464."
- "Accumulated depreciation and amortization increased by $20,188 - $16,050 = $4,138."
- "Property and equipment, net decreased by $15,838 - $17,512 = -$1,674."
