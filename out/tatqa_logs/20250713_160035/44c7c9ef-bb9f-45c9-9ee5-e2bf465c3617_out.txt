=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The data highlights a consistent decrease in Operating Leases, stable Finance Leases, and significant differences in financial metrics between the two types of leases.

1. Operating Leases show a consistent downward trend, decreasing from $138 in 2021 to $70 in 2025.
2. Finance Leases remain relatively stable, with a slight increase from $6 in 2021 to $7 in 2023, and staying at $7 thereafter.
3. The total future minimum lease payments for Operating Leases ($1134) are significantly higher than for Finance Leases ($68).
4. Imputed interest for Operating Leases ($279) is much higher than for Finance Leases ($9), indicating a larger financial cost associated with Operating Leases.
5. The 'Thereafter' category for Operating Leases ($577) is substantially higher than any single year, indicating a large portion of payments are due in the long term.
6. The 'Thereafter' category for Finance Leases ($35) is also higher than any single year, but the difference is less pronounced compared to Operating Leases.
7. The total lease liabilities for Operating Leases ($855) are much higher than for Finance Leases ($59), reflecting the larger scale of Operating Leases.

Answer Echoes:
- "Total lease liabilities as of January 31, 2020 excluded legally binding lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced of $361 million."
- "Operating Leases decrease from $138 in 2021 to $70 in 2025, showing a consistent downward trend."
- "Finance Leases remain relatively stable from 2021 to 2025, with a slight increase from $6 in 2021 to $7 in 2023 and remaining at $7 thereafter."
- "The total future minimum lease payments for Operating Leases ($1,134) are significantly higher than for Finance Leases ($68)."
- "Imputed interest for Operating Leases ($279) is much higher than for Finance Leases ($9), indicating a larger financial cost associated with Operating Leases."
- "The 'Thereafter' category for Operating Leases ($577) is substantially higher than any single year, indicating a large portion of payments are due in the long term."
- "The 'Thereafter' category for Finance Leases ($35) is also higher than any single year, but the difference is less pronounced compared to Operating Leases."
- "The total lease liabilities for Operating Leases ($855) are much higher than for Finance Leases ($59), reflecting the larger scale of Operating Leases."
