=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The data highlights changes in non-vested shares, grant date fair values, and equity-based compensation trends for 2019.

1. Non-vested shares increased from 1187586 at December 31, 2018, to 1283281 at December 31, 2019.
2. The net change in shares is 95695, calculated as 473550 (Granted) - 365223 (Vested) - 12632 (Forfeited).
3. The Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value increased from $41.12 to $45.40 over the year.
4. The shares granted (473550) have a significantly higher Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value ($53.53) compared to the overall average at year-end ($45.40).
5. The ratio of Vested to Granted shares is approximately 0.77 (365223 / 473550).
6. Forfeited shares (12632) are a small fraction of the total shares, indicating low forfeiture rates.
