4. **Change in Fair Value of Hedging Instruments:** The change in fair value of outstanding hedging instruments since 1 January shifted from a positive 181 RMB’Million in 2018 to a negative (2139) RMB’Million in 2019.

5. **Change in Value of Hedged Item:** The change in value of the hedged item used to determine hedge effectiveness mirrored the change in fair value, moving from 181 RMB’Million in 2018 to (2139) RMB’Million in 2019.

6. **Weighted Average Hedged Rate Increase:** The weighted average hedged rate increased from 1.60% in 2018 to 2.10% in 2019.

Answer Echoes:
- "The Group entered into certain interest rate swap contracts to hedge its exposure arising from borrowings carried at floating rates."
- "Swaps currently in place cover majority of the floating-rate borrowing and notes payable principal outstanding."
