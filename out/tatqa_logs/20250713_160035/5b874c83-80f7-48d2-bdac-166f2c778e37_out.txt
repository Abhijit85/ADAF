=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The financial data from 2017 to 2018 shows a decrease in interest expense and total other income, while interest income increased, with significant changes driven by foreign currency translation impacts.

1. Interest expense decreased from $(3343) in 2017 to $(2085) in 2018, a change of $1258, due to lower debt balances and reduced interest from swaps.
2. Interest income increased from $1284 in 2017 to $1826 in 2018, a change of $542, due to higher interest rates.
3. Other (expense) income changed from $3817 in 2017 to $(2676) in 2018, a significant decrease of $6493, driven by foreign currency translation losses.
4. Total other (expense) income, net changed from $1758 in 2017 to $(2935) in 2018, a decrease of $4693, reflecting the impact of foreign currency translation.

Answer Echoes:
- "Interest expense decreased due to lower debt balances and reduced interest from swaps."
- "Interest income increased due to higher interest rates."
- "Other expense in 2018 was driven by foreign currency translation losses."
- "Other income in 2017 was driven by foreign currency translation gains."
