=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The interest expense increased by 3% from 2018 to 2019, primarily due to higher average borrowings from the issuance of senior notes, despite some offset from repayments.

1. Interest expense increased from $2025 million in 2018 to $2082 million in 2019.
2. The percent change in interest expense from 2018 to 2019 is 3%.
3. The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher average borrowings resulting from the issuance of $10.0 billion of senior notes in November 2017.
4. The increase was partially offset by a reduction in interest expense resulting primarily from the maturities and repayments of $2.0 billion of senior notes during fiscal 2019 and $6.0 billion of senior notes during fiscal 2018.
