=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The financial trends from 2017 to 2019 show changes in discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, and compensation increase rates.

1. The discount rate decreased from 3.2% in 2017 to 2.4% in 2018, then slightly increased to 2.5% in 2019.
2. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets decreased from 4.3% in 2017 to 3.3% in 2018 and remained constant at 3.3% in 2019.
3. The rate of compensation increase was stable at 2.3% in 2018 and 2019, with a slight increase from 2.2% in 2017.

Answer Echoes:
- "The discount rate decreased from 3.2% in 2017 to 2.4% in 2018, and then slightly increased to 2.5% in 2019."
- "The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets decreased from 4.3% in 2017 to 3.3% in 2018 and remained constant at 3.3% in 2019."
- "The rate of compensation increase was stable at 2.3% in 2018 and 2019, with a slight increase from 2.2% in 2017."
- "The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return for the plan assets is 3.3%."
- "The assumptions used for the plans are based upon customary rates and practices for the location of the plans."
