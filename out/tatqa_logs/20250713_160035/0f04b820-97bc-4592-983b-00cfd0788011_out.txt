2. Direct energy consumption increased by 6292.13 MWh from 12852.04 MWh in 2018 to 19144.17 MWh in 2019.
3. Indirect energy consumption increased by 31311.65 MWh from 154636.44 MWh in 2018 to 185948.09 MWh in 2019.
4. Running water consumption increased by 310336.67 tonnes from 973413.06 tonnes in 2018 to 1283749.73 tonnes in 2019.
5. Recycled water consumption decreased by 1385 tonnes from 5461 tonnes in 2018 to 4076 tonnes in 2019.
6. Total energy consumption per employee increased from 3.28 MWh per employee in 2018 to 3.44 MWh per employee in 2019.
7. Total energy consumption per floor area decreased from 0.14 MWh per square metre in 2018 to 0.12 MWh per square metre in 2019.
8. Running water consumption per employee increased from 19.07 tonnes per employee in 2018 to 21.52 tonnes per employee in 2019.
