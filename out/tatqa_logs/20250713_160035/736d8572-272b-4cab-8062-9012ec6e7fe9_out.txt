=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The analysis of past due amounts across different risk categories reveals distinct patterns in overdue durations and total amounts, highlighting significant differences in financial risk management.

1. Low-risk countries have the lowest total past due amount at 1912, with the smallest percentage of their total past due in the >360 days category at approximately 16.4% (313/1912).
2. Medium-risk countries have the highest total past due amount at 3035, making up approximately 40.9% of the total past due (3035/7427), and have a relatively high amount past due in the 91–180 days category at 725.
3. High-risk countries have the highest amount past due in the >360 days category with 1315, which is significantly higher than the other categories for the same risk level, and approximately 53.0% of their past due amounts are in this category (1315/2480).

Answer Echoes:
- "The ten largest customers represented 49% of the total trade receivables and contract assets in 2019."
- "Low-risk countries have the lowest total past due amount at 1,912."
- "Medium-risk countries have the highest total past due amount at 3,035."
- "High-risk countries have the highest amount past due in the >360 days category with 1,315."
- "Medium-risk countries have a relatively high amount past due in the 91–180 days category at 725."
