The financial data from 2018 to 2019 shows significant changes in acquisition costs, restructuring charges, and operating income, with notable trends and anomalies impacting the overall financial performance.

1. Acquisition and integration costs increased from $8 million in 2018 to $17 million in 2019, a change of $9 million.
2. Charges associated with the amortization of acquisition-related fair value adjustments decreased from $4 million in 2018 to $0 in 2019.
3. Restructuring and other charges, net, increased significantly from $33 million in 2018 to $144 million in 2019, a change of $111 million.
4. Other items appeared in 2019 with $14 million, whereas it was $0 in 2018.
5. The total increased from $45 million in 2018 to $175 million in 2019, a change of $130 million.
6. Operating income in the Transportation Solutions segment decreased by $352 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to lower volume, unfavorable product mix, and price erosion, partially offset by lower material costs.

Answer Echoes:
- "Operating income in the Transportation Solutions segment decreased $352 million in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018."
