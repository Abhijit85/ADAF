=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The increase in total licenses from 2018 to 2019 was entirely due to a $15.6 million rise in FCC licenses, as state licenses remained unchanged.

1. FCC licenses increased by $15.6 million in 2019, which was the sole contributor to the total increase in licenses, as state licenses remained constant at $2.5 million.
2. The $18.2 million increase in licenses was primarily through acquisitions, offset by $2.3 million of impairments and a $0.3 million loss on the sale of licenses.

Answer Echoes:
- "FCC licenses increased $15.6 million in 2019."

- "Offset by $2.3 million of impairments."
