=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

• The financial activities in 2019 showed significant changes in cash flows, with notable increases in both investing and financing activities, while operating activities saw a decrease.

1. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 5% from $15386 million in 2018 to $14551 million in 2019, primarily due to unfavorable changes in working capital balances associated with income taxes.

2. Net cash provided by (used for) investing activities increased significantly by 572% from $(5625) million in 2018 to $26557 million in 2019, driven by an increase in sales and maturities of marketable securities.

3. Net cash used for financing activities increased by 321% from $(9982) million in 2018 to $(42056) million in 2019, largely due to increased stock repurchases, with $36.1 billion used in 2019 compared to $11.3 billion in 2018.
