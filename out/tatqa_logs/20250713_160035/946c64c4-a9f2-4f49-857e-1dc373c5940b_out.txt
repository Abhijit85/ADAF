=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The data reveals trends in internet, video, and telephony services, highlighting changes in customer net additions and penetration rates from 2018 to 2019.

1. Internet service customers increased by 21189 in 2019 compared to 21417 in 2018, with penetration rising from 49.7% to 50.8%.
2. Video service customers experienced a net loss of 4697 in 2019, an improvement from a larger net loss of 6760 in 2018, but penetration decreased from 37.1% to 35.6%.
3. Telephony service customers saw a significant decrease in net additions from 5594 in 2018 to 489 in 2019, with penetration slightly decreasing from 16.6% to 16.2%.
