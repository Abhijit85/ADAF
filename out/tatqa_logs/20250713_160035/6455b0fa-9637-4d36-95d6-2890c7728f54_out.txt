=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The financial data from 2018 to 2019 shows various trends in service costs, interest costs, expected returns, actuarial gains/losses, foreign exchange impacts, and net periodic pension costs, with a notable absence of curtailment gain in 2019.

1. Service cost decreased from $2262 in 2018 to $1955 in 2019, a reduction of $307.
2. Interest cost increased from $1230 in 2018 to $1308 in 2019, an increase of $78.
3. Expected return on plan assets increased in absolute value from $(787) in 2018 to $(817) in 2019.
4. Recognized net actuarial gain/loss increased from $240 in 2018 to $470 in 2019, an increase of $230.
5. Foreign exchange impacts increased in absolute value from $(56) in 2018 to $(79) in 2019.
6. Recognition of curtailment gain due to plan freeze was $(1236) in 2018 and not present in 2019 or 2017.
7. Net periodic pension cost increased significantly from $1653 in 2018 to $2837 in 2019, an increase of $1184.
