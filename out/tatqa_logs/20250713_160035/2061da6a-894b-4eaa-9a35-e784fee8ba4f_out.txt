=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

â€¢ One-sentence overview: The data reveals trends and calculations related to nonvested shares and performance stock units (PSUs) from 2018 to 2019, highlighting specific grants, vesting achievements, and net changes in shares.

1. The number of nonvested shares increased from 5974 to 6148 from 2018 to 2019, resulting in a net change of 174 shares.
2. The net change in shares is calculated as 3288 (Granted) - 1774 (Released) - 1340 (Canceled) = 174.
3. The weighted-average remaining vesting term as of December 31, 2019, is 1.81 years.
4. In February 2016, 547000 PSUs were granted with financial and operational targets, with participants achieving 80% of the target.
5. As of December 31, 2019, 253203 shares had vested, and 200297 shares had been forfeited.
6. In October 2018, 464888 PSUs were granted with financial targets, eligible to vest at 75% upon achieving performance targets by December 31, 2020.
7. In April 2019, 346453 PSUs were granted with financial targets, with none vested as of December 31, 2019.
8. In December 2019, 375000 PSUs were granted with market performance-based targets, with grant date fair values estimated at $4.59, $4.06, and $3.59.
