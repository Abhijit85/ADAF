=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** All regions experienced a decrease in revenue from 31 March 2018 to 31 March 2019, with EMEA having the largest decline.

1. "All regions experienced a decrease in revenue from 31 March 2018 to 31 March 2019."
2. "Americas: 273.6 - 288.2 = -14.6"
3. "EMEA: 413.0 - 434.2 = -21.2"
4. "APJ: 98.7 - 103.6 = -4.9"
5. "EMEA had the largest decrease in revenue with a change of -21.2."
6. "Total revenue change: 785.3 - 826.0 = -40.7"
