=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The financial data highlights the calculation of total assets, liabilities, and net assets, with a focus on the significant role of goodwill in the acquisition process.

1. Total assets are calculated as $166983, combining current assets, fixed assets, non-current assets, customer relationships, order backlog, core/developed technology, and goodwill.
2. Total liabilities amount to $27727, which includes liabilities, deferred revenue, and deferred tax liability, net.
3. Net assets are determined by subtracting total liabilities from total assets, resulting in $139256.
4. Goodwill, recorded in connection with the acquisition, has the longest estimated useful life, listed as indefinite, and the highest fair value at $93776.
5. The consideration transferred for the acquisition was $107283, net of cash acquired of $31973.
6. Unvested stock options and unvested restricted stock units held by Cloudmark employees were canceled and exchanged, with a fair value of $91 attributed to pre-combination services and $1180 allocated to post-combination services.

Answer Echoes:
- "consideration transferred was $107,283, net of cash acquired of $31,973"
- "unvested stock options and unvested restricted stock units held by Cloudmark employees were canceled and exchanged"
- "fair value of $91 of these unvested awards was attributed to pre-combination services"
- "fair value of $1,180 was allocated to post-combination services"
- "goodwill was recorded in connection with the acquisition"
- "Goodwill has the longest estimated useful life, listed as Indefinite"
- "Goodwill also has the highest fair value at $93,776"
