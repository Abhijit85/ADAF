=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The financial data from 2018 to 2019 shows changes in the gross carrying amounts, accumulated amortization, and net values of various intangible assets, with notable trends in customer relationships and underlying rights.

1. The 'Gross Carrying Amount' for 'Customer relationships' remained almost constant, increasing slightly from $1597.0 in 2018 to $1597.6 in 2019.
2. 'Accumulated Amortization' for 'Customer relationships' increased significantly from $(405.6) in 2018 to $(498.7) in 2019.
3. The 'Net' value for 'Customer relationships' decreased from $1191.4 in 2018 to $1098.9 in 2019.
4. 'Underlying rights and other' (finite-lived) saw a slight increase in 'Gross Carrying Amount' from $2.7 in 2018 to $3.4 in 2019.
5. 'Accumulated Amortization' for 'Underlying rights and other' (finite-lived) increased from $(0.6) in 2018 to $(1.5) in 2019.
6. The 'Net' value for 'Underlying rights and other' (finite-lived) decreased slightly from $2.1 in 2018 to $1.9 in 2019.
7. 'Certifications' and 'Underlying rights and other' (indefinite-lived) had no change in 'Gross Carrying Amount' and 'Net' values between 2018 and 2019.
8. Overall, the total 'Net' for finite-lived intangible assets decreased from $1193.5 in 2018 to $1100.8 in 2019.
9. The total 'Net' for indefinite-lived intangible assets decreased from $1212.1 in 2018 to $1118.8 in 2019.

Answer Echoes:
- "The weighted average remaining amortization period for the Company’s customer relationships asset is 14.3 years."
- "The amortization period for underlying rights (including easements) is 13.0 years."
- "The amortization of intangible assets for the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $95.1 million, $97.2 million, and $80.0 million, respectively."
- "'Gross Carrying Amount' for 'Customer relationships' remained almost constant: $1,597.0 in 2018 → $1,597.6 in 2019."
- "'Accumulated Amortization' for 'Customer relationships' increased significantly from $(405.6) in 2018 to $(498.7) in 2019."
- "Overall, the total 'Net' for finite-lived intangible assets decreased from $1,193.5 in 2018 to $1,100.8 in 2019."
