=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

• One-sentence overview: The restructuring efforts led to significant decreases in employee and facility termination costs, with high payments being a major factor in these reductions.

1. Employee termination costs decreased significantly from $53.0 to $2.0, primarily due to high payments of $(89.7).
2. Facility terminations and other exit costs decreased from $2.5 to $0.1, with payments of $(5.7) exceeding additions.
3. Total costs decreased from $55.5 to $2.1, with payments of $(95.4) being the largest factor.
4. Despite high payments, adjustments for employee terminations and facility costs were minimal at $(0.5) and 0.1, respectively.
5. The current portion remained consistent at $55.5 initially and $2.1 finally, matching the total balance changes.
