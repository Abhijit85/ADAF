=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The data from 2017 to 2019 shows trends in financial metrics, including a decrease in expected life and increases in risk-free interest rate, volatility, dividend yield, and weighted-average fair value per share.

1. The expected life (in years) decreased from 4.8 in 2017 to 4.6 in 2019.
2. The risk-free interest rate increased from 1.0% in 2017 to 2.7% in 2019.
3. Volatility increased from 23% in 2017 to 24% in 2019.
4. The dividend yield increased from 1.5% in 2017 to 1.7% in 2019.
5. The weighted-average fair value per share increased from $8.18 in 2017 to $10.77 in 2019.

Answer Echoes:
- "Expected life (in years) decreased from 4.8 in 2017 to 4.6 in 2019."
- "Risk-free interest rate increased from 1.0% in 2017 to 2.7% in 2019."
- "Volatility increased from 23% in 2017 to 24% in 2019."
- "Dividend yield increased from 1.5% in 2017 to 1.7% in 2019."
- "Weighted-average fair value per share increased from $8.18 in 2017 to $10.77 in 2019."
- "PSOs granted during fiscal 2018 estimated at approximately $10 per share using a Monte Carlo simulation approach."
- "Monte Carlo simulation assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 2.14%, expected term of seven years, expected volatility of 22.44%, dividend yield of 1.49%."
