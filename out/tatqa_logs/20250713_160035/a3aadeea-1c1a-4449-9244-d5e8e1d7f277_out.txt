=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

• The financial data from 2017 to 2019 shows various trends and anomalies in benefit obligations, service costs, interest costs, actuarial gains/losses, and benefits paid.

1. The benefit obligation increased from $11594 million in 2018 to $12217 million in 2019, marking a change of $623 million.
2. The service cost decreased from $66 million in 2018 to $56 million in 2019.
3. The interest cost increased from $392 million in 2018 to $436 million in 2019.
4. A significant actuarial loss of $1249 million occurred in 2019 compared to an actuarial gain of $765 million in 2018.
5. Benefits paid from plan assets consistently decreased over the years: $1238 million in 2017, $1178 million in 2018, and $1115 million in 2019.
6. A special termination benefits charge of $15 million in 2018 was notably higher than the $6 million in 2019.
7. The ratio of benefits paid to the beginning benefit obligation was approximately 9.6% in 2019 ($1115 million / $11594 million).

Answer Echoes:
- "Adopted revised mortality tables decreased projected benefit obligation by $4 million in 2019."
- "Adopted revised mortality tables decreased projected benefit obligation by $38 million in 2018."
- "Adopted revised mortality tables decreased projected benefit obligation by $113 million in 2017."
- "Amortization period for net actuarial (gain) loss is approximately 16 years as of December 31, 2019."
