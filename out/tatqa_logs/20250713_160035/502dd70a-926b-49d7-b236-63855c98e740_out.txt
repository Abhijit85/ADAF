=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The data shows a consistent decrease in emissions from FY18 to FY19, with significant contributions from a green tariff and improved emissions efficiency relative to sales.

1. Total gross emissions decreased from 143354 tonnes in FY18*** to 98725 tonnes in FY18, and further to 87128 tonnes in FY19.
2. A green tariff of -27603 tonnes was applied in FY19, significantly reducing the total net emissions.
3. The ratio of KgCO2e per £1 sales revenue decreased from 0.066 in FY18 to 0.060 in FY19, indicating improved emissions efficiency.
4. Scope 1 emissions decreased consistently from 75600 tonnes in FY18*** to 66336 tonnes in FY18, and further to 59495 tonnes in FY19.
5. Scope 2 emissions showed a decreasing trend from FY18*** to FY19, with exceptionally high emissions of 67754 tonnes in FY18*** compared to 32389 tonnes in FY18 and 27633 tonnes in FY19.

Answer Echoes:
- "Total gross emissions decreased from 143,354 tonnes in FY18*** to 98,725 tonnes in FY18, and further to 87,128 tonnes in FY19."
- "A green tariff of -27,603 tonnes was applied in FY19, reducing the total net emissions significantly."
- "The ratio of KgCO2e per £1 sales revenue decreased from 0.066 in FY18 to 0.060 in FY19."
- "Scope 1 emissions decreased consistently from 75,600 tonnes in FY18*** to 66,336 tonnes in FY18, and further to 59,495 tonnes in FY19."
- "Reduction in emissions is driven by continued progress in energy efficiency."
- "Reduction in emissions associated with refrigerants as we continue to move away from fluorinated gas refrigerants."
- "Adoption of a certified green tariff renewable electricity supply contract for UK operations."
- "15% reduction in water consumption per tonne of product over six years."
- "Closure of the Evercreech desserts facility contributed to improvement in water consumption."
