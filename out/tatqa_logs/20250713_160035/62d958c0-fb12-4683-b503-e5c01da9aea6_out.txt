=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The financial performance from 2017 to 2019 showed fluctuations in operating income, net income from continuing operations, and diluted earnings per share, with improvements noted in 2019 compared to 2018.

1. Operating income (loss) decreased from $5737 in 2017 to $(6986) in 2018, a change of Δ = $(12723), but improved from $(6986) in 2018 to $(2235) in 2019, a change of Δ = $4751.
2. Net income (loss) from continuing operations decreased from $3208 in 2017 to $(5146) in 2018, a change of Δ = $(8354), and improved from $(5146) in 2018 to $(2351) in 2019, a change of Δ = $2795.
3. Diluted earnings per share decreased from $0.12 in 2017 to $(0.19) in 2018, a change of Δ = $(0.31), and improved from $(0.19) in 2018 to $(0.08) in 2019, a change of Δ = $0.11.

Answer Echoes:
- "Operating income (loss) decreased from $5,737 in 2017 to $(6,986) in 2018, a change of Δ = $(12,723)."
- "Operating income (loss) improved from $(6,986) in 2018 to $(2,235) in 2019, a change of Δ = $4,751."
- "Net income (loss) from continuing operations decreased from $3,208 in 2017 to $(5,146) in 2018, a change of Δ = $(8,354)."
- "Net income (loss) from continuing operations improved from $(5,146) in 2018 to $(2,351) in 2019, a change of Δ = $2,795."
- "Diluted earnings per share decreased from $0.12 in 2017 to $(0.19) in 2018, a change of Δ = $(0.31)."
- "Diluted earnings per share improved from $(0.19) in 2018 to $(0.08) in 2019, a change of Δ = $0.11."
- "Products and services provided under long-term, fixed-price contracts represented approximately 97% of our sales for 2019."
- "If underlying assumptions were to change such that our estimated profit rate at completion for all fixed-price contracts accounted for under the cost-to-cost percentage-of-completion method was higher or lower by one percentage point, our 2019 operating income would have increased or decreased by approximately $6.5 million."
