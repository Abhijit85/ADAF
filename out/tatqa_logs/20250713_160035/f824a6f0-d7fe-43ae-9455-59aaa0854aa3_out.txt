=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The financial trends from 2017 to 2019 show a decrease in gains recognized in other comprehensive income, an increase in gains reclassified into revenue, and an improvement in losses recognized in other income.

1. Gains recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, decreased from $219 million in 2018 to $159 million in 2019, a change of Δ = -$60 million.
2. Gains reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into revenue increased from $185 million in 2018 to $341 million in 2019, a change of Δ = +$156 million.
3. Losses recognized in other income (expense), net improved from $(255) million in 2018 to $(64) million in 2019, a change of Δ = +$191 million.

Answer Echoes:
- "No net derivative gains included in AOCI as of June 30, 2019"
- "No significant amounts of gains (losses) reclassified from AOCI into earnings due to failed forecasted transactions in fiscal year 2019"
- "Gains recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax decreased from $219 million in 2018 to $159 million in 2019"
- "Gains reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into revenue increased from $185 million in 2018 to $341 million in 2019"
- "Losses recognized in other income (expense), net improved from $(255) million in 2018 to $(64) million in 2019"
