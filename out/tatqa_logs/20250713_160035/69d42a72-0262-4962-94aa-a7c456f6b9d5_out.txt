=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The financial data from 2018 to 2019 shows significant changes in interest income, interest expense, foreign exchange expense, and total other income (expense), with notable anomalies in percentage changes.

1. Interest income increased by $1205 from $1310 in 2018 to $2515 in 2019, primarily due to higher weighted-average balances of cash, cash equivalents, and investments, as well as higher yields on investments.
2. Interest expense increased dramatically by $5342 from $598 in 2018 to $5940 in 2019, mainly due to $3.3 million associated with long-term debt and $2.0 million from a financing lease obligation.
3. Foreign exchange expense and other, net, decreased by $3083 from $3439 in 2018 to $356 in 2019, primarily due to a $1.9 million decrease in foreign exchange expense, $0.9 million in sublease income, and a $0.3 million gain related to the Solebit acquisition.
4. Total other income (expense), net, decreased by $1054 from $(2727) in 2018 to $(3781) in 2019, marked as 'nm' due to the large percentage change.

Answer Echoes:
- "Interest income increased $1.2 million primarily as a result of higher weighted-average balances of cash, cash equivalents and investments and higher yields on investments."
- "Interest expense increased $5.3 million primarily as a result of interest expense of $3.3 million associated with our long-term debt and our financing lease obligation of $2.0 million."
- "Foreign exchange expense and other, net decreased by $3.1 million primarily as a result of a decrease in foreign exchange expense of $1.9 million, sublease income of $0.9 million and a gain on a previously held asset related to the Solebit acquisition of $0.3 million."
