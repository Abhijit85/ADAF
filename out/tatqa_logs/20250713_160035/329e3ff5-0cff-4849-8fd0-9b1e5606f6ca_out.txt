=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The asset changes from 2018 to 2019 show growth in Transportation and Industrial Solutions, a decline in Communications Solutions, and a significant decrease in Other current assets.

1. Transportation Solutions assets increased from $4707 million in 2018 to $4781 million in 2019, reflecting a growth of $74 million.
2. Industrial Solutions assets grew from $2049 million in 2018 to $2100 million in 2019, marking an increase of $51 million.
3. Communications Solutions assets decreased from $959 million in 2018 to $849 million in 2019, showing a decline of $110 million.
4. Total segment assets increased slightly from $7715 million in 2018 to $7730 million in 2019, a growth of $15 million.
5. Other current assets saw a significant decrease from $1981 million in 2018 to $1398 million in 2019, a decline of $583 million.
6. Other non-current assets decreased slightly from $10690 million in 2018 to $10566 million in 2019, a decline of $124 million.
7. Total segment assets constituted a smaller portion of total assets in 2019 ($7730 million out of $19694 million) compared to 2018 ($7715 million out of $20386 million).
