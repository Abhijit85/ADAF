=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The financial data from 2017 to 2019 shows a consistent increase in trade accounts receivable sold, cash proceeds received, and pre-tax losses on the sale of receivables, with a stable ratio of cash proceeds to trade accounts receivable sold, but a disproportionately larger increase in pre-tax losses.

1. "Trade accounts receivable sold increased from $2968 in 2017 to $5480 in 2018 and further to $6751 in 2019."
2. "Cash proceeds received increased from $2962 in 2017 to $5463 in 2018 and further to $6723 in 2019."
3. "Pre-tax losses on sale of receivables increased from $6 in 2017 to $17 in 2018 and further to $28 in 2019."
4. "The ratio of Cash proceeds received to Trade accounts receivable sold remained relatively stable: 2017 (0.998), 2018 (0.997), 2019 (0.996)."
5. "The increase in Pre-tax losses on sale of receivables is proportionally larger compared to the increase in Trade accounts receivable sold and Cash proceeds received."
