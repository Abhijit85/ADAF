=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The cash and cash equivalents consistently decreased each year from 2017 to 2019, with significant net decreases in 2017 and 2019, and a minimal decrease in 2018, while the effect of foreign exchange rate changes was negligible in 2019 and 2018, but slightly negative in 2017.

1. Cash and cash equivalents decreased each year: 2019 (428.6 → 901.3), 2018 (901.3 → 908.7), 2017 (908.7 → 2092.7).
2. The net decrease in cash and cash equivalents was significant in 2019 (-472.7) and 2017 (-1184.0), but minimal in 2018 (-7.4).
3. The effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents was negligible in 2019 and 2018 (0), but slightly negative in 2017 (-1.0).
4. The beginning cash and cash equivalents decreased each year: 2019 (901.3), 2018 (908.7), 2017 (2092.7).
