=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The financial data from 2017 to 2019 shows a decrease in total balance payable and workforce reduction costs, alongside a shift in facility cost management and cost structure.

1. The total balance payable decreased from $11414 in 2017 to $5021 in 2018, and further to $3995 in 2019.
2. Workforce reduction costs saw a significant decrease in cash payments from $(12342) in 2017 to $(213) in 2018.
3. Facility costs increased in accruals and adjustments from $3775 in 2017 to $1152 in 2018, indicating a shift in cost management.
4. The proportion of facility costs in the total balance payable increased from 2017 to 2019, indicating a shift in cost structure.
5. Foreign exchange and other non-cash adjustments for workforce reduction were positive in 2017 ($455) but turned negative in 2018 ($(77)).
