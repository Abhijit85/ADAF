=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The financial data from 2017 to 2019 shows significant fluctuations in research and development funding, phase-out and start-up costs, and other income and expenses, with notable increases in 2019.

1. Research and development funding increased significantly from $52 million in 2018 to $132 million in 2019, marking an $80 million rise.
2. Phase-out and start-up costs saw a substantial increase from $(1) million in 2018 to $(38) million in 2019, a $37 million rise in costs.
3. Other income and expenses, net, increased from $53 million in 2018 to $103 million in 2019, an increase of $50 million, mainly due to grants from the European Commission IPCEI, despite higher start-up costs.
4. As a percentage of net revenues, the figure increased from 0.5% in 2018 to 1.1% in 2019.

Answer Echoes:
- "In 2019 we recognized other income, net of expenses, of $103 million"
- "mainly benefitting from the grants associated with the programs part of the European Commission IPCEI"
- "partially offset by a higher level of start-up costs associated with the production ramp up"
- "In 2018 we recognized other income, net of expenses, of $53 million"
- "mainly due to lower level of R&D grants"
