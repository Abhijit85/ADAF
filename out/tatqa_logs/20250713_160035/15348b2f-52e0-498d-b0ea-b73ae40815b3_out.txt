=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The financial trends from 2017 to 2020 show significant changes in net cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, with notable increases in operating and investing cash flows and a consistent use of cash in financing activities.

1. **Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities:** The net cash provided by operating activities increased by $242 million from 2017 to 2018, and by $224 million from 2018 to 2019, primarily due to favorable working capital changes, higher advance payments from customers, and lower payments for taxes, integration, and restructuring costs.

2. **Net Cash Provided by Investing Activities:** The net cash provided by investing activities turned positive, increasing by $179 million from 2018 to 2019, driven by proceeds from the dispositions of commercial cybersecurity and health staff augmentation businesses and the sale of real estate properties.

3. **Net Cash Used in Financing Activities:** The net cash used in financing activities increased by $278 million from 2017 to 2018 and by $2 million from 2018 to 2019, mainly due to the timing of debt payments and higher stock repurchases.

4. **Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash:** There was a net decrease of $(53) million in 2018, contrasting with a net increase of $26 million in 2017 and $348 million in 2020, highlighting an anomaly in cash flow trends.
