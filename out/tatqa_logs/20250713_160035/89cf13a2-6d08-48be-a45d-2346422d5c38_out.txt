=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The data shows trends in expected volatility, risk-free interest rates, expected term, weighted-average fair value, and dividend yield from 2018 to 2020.

1. Expected volatility decreased from 33.5% in 2019 to 27.4% in 2020, following an increase from 22.6% in 2018.
2. The risk-free interest rate decreased from 2.0% in 2019 to 1.7% in 2020, after an increase from 1.2% in 2018.
3. The expected term (in years) decreased from 0.8 in 2019 to 0.6 in 2020, following a decrease from 0.9 in 2018.
4. The weighted-average fair value at grant date increased from $34.72 in 2019 to $35.66 in 2020, after an increase from $21.93 in 2018.
5. The dividend yield is consistently 'None' across all years, indicating no dividends were expected or paid.

Answer Echoes:
- "Expected volatility decreased from 33.5% in 2019 to 27.4% in 2020"
- "Risk-free interest rate decreased from 2.0% in 2019 to 1.7% in 2020"
- "Expected term (in years) decreased from 0.8 in 2019 to 0.6 in 2020"
- "Weighted-average fair value at grant date increased from $34.72 in 2019 to $35.66 in 2020"
- "Dividend yield is consistently 'None' across all years"
- "Volatility was based on an analysis of historical stock prices and implied volatilities"
- "Risk-free interest rate was based on a U.S. Treasury instrument"
- "Expected dividend yield input was zero as the Company has not historically paid, nor expects in the future to pay, regular dividends"
