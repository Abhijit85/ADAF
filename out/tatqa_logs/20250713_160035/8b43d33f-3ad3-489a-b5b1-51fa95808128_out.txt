2. U.S. government obligations Amortized Cost increased slightly from $97223 in 2018 to $99700 in 2019.
3. Foreign government obligations Unrealized Gains dropped from $14234 in 2018 to $0 in 2019.
4. U.S. government obligations Unrealized Gains decreased from $416 in 2018 to $0 in 2019.
5. Foreign government obligations Unrealized Losses increased from $235 in 2018 to $3433 in 2019.
6. U.S. government obligations Unrealized Losses decreased from $6436 in 2018 to $1981 in 2019.
7. Total Amortized Cost increased from $171021 in 2018 to $229199 in 2019.
8. Total Unrealized Losses decreased from $6671 in 2018 to $5414 in 2019.
9. Total Fair Value increased from $179000 in 2018 to $223785 in 2019.
10. As of December 31, 2019, there were no restricted investments in a loss position for more than 12 months, compared to six restricted investments totaling $87.4 million in 2018 with unrealized losses of $6.4 million.

Answer Echoes:
- "As of December 31, 2019, we had no restricted investments in a loss position for a period of time greater than 12 months."
- "As of December 31, 2018, we identified six restricted investments totaling $87.4 million that had been in a loss position for a period of time greater than 12 months with unrealized losses of $6.4 million."
- "The unrealized losses were primarily due to increases in interest rates relative to rates at the time of purchase."
- "Based on the underlying credit quality of the investments, we generally hold such securities until we recover our cost basis."
- "Therefore, we did not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired."
