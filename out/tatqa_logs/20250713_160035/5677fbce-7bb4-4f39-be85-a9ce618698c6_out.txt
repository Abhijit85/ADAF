=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The financial performance of SGRE in 2019 showed growth in orders and revenue, but a slight decrease in adjusted EBITA and its margin, indicating potential cost challenges despite increased business volume.

1. Orders increased by 874 million €, from 11875 million € in 2018 to 12749 million € in 2019, driven by large orders in Asia and the Americas.
2. Revenue rose by 1105 million €, from 9122 million € in 2018 to 10227 million € in 2019, with significant growth in offshore and service businesses.
3. Adjusted EBITA slightly decreased by 1 million €, from 483 million € in 2018 to 482 million € in 2019, despite revenue growth.
4. The adjusted EBITA margin decreased from 5.3% in 2018 to 4.7% in 2019, suggesting increased costs or inefficiencies.
5. Severance charges were reduced from 77 million € in 2018 to 32 million € in 2019, indicating a decrease in restructuring costs.
