=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** In fiscal 2019, CMS experienced significant financial improvements, including a 59% increase in sales, a shift from an operating loss to a profit, and a 31% rise in Adjusted EBITDA, driven by increased product deliveries and higher sales in key product lines.

1. CMS sales increased by 59% to $328.8 million in fiscal 2019 compared to $207.0 million in 2018, primarily due to increased product deliveries across all CMS product lines.
2. Operating income improved from a loss of $0.1 million in 2018 to a profit of $7.8 million in 2019, mainly due to higher sales from expeditionary satellite communications products and secure networks products.
3. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 31% to $34.4 million in 2019 compared to $26.2 million in 2018, driven by the same factors that improved operating income.
