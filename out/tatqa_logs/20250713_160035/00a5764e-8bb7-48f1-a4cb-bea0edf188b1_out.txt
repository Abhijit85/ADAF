=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The financial metrics from 2017 to 2019 show a general trend of slight decreases in dividend yield, expected volatility, and the expected life of the option term, while the risk-free interest rate remained constant.

1. The 'Dividend yield' decreased from 4.6% in 2018 to 4.5% in 2019, after increasing from 4.1% in 2017 to 4.6% in 2018.
2. The 'Expected volatility' decreased from 28.7% in 2018 to 28.3% in 2019, following an increase from 27.1% in 2017 to 28.7% in 2018.
3. The 'Risk-free interest rate' remained constant at 2.5% from 2018 to 2019, after increasing from 2.0% in 2017 to 2.5% in 2018.
4. The 'Expected life of the option term' decreased consistently from 4.5 years in 2017 to 4.4 years in 2018, and further to 4.3 years in 2019.
