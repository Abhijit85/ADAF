2. Non-Swiss revenue increased from $53445 in 2017 to $54330 in 2018 (Δ = $885) and to $58147 in 2019 (Δ = $3817), showing a smaller growth compared to Swiss revenue.
3. Income before taxes increased from $214989 in 2017 to $232265 in 2018 (Δ = $17276) and to $271133 in 2019 (Δ = $38868), with the increase from 2018 to 2019 being more than double the increase from 2017 to 2018.
