=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The financial data shows significant changes in net income, shares used in computations, and net income per share from 2017 to 2019.

1. Net income increased significantly from $116 in 2018 to $1169 in 2019, a change of $1053.
2. Shares used in basic computation decreased from 268 in 2018 to 254 in 2019, a change of -14.
3. Basic Net Income per Share increased from $0.43 in 2018 to $4.60 in 2019, a change of $4.17.

Answer Echoes:
- "Potential shares from outstanding employee equity awards totaling 1 million for 2019 and 2018."
- "Potential shares from outstanding employee equity awards totaling 6 million for 2017."
- "Potential shares were excluded from diluted net income per share calculations as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive."
- "Net income increased significantly from $116 in 2018 to $1,169 in 2019."
- "Shares used in basic computation decreased from 268 in 2018 to 254 in 2019."
- "Basic Net Income per Share increased from $0.43 in 2018 to $4.60 in 2019."
