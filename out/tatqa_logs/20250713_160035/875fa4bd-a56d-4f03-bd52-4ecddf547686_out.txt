=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The financial data reveals significant fluctuations in realized and unrealized gains and losses on cross currency swaps from 2017 to 2019, with notable changes in realized gains (losses) on maturity and/or partial termination, realized losses, and unrealized (losses) gains.

1. "Realized gains (losses) on maturity and/or partial termination of cross currency swap" changed from (25733) in 2017 to (42271) in 2018, then to 0 in 2019.
2. "Realized losses" decreased from (18494) in 2017 to (6533) in 2018 and further to (5062) in 2019.
3. "Unrealized (losses) gains" shifted from a gain of 82668 in 2017 to a loss of (13239) in 2019, with a gain of 21240 in 2018.
4. "Total realized and unrealized (losses) gains on cross currency swaps" shows a large gain of 38441 in 2017, turning into losses of (27564) in 2018 and (18301) in 2019.

Answer Echoes:
- "Realized gains (losses) on maturity and/or partial termination of cross currency swap" changed from (25,733) in 2017 to (42,271) in 2018, then to 0 in 2019.
- "Realized losses" decreased from (18,494) in 2017 to (6,533) in 2018 and further to (5,062) in 2019.

- "Total realized and unrealized (losses) gains on cross currency swaps" shows a large gain of 38,441 in 2017, turning into losses of (27,564) in 2018 and (18,301) in 2019.
- The company minimizes counterparty risk by using counterparties rated "A- or better by Standard & Poor’s or A3 or better by Moody’s".
- Interest rate swaps are entered into with "different counterparties to reduce concentration risk".
