=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** From 2017 to 2019, there were notable fluctuations in cost of sales, gross profit, and gross margin, reflecting changes in profitability and cost management.

1. Cost of sales increased by 1.0% from 2018 to 2019, indicating a slight rise in costs.
2. Cost of sales decreased by 14.3% from 2017 to 2018, showing a significant reduction in costs during that period.
3. Gross profit decreased by 4.3% from 2018 to 2019, suggesting a decline in profitability.
4. Gross profit increased by 18.0% from 2017 to 2018, indicating a strong improvement in profitability.
5. Gross margin decreased by 130 basis points from 2018 to 2019, reflecting a decrease in profitability relative to net revenues.
6. Gross margin increased by 80 basis points from 2017 to 2018, showing an improvement in profitability relative to net revenues.

Answer Echoes:
- "In 2019, gross margin decreased by 130 basis points to 38.7% from 40.0% in the full year 2018."
- "Unused capacity charges in 2019 were $65 million, impacting full year gross margin by 70 basis points."
- "In 2018, gross margin improved by 80 basis points to 40.0% from 39.2% in the full year 2017."
- "In 2018 unused capacity charges were negligible."
- "Gross profit decreased by 4.3% from 2018 to 2019."
- "Gross profit increased by 18.0% from 2017 to 2018."
