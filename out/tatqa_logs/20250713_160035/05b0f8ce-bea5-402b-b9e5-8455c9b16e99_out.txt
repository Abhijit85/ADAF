=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The data shows significant increases in the number of shares purchased and the average price paid per share over three periods, alongside a decrease in the remaining dollar value available for share repurchase.

1. The total number of shares purchased increased significantly from 262 in the first period to 3380 in the second period, and then to 3608 in the third period.
2. The average price paid per share increased from $64.77 in the first period to $65.53 in the second period, and further to $72.49 in the third period.
3. The total number of shares purchased as part of the publicly announced program increased from 306255 in the first period to 309635 in the second period, and to 313244 in the third period.
4. The approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the repurchase program decreased from $2372 million in the first period to $2150 million in the second period, and further to $1889 million in the third period.
