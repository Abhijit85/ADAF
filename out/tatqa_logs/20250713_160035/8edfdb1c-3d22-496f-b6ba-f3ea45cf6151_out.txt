=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The fiscal year ending March 31, 2019, saw a significant increase in total net sales, driven by growth in Ceramic Components and Interconnect, Sensing and Control Devices, despite a decline in Advanced Components.

1. Total net sales increased from $1562474 to $1791790, marking a change of $229316.
2. Ceramic Components experienced the largest percentage increase, rising approximately 86.5% from $226204 to $421849.
3. Tantalum Components saw a modest increase from $366194 to $382905, a change of $16711.
4. Advanced Components was the only category with a negative change, decreasing by $157567 from $642775 to $485208, approximately 24.5%.
5. Interconnect, Sensing and Control Devices sales increased from $327301 to $501828, a change of $174527.
6. Electronic Component sales rose from $1235.2 million to $1290.0 million, driven by increased volume and favorable pricing.
7. Sales to independent electronic distributors represented 42.3% of total net sales in 2019, slightly down from 42.7% in 2018.
8. Regional sales decreased in Asia but increased in Europe and America.
9. Gross profit increased from $318.9 million to $482.9 million.
