=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

• One-sentence overview: The financial trends indicate significant increases in net financing costs and financing costs, primarily due to mark-to-market losses and adverse foreign exchange rate movements, while investment income and interest income on tax settlements decreased.

1. Investment income decreased from 685 to 433, a change of Δ = -252.
2. Financing costs increased significantly from (1074) to (2088), a change of Δ = -1014.
3. Net financing costs increased from (389) to (1655), a change of Δ = -1266.
4. Net financing costs before interest on settlement of tax issues increased from (749) to (1043), a change of Δ = -294.
5. Interest income arising on settlement of outstanding tax issues decreased from 11 to 1, a change of Δ = -10.
6. Mark to market (losses)/gains decreased from 27 to (423), a change of Δ = -450.
7. Foreign exchange (losses)/gains decreased from 322 to (190), a change of Δ = -512.

Answer Echoes:
- "Net financing costs increased by €1.3 billion, primarily driven by mark-to-market losses and adverse foreign exchange rate movements."
- "Increased interest costs as part of the financing for the Liberty Global transaction."
- "Adverse interest rate movements on borrowings in foreign operations."
- "Underlying financing costs remained stable, reflecting consistent average net debt balances and weighted average borrowing costs."
