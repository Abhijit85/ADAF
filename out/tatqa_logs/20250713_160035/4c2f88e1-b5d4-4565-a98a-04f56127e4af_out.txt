=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The financial data from 2017 to 2019 shows a decrease in balance, significant tax-related adjustments, and a stable end-of-period balance, with expectations of further reductions in tax contingencies in 2020.

1. The balance decreased from $15990 in 2017 to $13162 in 2018, and further to $13009 in 2019.
2. In 2019, there was a significant reduction of $4295 based on tax positions taken during a prior period.
3. In 2019, there were substantial additions of $4479 based on tax positions taken during a prior period - acquisitions.
4. The reductions related to a lapse of applicable statute of limitations decreased from $3144 in 2018 to $821 in 2019.
5. The balance at the end of the period remained relatively stable between 2018 ($13162) and 2019 ($13009).
6. The net change in balance from 2018 to 2019 was a decrease of $153.
7. The unrecognized tax benefits of $13.0 million, if recognized, will impact the Company’s effective tax rate.
8. We had $3.0 million and $1.2 million of accrued interest and penalties at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
9. We expect the total amount of tax contingencies will decrease by approximately $3.5 million in 2020 based on statute of limitation expiration.
