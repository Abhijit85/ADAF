=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**One-sentence overview:** The financial data reveals expected credit losses across various categories, with provisions closely matching these expectations, and highlights significant revenue from data center services.

1. The expected loss for the 'Current' category is $237620, which is 1% of $23762000, and is close to the provision of $238000.
2. The expected loss for '0 to 30 days past due' is $103400, which is 5% of $2068000, matching the provision of $103000.
3. The expected loss for '31 to 60 days past due' is $59025, which is 7.5% of $787000, close to the provision of $59000.
4. The expected loss for 'More than 60 days past due' is $340600, which is 20% of $1703000, close to the provision of $341000.
5. The total loss allowance provision of $741000 matches the sum of individual provisions.
6. Net receivables total $27579000, confirming the sum of individual net receivables.
7. Revenues from data center services amounted to $61.2 million, derived from two customers.
