=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of unrecognized tax benefits from 2017 to 2019 reveals significant fluctuations in tax positions and related financial impacts. 

1. The balance of unrecognized tax benefits decreased over three years, from $15990 in 2017 to $13009 in 2019, indicating a trend of reducing tax liabilities.
2. There was a notable anomaly in 2019 with additions based on tax positions during a prior period acquisitions increasing significantly to 4479 from 757 in 2018, suggesting a substantial change in tax strategy or acquisitions.
3. Reductions based on tax positions during a prior period were unusually high in 2019 at (4295), compared to (153) in 2018, highlighting a significant adjustment in tax liabilities.
4. The accrued interest and penalties rose to $3.0 million in 2019 from $1.2 million in 2018, reflecting increased financial obligations related to tax positions.
