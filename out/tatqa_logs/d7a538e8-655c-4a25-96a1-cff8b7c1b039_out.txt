=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of inventory trends reveals significant shifts in the composition and valuation of inventory components over the period.

1. Finished goods inventory saw a notable decrease of $1548, dropping from 10995 to 9447, indicating a potential reduction in unsold stock or increased sales activity.
2. Work-in-process inventory increased by $2825, from 12129 to 14954, suggesting a rise in production activity or delays in completing goods.
3. Raw materials inventory decreased by $2383, from 25746 to 23363, which may reflect improved efficiency in material usage or a strategic reduction in stockpiling.
4. Inventory reserves increased by $143, from 5384 to 5527, and as a percentage of total inventory components, rose from 8.3% in 2018 to 8.7% in 2019, indicating a cautious approach to potential inventory obsolescence or valuation adjustments.
