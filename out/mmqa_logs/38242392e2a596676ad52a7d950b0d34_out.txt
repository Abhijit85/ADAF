=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The analysis synthesizes responses from cross-modal agents to determine the most accurate answer to a given question, following a structured decision-making process.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses provided the same answer with clear and robust reasoning, indicating a consensus. This consistency suggests reliability in the information presented, making it the preferred choice.

2. **Fallback Rule:** In cases where two responses indicated insufficient information, the third response offered a concrete answer with detailed evidence. This response was considered due to its specificity and the strength of its supporting data.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** When all three responses differed, the decision was based on the quality of reasoning. The response with the clearest, most coherent, and in-depth explanation was selected, ensuring that the final answer was well-supported.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was chosen based on the strongest rationale, ensuring transparency and logical consistency. This approach ensures that the decision directly addresses the original question with the most reliable information available.
