=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In synthesizing the responses from cross-modal synthesis agents, the final answer is determined by evaluating consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check**: Two responses provided the same answer with clear and robust reasoning, indicating a consensus. This consistency suggests reliability in the conclusion drawn from the evidence.

2. **Fallback Rule**: Although one response offered a concrete answer with detailed evidence, the consistency of the other two responses takes precedence, as they align with the rules for selecting the final answer.

3. **Conflict Resolution**: There was no need for conflict resolution as the consistent responses were already identified, and they provided coherent and well-supported reasoning.

4. **Final Synthesis**: The final answer is selected based on the consistent responses, which demonstrated clear reasoning and robust evidence. This approach ensures that the decision is transparent, logically consistent, and directly addresses the original question, adhering to the established rules for synthesis.
