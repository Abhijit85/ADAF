=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

3. **Academic Influence:** Plantinga's academic tenure at Calvin College and the University of Notre Dame provided a platform for his ideas to gain traction and influence subsequent philosophical discourse.

4. **Evolving Views:** Although Plantinga later revised his views on the ontological argument and epistemic rationality, the initial impact of "God and Other Minds" remains a pivotal moment in the philosophy of religion.
