=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 led to the emergence of 15 independent post-Soviet states, each navigating its path in the new geopolitical landscape.

1. **Independence and Continuity**: The Baltic states—Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania—asserted their pre-1940 independence, distinguishing themselves from other former Soviet republics. They prioritized integration with Western institutions like the EU and NATO over joining the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) or the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO).

2. **Russia's Role**: As the recognized successor state of the Soviet Union, Russia retained significant influence in the region, both politically and economically, often seeking to maintain ties with other former Soviet republics through organizations like the CIS.

3. **Diverse Alliances**: Not all former Soviet republics joined the CIS or CSTO, reflecting diverse political and strategic priorities. For instance, while some Central Asian states maintained close ties with Russia, others pursued more independent foreign policies.

4. **Historical Context**: The information is grounded in the historical events of 1990-1991, highlighting the complex interplay of independence movements and geopolitical realignments following the USSR's collapse.
