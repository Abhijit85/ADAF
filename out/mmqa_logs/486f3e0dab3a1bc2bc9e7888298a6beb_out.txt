=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

BBN Technologies, a prominent research and development service provider and military contractor based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, developed the HSLS wireless mesh network routing protocol.

1. **HSLS Protocol**: HSLS, developed by BBN Technologies, is a wireless mesh network routing protocol that uniquely combines proactive and reactive link-state routing to optimize network overhead, making it efficient for dynamic and scalable network environments.

2. **Location and Influence**: BBN Technologies is located near Fresh Pond in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and has been influential enough in the area to be colloquially known as the "third university" of Cambridge, highlighting its significant role in technological advancements and education.

3. **Industry Role**: As a military contractor, BBN Technologies plays a crucial role in defense-related research and development, contributing to innovations like HSLS that have potential applications in secure and reliable military communications.

4. **Clarification**: It is important to note that HSLS is specifically designed for mesh networks and should not be confused with protocols intended for non-mesh network environments, ensuring its specialized application in relevant fields.
