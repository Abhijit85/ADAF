=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses agreed on a specific answer, providing clear and robust reasoning. This consistency suggests a reliable conclusion, as both responses independently arrived at the same answer using evidence from different modalities.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response indicated insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. Therefore, it does not outweigh the consistent responses from the other two agents.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Since two responses were consistent and well-reasoned, there was no need for conflict resolution. The agreement between these responses strengthens the validity of the final answer.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer is selected based on the consistent agreement of two responses, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This decision-making process ensures transparency and logical consistency, directly addressing the original question.
