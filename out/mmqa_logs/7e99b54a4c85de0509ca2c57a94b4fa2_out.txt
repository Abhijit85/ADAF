2. **Horizontal Blue Stripe**: Represents "peace, truth, and justice," underscoring the nation's commitment to these ideals.

3. **Horizontal Red Stripe**: Stands for "patriotism and valor," emphasizing the courage and love for the country.

4. **Eight-Rayed Golden Sun and Three Stars**: The sun symbolizes "unity, freedom, people's democracy, and sovereignty," with its rays historically linked to specific provinces, as noted by UP Professor Ambeth Ocampo.
