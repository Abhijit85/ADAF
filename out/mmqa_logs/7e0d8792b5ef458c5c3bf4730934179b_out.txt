=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The Coast Guard operates as a naval service during wartime, with specific conditions and historical context influencing its integration with the Navy.

1. **Definition and Scope**: The Coast Guard is defined as a naval service during wartime, which can apply to either individual components or the entire organization, depending on the situation.

2. **Historical Context**: The last full integration of the Coast Guard with the Navy occurred during World War II, highlighting a significant historical precedent for its wartime role.

3. **Peacetime Operations**: In peacetime, Coast Guard units typically remain under the jurisdiction of Homeland Security, indicating a dual role that shifts based on national needs.

4. **Current Operations**: It is important not to assume that current Coast Guard operations are under the Navy, as this is not the standard practice outside of wartime conditions.

This analysis is based on consistent insights from multiple sources, emphasizing the Coast Guard's flexible operational role and historical integration with the Navy during wartime.

Answer Echoes:
- [DEFINITION] Coast Guard operates as a naval service during wartime.
