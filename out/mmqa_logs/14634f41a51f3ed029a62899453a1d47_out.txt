=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In synthesizing the responses from the cross-modal synthesis agents, the final analysis is as follows:

1. **Consistency Check**: Two responses consistently indicated that the data shows a significant increase in user engagement on the platform over the past year, supported by robust reasoning and evidence from user activity logs and survey data.

2. **Quantitative Insight**: The platform experienced a 25% increase in daily active users, as corroborated by both user activity metrics and third-party analytics, indicating a strong upward trend in user engagement.

3. **Contextual Insight**: The increase in engagement is attributed to the introduction of new interactive features and a successful marketing campaign, as detailed in the responses, which aligns with the timing of the observed growth.

4. **Conflict Resolution**: The third response suggested a different cause for the increase, but lacked the depth and coherence of the other two. The stronger rationale provided by the consistent responses led to the selection of the increase in user engagement as the final answer.

This decision was made based on the clear, consistent evidence and reasoning provided by the majority of the responses.
