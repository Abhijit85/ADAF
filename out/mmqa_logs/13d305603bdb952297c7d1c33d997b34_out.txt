=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In synthesizing the responses from the cross-modal synthesis agents, the final analysis focuses on the most consistent and well-supported insights.

1. **Consistency Check**: Two responses consistently highlighted a significant increase in market demand for electric vehicles (EVs) over the past year, supported by robust reasoning and data from industry reports indicating a 30% rise in sales.

2. **Fallback Rule**: While one response suggested insufficient information to determine the impact of government policies on EV adoption, the other two provided concrete evidence of policy influence, citing tax incentives and subsidies as key drivers of the market growth.

3. **Conflict Resolution**: Although one response differed by emphasizing technological advancements as the primary growth factor, the other two responses offered a more comprehensive view, integrating both policy and technology as critical elements.

4. **Final Synthesis**: The final answer emphasizes the dual impact of government policies and technological advancements on the EV market's growth, with a clear preference for the responses that provided detailed evidence of policy effects, aligning with the most consistent and well-supported insights.
