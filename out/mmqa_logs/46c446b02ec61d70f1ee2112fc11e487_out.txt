=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The analysis synthesizes responses from cross-modal agents to determine the most accurate answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses agreed on a specific answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This consensus indicates a strong likelihood of accuracy, as both responses independently arrived at the same conclusion using evidence from different modalities.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response suggested insufficient information but did not provide a concrete alternative. Given the detailed evidence presented in the consistent responses, the fallback rule was not applicable, as the concrete answer was already supported by two responses.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** There was no need for conflict resolution since two responses were consistent. However, the third response's lack of a concrete answer further reinforced the reliability of the consistent responses.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was selected based on the agreement between two responses, which demonstrated clarity, depth, and coherence in their reasoning. This decision was made transparently, ensuring logical consistency and directly addressing the original question.
