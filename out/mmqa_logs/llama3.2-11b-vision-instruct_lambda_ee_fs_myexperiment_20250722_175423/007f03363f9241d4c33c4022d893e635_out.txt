=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Factual Answer Synthesis**

Based on the TabuSynth Analysis (Data-focused) and Contextron Analysis (Text + Data), I have synthesized the best factual answer to the question:

**Question:** Which players were loaned out of LA Galaxy to LA Galaxy II in the 2014 season with a start of March 21, 2014?

**Factual Answer:** The players loaned out to LA Galaxy II on March 21, 2014 were Bradford Jamieson IV, Jack McBean, Raul Mendiola, Kyle Venter, Kenney Walker, Robbie Rogers, Brian Rowe, and Chandler Hoffman.

**Source:** The table provided.

**Confidence:** High

**Reasoning:**

* The TabuSynth Analysis (Data-focused) extracted relevant information from the table about players loaned out to LA Galaxy II on March 21, 2014.
* The Contextron Analysis (Text + Data) verified the information against the data and ensured that all relevant facts are included.
* The synthesized answer combines the insights from both analyses to provide a complete and accurate factual answer.

**Synthesis Rules:**

* I have prioritized the visual information (table) when available.
* I have verified factual accuracy across all sources (table and data).
* I have preferred complete explanations with context (synthesized answer).
* I have included relevant background information (season and start date).
* I have used clear, understandable language (synthesized answer).
* I have ensured logical consistency (synthesized answer).
* I have combined visual, textual, and data insights (synthesized answer).

**Final Answer:** Bradford Jamieson IV, Jack McBean, Raul Mendiola, Kyle Venter, Kenney Walker, Robbie Rogers, Brian Rowe, and Chandler Hoffman.
