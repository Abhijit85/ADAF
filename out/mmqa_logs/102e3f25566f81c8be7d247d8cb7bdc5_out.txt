3. **Consideration but Exclusion**: Although Alice Cooper's song was considered for the film's soundtrack, it was ultimately not selected. This decision highlights the competitive nature of soundtrack selections and the specific criteria that must be met for a song to be chosen as a theme tune.

4. **Clarification**: It is important not to assume that Alice Cooper's song was part of the film, as it was only considered and not included in the final soundtrack. This distinction is crucial for understanding the song's role and its relationship to the film.
