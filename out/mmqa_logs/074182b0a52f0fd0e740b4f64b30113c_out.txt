=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The image described is of the former state flag of Mississippi, which prominently features the Confederate battle emblem.

1. **Historical Context**: The flag was adopted in 1894 and remained in use until 2020. It incorporated the Confederate battle emblem, a symbol often associated with the Confederacy during the American Civil War and viewed by many as a representation of racial segregation and oppression.

2. **Design Elements**: The flag's design includes a blue square in the top left corner with a red diagonal cross bordered in white, containing thirteen white stars. The rest of the flag is divided into two horizontal stripes, white above red, reflecting traditional Confederate colors.

3. **Cultural and Political Impact**: The flag was a subject of controversy and debate for many years, with calls for its removal due to its Confederate symbolism. In 2020, amid a broader national reckoning with racial injustice, Mississippi voted to retire the flag and adopt a new design.

4. **Replacement**: The new flag, adopted in 2021, features a magnolia blossom and the phrase "In God We Trust," symbolizing a move towards unity and inclusivity.
