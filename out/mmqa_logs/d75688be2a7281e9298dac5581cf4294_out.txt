=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two of the three responses provided the same answer with clear and robust reasoning, indicating a consensus. This aligns with Rule (A), which prioritizes consistency across responses.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response suggested insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. Therefore, Rule (B) does not apply, as the concrete answer from the other responses is more reliable.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Since two responses agreed and provided strong reasoning, there was no need to resolve conflicts between differing answers. The agreement between these responses strengthens the final decision.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer is selected based on the consistent and well-supported reasoning of the two agreeing responses. This decision is transparent and logically consistent, directly addressing the original question by leveraging the strongest evidence and rationale available.
