=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses agreed on a specific answer, both providing clear and robust reasoning. This alignment suggests a high level of confidence in the accuracy of the answer, making it the primary candidate for selection.

2. **Fallback Rule:** In this case, the fallback rule was not necessary as the consistency check already identified a strong consensus. However, it is noted that one response did provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence, reinforcing the decision.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** There was no need for conflict resolution since two responses were consistent. The third response, although differing, lacked the depth and coherence found in the other two, further justifying the selection based on consistency.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was selected based on the agreement between two responses, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This decision was influenced by the consistency and quality of the evidence provided, ensuring a logically sound and transparent conclusion.
