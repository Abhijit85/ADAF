=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The Lee Resolution was the formal call for American independence, leading to the drafting of the Declaration of Independence.

1. **Drafting Committee**: The Declaration was crafted by the "Committee of Five," a group tasked with articulating the colonies' desire for independence.
   
2. **Influence and Selection**: John Adams played a pivotal role in selecting Thomas Jefferson to draft the Declaration, recognizing Jefferson's superior writing skills and ability to convey the colonies' aspirations.

3. **Independence Day Misconception**: Although the Lee Resolution was passed on July 2, Independence Day is celebrated on July 4, the date when the Declaration was adopted.

4. **Clarification**: It is crucial not to confuse the date of the resolution with the celebration date, as the latter marks the formal adoption of the Declaration, not the initial call for independence.

This analysis synthesizes consistent insights from multiple responses, emphasizing the drafting process, key figures involved, and the distinction between the resolution and celebration dates.
