=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Final Answer:**

The Divergent series, consisting of the first three films, grossed over $765 million worldwide, showcasing its commercial success despite a decline in revenue with each subsequent release.

1. **Box Office Performance**: "Divergent" (2014) grossed over $288 million, "Insurgent" (2015) grossed over $297 million, and "Allegiant" (2016) grossed $179 million, indicating a downward trend in box office earnings.
   
2. **IMAX 3D Release**: "Insurgent" was the first in the series to be released in IMAX 3D, which likely contributed to its slightly higher gross compared to "Divergent."

3. **Overall Series Revenue**: The cumulative gross of the first three films exceeded $765 million, highlighting the series' initial strong performance but also reflecting diminishing returns over time.

4. **Market Context**: The decline in revenue from "Insurgent" to "Allegiant" suggests potential franchise fatigue or competition from other films during its release period.
