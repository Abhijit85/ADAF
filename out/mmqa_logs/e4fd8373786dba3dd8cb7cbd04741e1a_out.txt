=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two of the three responses provided the same answer with clear and robust reasoning, indicating a consensus. This consistency suggests a high level of confidence in the selected answer, as it is supported by multiple sources.

2. **Fallback Rule:** In this case, the fallback rule was not necessary, as the consistent responses already provided a concrete answer with detailed evidence, eliminating the need to rely on a single response.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** There was no need for conflict resolution since the responses did not differ significantly. The agreement between two responses allowed for a straightforward selection process.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was chosen based on the consistent agreement between two responses, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This decision-making process ensures that the selected answer is both reliable and well-substantiated, directly addressing the original question.
