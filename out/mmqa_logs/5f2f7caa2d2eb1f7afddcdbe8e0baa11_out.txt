=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Major Astley was mistakenly claimed to have won medals at the 1924 Winter Olympics in curling, but he was not eligible due to non-participation.

1. **Participation and Eligibility**: Astley was part of the reserve British curling team but did not make any appearances during the 1924 Winter Olympics, which disqualified him from medal eligibility. This aligns with the rule that only active participants can receive medals.

2. **Historical Context**: The 1924 Winter Olympics marked the first time curling was included as a demonstration sport, which may have contributed to confusion about medal allocations and participant records.

3. **Sport Definition and Relation**: Curling, akin to bowls, boules, and shuffleboard, involves sliding stones on ice towards a target area. This definition helps clarify the nature of the sport in which Astley was involved, though not actively competing.

4. **Source Verification**: The claim of Astley's medal win lacks substantiation, as verified by the context stating his reserve status and absence from competition, reinforcing the inaccuracy of the medal claim.
