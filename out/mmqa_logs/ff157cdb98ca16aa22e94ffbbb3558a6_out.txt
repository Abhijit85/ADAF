=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The final analysis synthesizes insights from three cross-modal responses to determine the most accurate answer to the given question.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses consistently indicated that the available information was insufficient to provide a definitive answer. Both responses highlighted the lack of specific data points and contextual evidence necessary to draw a concrete conclusion.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response provided a concrete answer, supported by detailed evidence. It included quantitative data and contextual analysis, which were not present in the other responses. This response offered a clear rationale, explaining the implications of the data and how it led to the conclusion.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Given the conflict between the responses, the third response was selected due to its comprehensive reasoning and robust evidence. It demonstrated a clear understanding of the question and effectively synthesized information from multiple modalities.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The decision to select the third response was based on its detailed evidence and coherent explanation, which provided a more complete and reliable answer to the question. This approach ensures that the final answer is both accurate and well-supported.
