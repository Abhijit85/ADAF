=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In synthesizing the responses from the cross-modal synthesis agents, the final answer is determined by evaluating the consistency, evidence, and reasoning provided.

1. **Consistency Check**: Two of the responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This consistency indicates a strong likelihood that this answer is correct, as it is corroborated by multiple sources.

2. **Fallback Rule**: The third response suggested insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. Therefore, it does not outweigh the consistent responses from the other two agents.

3. **Conflict Resolution**: Since there was no direct conflict among the responses, the need for conflict resolution was minimal. The consistent responses were already aligned, reducing the need for further analysis.

4. **Final Synthesis**: The final answer is selected based on the two consistent responses, which provided a coherent and well-supported rationale. This decision is transparent and logically consistent, directly addressing the original question by relying on the strongest evidence and reasoning available.
