=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two of the responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This consistency suggests a high likelihood of accuracy, as multiple sources corroborate the conclusion.

2. **Fallback Rule:** In this case, the fallback rule was not necessary, as the consistent responses already provided a concrete answer with detailed evidence, negating the need to rely on a single response.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** There was no need for conflict resolution since the consistent responses aligned, and the third response did not present a conflicting answer that required further examination.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was selected based on the consistent responses, which demonstrated clarity, depth, and coherence in their reasoning. This approach ensures that the decision is transparent and logically consistent, directly addressing the original question with the strongest supporting rationale.
