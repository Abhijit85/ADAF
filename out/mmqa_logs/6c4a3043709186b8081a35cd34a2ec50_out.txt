=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The Rooney Rule, which mandates interviews of minority candidates for head coaching jobs, is currently applied in the NFL but not in college football.

1. **Current NFL Implementation**: Despite the Rooney Rule, only 5 out of 32 NFL head coaches are African-American, highlighting limited progress in increasing minority representation at the highest coaching levels.
   
2. **College Football Context**: Minority representation among head coaches in college football is approximately 6%, which is significantly lower than the percentage of African-Americans in the U.S. population, indicating a disparity in opportunities.

3. **Advocacy for Expansion**: Legal scholars are advocating for the extension of the Rooney Rule to college football, suggesting that similar measures could help address the underrepresentation of minorities in coaching positions at the collegiate level.

4. **Broader Implications**: The lower representation of minority coaches in both the NFL and college football compared to the general population underscores systemic barriers that may require policy interventions beyond the Rooney Rule to achieve equity.

**Final Synthesis**: The analysis is based on consistent insights from the responses, emphasizing the limited effectiveness of the Rooney Rule in the NFL and the potential benefits of extending it to college football. The reasoning is supported by quantitative data on minority representation and expert advocacy for policy expansion.
