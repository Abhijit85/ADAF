=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check**: Two responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This indicates a consensus among the agents, suggesting reliability in the conclusion drawn.

2. **Fallback Rule**: The third response indicated insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. Therefore, it does not outweigh the consistent responses from the other two agents.

3. **Conflict Resolution**: Since two responses align and the third lacks a concrete answer, there is no need for conflict resolution. The consistent responses are prioritized due to their clarity and coherence.

4. **Final Synthesis**: The final answer is selected based on the two consistent responses, which demonstrated strong supporting rationale. This decision is transparent and logically consistent, directly addressing the original question by relying on the most robust evidence and reasoning available.
