=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two of the responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This indicates a consensus among the agents, which aligns with Rule (A) for selecting the final answer.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response suggested insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Rule (B), reinforcing the selection of the consistent answer from the other two responses.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Since two responses were consistent and well-reasoned, there was no need to resolve a conflict among differing answers. The consistent responses demonstrated clarity and coherence, making them the strongest candidates.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was chosen based on the agreement between two responses, which provided a clear and logical explanation. This decision was influenced by the consistency and depth of reasoning, ensuring a transparent and logically consistent conclusion.
