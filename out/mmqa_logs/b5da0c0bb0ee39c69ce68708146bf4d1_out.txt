=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Based on the synthesis of the three responses, the final analysis is as follows:

The analysis reveals a consensus on the impact of a specific policy change on economic growth.

1. **Consistency in Findings**: Two responses consistently highlight that the policy led to a 2% increase in GDP over the past year, supported by robust economic data and expert analyses, indicating a positive economic impact.

2. **Employment Growth**: Both responses also note a significant decrease in unemployment rates, with a reported drop of 1.5%, suggesting that the policy effectively stimulated job creation.

3. **Investment Surge**: The responses agree on a 10% rise in foreign direct investment, attributed to improved investor confidence and favorable regulatory conditions introduced by the policy.

4. **Divergent View**: One response diverged, suggesting insufficient data to conclusively determine the policy's impact. However, the detailed evidence provided by the other two responses, including statistical data and expert commentary, supports the positive economic outcomes.

The final decision is based on the consistency and depth of evidence provided by the majority of responses, which clearly demonstrate the policy's beneficial effects on economic growth.
