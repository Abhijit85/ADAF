=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two of the responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This indicates a consensus among the agents, which aligns with Rule (A) for selecting the final answer.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response suggested insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. Therefore, it does not override the consensus reached by the other two responses.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Since there was no significant conflict among the responses, as two were consistent, there was no need to deeply analyze the quality of reasoning for conflict resolution.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was selected based on the agreement between two responses, which demonstrated clear reasoning and evidence. This decision was influenced by the consistency and robustness of the supporting rationale, ensuring a transparent and logically consistent conclusion.
