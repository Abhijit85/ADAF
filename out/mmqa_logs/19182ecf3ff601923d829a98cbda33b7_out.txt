Additionally, a "white Volkswagen Beetle" with the number plate "LMW 281F" is parked nearby, a detail that has become part of the image's lore due to the plate being stolen repeatedly.

2. **Cultural Impact**: The image's cultural significance is highlighted by the fact that US poster companies altered it by airbrushing McCartney's cigarette without permission, indicating its widespread recognition and influence.
