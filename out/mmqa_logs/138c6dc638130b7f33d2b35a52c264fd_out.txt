=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The MacBook Air is designed with several environmentally friendly features, though it lacks some traditional hardware components.

1. **Environmental Certifications**: The MacBook Air has achieved the EPEAT Gold rating, indicating high environmental performance, which is a significant endorsement of its eco-friendly design.

2. **Material Composition**: Apple has incorporated arsenic-free glass and mercury-free displays in the MacBook Air, reducing the use of harmful substances and enhancing its environmental credentials.

3. **Design Omissions**: The device does not include a built-in removable media drive, FireWire port, Ethernet port, line-in, or media card slots, which may limit connectivity options but also reduces material usage and potential electronic waste.

4. **Sustainability Features**: Apple's focus on sustainability is evident in the MacBook Air's design choices, which prioritize environmental impact reduction over traditional hardware features.

This analysis is based on the consistent information provided by multiple sources, emphasizing the MacBook Air's eco-friendly design and the trade-offs made to achieve this.
