=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In synthesizing the responses from the cross-modal synthesis agents, the final answer is determined by evaluating the consistency, quality, and depth of reasoning provided.

1. **Consistency Check**: Two of the responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This consistency indicates a strong likelihood that the answer is accurate and reliable.

2. **Fallback Rule**: The third response suggested insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. Therefore, it does not outweigh the consistent responses from the other two agents.

3. **Conflict Resolution**: Since there was no significant conflict among the responses, as two were consistent and one was inconclusive, the need for conflict resolution was minimal.

4. **Final Synthesis**: The final answer is selected based on the consistent responses, which were supported by clear and logical reasoning. This approach ensures that the decision is transparent and directly addresses the original question, providing a reliable conclusion.
