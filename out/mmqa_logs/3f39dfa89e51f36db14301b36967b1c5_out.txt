=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** Fitz critiques early interpretations of "Antony and Cleopatra" as sexist, highlighting Cleopatra's significant role in the play.

1. **Historical Criticism:** Early criticism predominantly portrayed Cleopatra as "wicked and manipulative," focusing on her negative traits and overshadowing her complexity as a character.
   
2. **Antony's Role:** Fitz references Brandes' argument, which emphasizes Antony's contribution to the narrative and the theme of Roman greatness, suggesting that the play's focus should not solely be on Cleopatra's perceived faults.

3. **Cleopatra as a Tragic Hero:** Cleopatra's presence in Act V meets the "formal requirements of the tragic hero," indicating her pivotal role in the play's tragic structure and challenging the notion that Antony is the sole protagonist.

4. **Significance of Cleopatra's Role:** The analysis warns against assuming Antony is the sole protagonist, underscoring Cleopatra's significant and complex role, which is crucial for a balanced understanding of the play.

**Explanation:** The final synthesis is based on the consistent insights from the responses, which emphasize Cleopatra's significant role and challenge early sexist interpretations. The reasoning is clear and robust, focusing on both characters' contributions to the narrative.
