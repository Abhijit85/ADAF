=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In synthesizing the responses from the cross-modal synthesis agents, the final answer is determined by the consistency and quality of reasoning provided.

1. **Consistency Check**: Two of the responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This consistency indicates a reliable conclusion based on the evidence available.

2. **Fallback Rule**: The third response suggested insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence, reinforcing the decision to rely on the consistent responses.

3. **Conflict Resolution**: Since there was no significant conflict among the responses, the need for conflict resolution was minimal. The consistent responses were coherent and well-supported, making them the most reliable choice.

4. **Final Synthesis**: The final answer is selected based on the consistent responses, which demonstrated clarity and depth in their reasoning. This approach ensures that the decision is transparent, logically consistent, and directly addresses the original question, providing a robust conclusion.
