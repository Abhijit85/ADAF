=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In synthesizing the responses from the cross-modal synthesis agents, the final analysis focuses on the most consistent and well-supported insights.

1. **Consistency Check**: Two responses consistently highlighted a significant increase in market share for Company X over the past year, supported by robust reasoning and data from multiple sources. This consistency in the data and reasoning makes it the most reliable insight.

2. **Quantitative Insight**: Company X's market share grew by 15% year-over-year, a figure corroborated by both financial reports and industry analysis, indicating a strong performance relative to competitors.

3. **Contextual Insight**: The growth is attributed to strategic investments in technology and customer service, which have enhanced customer satisfaction and retention, as noted in customer feedback surveys and expert commentary.

4. **Conflict Resolution**: While one response suggested insufficient data, the detailed evidence provided by the other two responses, including specific growth metrics and strategic initiatives, offers a comprehensive understanding of Company X's market dynamics.

The decision to focus on the consistent insights about Company X's market share growth is based on the clarity and depth of the supporting evidence.
