=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In synthesizing the responses from the cross-modal synthesis agents, the final answer is determined by evaluating the consistency, evidence, and reasoning provided.

1. **Consistency Check**: Two of the responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This consistency indicates a strong likelihood that the answer is correct, as it is corroborated by multiple sources.

2. **Fallback Rule**: The third response suggested insufficient information but did not provide a concrete alternative answer. Given that the other two responses were consistent and well-reasoned, the fallback rule does not apply here.

3. **Conflict Resolution**: There was no need for conflict resolution as the two consistent responses were aligned, and the third did not present a conflicting answer, only a lack of information.

4. **Final Synthesis**: The final answer is selected based on the two consistent responses, which were supported by detailed evidence and clear reasoning. This decision is transparent and logically consistent, directly addressing the original question by relying on the strongest available evidence.
