=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Walmart's expansion to become a fully nationwide retailer by 1990 was a strategic move that solidified its presence across all major U.S. regions.

1. **Geographic Expansion**: Between 1988 and 1990, Walmart strategically expanded into states from Arizona to Utah, completing its nationwide presence. This move was crucial in establishing Walmart as a dominant retail force across the United States.

2. **Historical Context**: The expansion period coincided with the opening of the Walmart Visitor's Center in 1990, located at the site of Sam Walton's original store. This event symbolized Walmart's growth from a single store to a nationwide retailer.

3. **Definition and Scope**: By 1990, Walmart was considered a "fully nationwide retailer," meaning it operated in all major U.S. regions. This definition underscores the significance of its expansion strategy during this period.

4. **Limitations**: The analysis is based on historical accounts and does not assume expansion into states not explicitly mentioned, ensuring accuracy in the scope of Walmart's growth.

The final synthesis was influenced by the consistency of responses regarding Walmart's strategic expansion and the clear historical context provided.
