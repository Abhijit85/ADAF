=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The analysis synthesizes insights from three cross-modal responses to determine the most accurate answer to a given question.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses consistently indicated that the available information was insufficient to provide a definitive answer. Both responses highlighted the lack of specific data points and contextual details necessary for a conclusive analysis.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response offered a concrete answer, supported by detailed evidence. It provided a comprehensive breakdown of the available data, including statistical trends and contextual factors, which were not addressed in the other responses.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Despite the differing conclusions, the third response demonstrated superior reasoning. It presented a clear, coherent argument with a logical flow, effectively integrating quantitative data with contextual insights.

4. **Final Synthesis:** Based on the Fallback Rule and the quality of reasoning, the third response is selected as the final answer. Its detailed evidence and robust analysis provide a more complete understanding of the question, outweighing the lack of consensus among the other responses.
