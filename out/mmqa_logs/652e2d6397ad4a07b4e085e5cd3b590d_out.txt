=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The analysis synthesizes responses from cross-modal agents to determine the most accurate answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses agreed on the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This alignment suggests a high level of confidence in the selected answer, as it is corroborated by multiple sources.

2. **Fallback Rule:** In this case, the fallback rule was not necessary, as the consistent responses provided a concrete answer with detailed evidence, negating the need for reliance on a single response.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** The third response differed but lacked the depth and coherence found in the consistent responses. The reasoning in the differing response was less clear, making it less persuasive.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was chosen based on the agreement between two responses, which offered strong, coherent reasoning and evidence. This decision-making process ensures that the final answer is both reliable and well-supported, directly addressing the original question.
