=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses agreed on a specific answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This alignment suggests a high level of confidence in the accuracy of the information provided.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response indicated insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. Therefore, it was not considered for the final decision.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Since two responses were consistent and well-reasoned, there was no need for conflict resolution. The agreement between these responses was prioritized.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was selected based on the consistent and robust reasoning provided by the two agreeing responses. This decision was influenced by the clarity and coherence of their explanations, ensuring a transparent and logically consistent conclusion.
