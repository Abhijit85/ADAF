=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two of the three responses provided the same answer with clear and robust reasoning, indicating a consensus. This consistency suggests a high level of reliability in the information presented by these responses.

2. **Fallback Rule:** In this case, the fallback rule was not necessary as the consistency check already identified a clear answer. However, it is important to note that if only one response had provided a concrete answer with detailed evidence, it would have been selected.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** There was no need for conflict resolution since two responses were consistent. However, if all responses had differed, the decision would have been based on the quality of reasoning, with emphasis on clarity, depth, and coherence.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was selected based on the consistency of two responses, which provided a coherent and well-supported rationale. This approach ensures that the decision is transparent, logically consistent, and directly addresses the original question.
