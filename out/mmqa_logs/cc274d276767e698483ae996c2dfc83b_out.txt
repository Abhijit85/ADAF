=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The New Deal coalition was a powerful political force in the United States, shaping elections from 1932 to 1980. 

1. **Organizational Strength**: The coalition's influence stemmed from its "organizational heft," primarily driven by big-city political machines, which provided a robust infrastructure for mobilizing voters and resources.

2. **Lack of Formal Structure**: Despite its electoral success, the coalition was "never formally organized," indicating that its power was derived more from shared interests and goals rather than a centralized leadership or formalized structure.

3. **Internal Disagreements**: Members of the coalition "often disagreed" on key issues such as foreign policy and racial matters, highlighting the diverse and sometimes conflicting interests within the group.

4. **Historical Impact**: The coalition's influence spanned nearly five decades, underscoring its significant role in shaping American political dynamics during a critical period in history.

**Final Synthesis**: The analysis is based on the consistent insights provided by the responses, particularly focusing on the coalition's organizational strength, lack of formal structure, internal disagreements, and historical impact. These points were consistently supported by clear and robust reasoning across the responses.
