=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer. 

1. **Consistency Check**: Two of the responses provided the same answer with clear and robust reasoning, indicating a consensus. This aligns with Rule (A), which prioritizes consistency across responses.

2. **Fallback Rule**: In this case, the fallback rule was not necessary as the consistency check already provided a clear path forward. However, if needed, Rule (B) would have guided the selection of a concrete answer with detailed evidence.

3. **Conflict Resolution**: There was no need for conflict resolution since two responses were consistent. If all responses had differed, Rule (C) would have required evaluating the quality of reasoning to select the strongest rationale.

4. **Final Synthesis**: The final answer was chosen based on the consistent responses, ensuring transparency and logical consistency. The decision was directly influenced by the clear, robust reasoning provided by the majority of the responses, adhering to the original question's requirements.
