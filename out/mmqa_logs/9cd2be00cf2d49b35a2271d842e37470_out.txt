=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two of the three responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This consistency indicates a high likelihood of accuracy, as multiple sources corroborate the information.

2. **Fallback Rule:** In this case, the fallback rule was not necessary because the consistent responses already provided a concrete answer with detailed evidence, eliminating the need to rely on a single response.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Since two responses were consistent, there was no need for conflict resolution. However, the third response was considered to ensure no critical insights were overlooked.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was selected based on the consistent responses, which demonstrated clarity, depth, and coherence. The decision was influenced by the strong supporting rationale provided by these responses, ensuring a transparent and logically consistent conclusion.
