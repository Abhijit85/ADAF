=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

PA 75 is a 71.2-mile-long state highway in central Pennsylvania, running north-south from the Mason–Dixon line to an interchange with US 22/US 322.

1. **Route Details**: PA 75 begins at the Mason–Dixon line, marking the border between Pennsylvania and Maryland, and extends northward to connect with US 22/US 322, a major east-west route in Pennsylvania.

2. **Intersections**: Along its path, PA 75 intersects with PA 16 and PA 416 in Mercersburg, providing connectivity to local and regional destinations.

3. **Continuation into Maryland**: Beyond the Mason–Dixon line, PA 75 continues as Maryland Route 494 (MD 494), indicating its role as a cross-state corridor.

4. **Distinct Path**: It is important to distinguish PA 75's north-south orientation from the broader east-west route of US 22, which spans from Cincinnati, Ohio, to Newark, New Jersey, covering 337.60 miles in Pennsylvania alone.

This analysis is based on consistent information from multiple sources, emphasizing PA 75's role as a regional connector and its integration with larger transportation networks.
