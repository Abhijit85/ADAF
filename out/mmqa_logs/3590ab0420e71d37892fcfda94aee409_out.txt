=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two of the three responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This indicates a consensus among the agents, which aligns with Rule (A) for selecting the final answer.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response suggested insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Rule (B), reinforcing the selection of the consistent answer from the other two responses.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Since there was no complete disagreement among all three responses, Rule (C) was not applicable. The focus remained on the consistency and robustness of the reasoning provided by the majority.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was chosen based on the agreement between two responses, which offered clear and coherent reasoning. This decision was influenced by the alignment of evidence and logical consistency, ensuring a transparent and accurate conclusion.
