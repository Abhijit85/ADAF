=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two of the responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This indicates a consensus among the agents, which aligns with Rule (A) for selecting the final answer.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response suggested insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Rule (B), reinforcing the selection of the consistent answer from the other two responses.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Since there was no significant conflict among the responses, as two were consistent and one was inconclusive, there was no need to apply Rule (C) for conflict resolution.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer is based on the consistent responses, which were supported by clear reasoning. This decision is transparent and logically consistent, directly addressing the original question by prioritizing the most robust and coherent evidence available.
