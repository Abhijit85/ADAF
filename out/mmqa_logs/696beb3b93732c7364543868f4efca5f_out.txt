=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two of the three responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This consistency suggests a high likelihood of accuracy, making it the preferred choice under rule (A).

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response indicated insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. Therefore, it does not override the consistent responses from the other two agents.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Since there was no significant conflict among the responses, as two were consistent, there was no need to deeply analyze the quality of reasoning for conflict resolution.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer is selected based on the consistent responses, which were supported by clear reasoning. This decision aligns with the rules, ensuring a transparent and logically consistent conclusion that directly addresses the original question.
