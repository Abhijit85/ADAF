=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The analysis synthesizes responses from cross-modal agents to determine the most accurate answer to a given question, focusing on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses provided the same answer with robust reasoning, indicating a consensus. This consistency suggests reliability in the conclusion drawn by these agents.

2. **Fallback Rule:** In cases where two responses indicated insufficient information, the third response offered a concrete answer supported by detailed evidence. This response was selected due to its comprehensive rationale and the absence of conflicting information.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** When all three responses differed, the decision was based on the quality of reasoning. The response with the clearest, most coherent, and in-depth explanation was chosen, ensuring that the final answer was well-supported and logically sound.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The selected answer was chosen for its strong supporting rationale, demonstrating transparency and logical consistency. This approach ensures that the final decision directly addresses the original question with clarity and precision.
