=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In synthesizing the responses from the cross-modal synthesis agents, the final answer is determined by evaluating the consistency, quality, and depth of reasoning provided by each response.

1. **Consistency Check**: Two of the responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This consistency indicates a strong likelihood that the answer is accurate and reliable.

2. **Fallback Rule**: Although one response suggested that the information was insufficient, the other two responses provided a concrete answer with detailed evidence, reinforcing the decision to select the consistent answer.

3. **Conflict Resolution**: The third response differed but lacked the depth and coherence found in the other two responses. The reasoning in the consistent responses was more comprehensive and logically structured.

4. **Final Synthesis**: The final answer is selected based on the consistent responses, which demonstrated clear, logical reasoning and robust evidence. This approach ensures that the decision is transparent, logically consistent, and directly addresses the original question.
