=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two of the three responses provided the same answer with clear and robust reasoning, indicating a consensus. This aligns with Rule (A), which prioritizes consistency across responses.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response suggested insufficient information, but since two responses agreed on a concrete answer with detailed evidence, the fallback rule (B) was not applicable.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** There was no need for conflict resolution (C) as there was no significant disagreement among the responses. The two consistent responses were coherent and well-supported, making them the preferred choice.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was selected based on the agreement between two responses, which provided a clear and logical explanation. This decision was made by evaluating the clarity and depth of the reasoning, ensuring a transparent and consistent conclusion.
