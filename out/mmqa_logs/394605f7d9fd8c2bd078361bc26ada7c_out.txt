=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two of the three responses provided the same answer with clear and robust reasoning, indicating a consensus. This aligns with Rule (A), which prioritizes consistency in responses.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response suggested insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. Therefore, Rule (B) does not apply, as the concrete answer from the other responses is more reliable.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Since there was no significant conflict among the responses, Rule (C) was not necessary. The consistent responses were already supported by strong reasoning.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was selected based on the consistent responses, which were supported by clear and robust reasoning. This decision was influenced by the alignment of two responses and the lack of a compelling alternative from the third response. The process ensured logical consistency and directly addressed the original question.
