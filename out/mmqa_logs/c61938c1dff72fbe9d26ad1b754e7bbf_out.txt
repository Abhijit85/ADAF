=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The "rickey" is a classic highball cocktail that originated in Washington, D.C., and has gained global popularity.

1. **Origin and Ingredients**: The rickey was first crafted by George A. Williamson at Shoomaker's bar in Washington, D.C. It traditionally includes bourbon, lime, and carbonated water, though it later became popular worldwide when gin was used instead of bourbon.

2. **Popularity Shift**: While initially made with bourbon, the rickey's global popularity surged when gin was introduced as an alternative base spirit, highlighting the drink's versatility and appeal.

3. **Comparison with Other Cocktails**: The rickey is distinct from the greyhound, which is made with grapefruit juice and gin or vodka. A variation of the greyhound, known as the "salty dog," features a salted rim, showcasing the diversity of highball and cocktail recipes.

4. **Cultural Impact**: The rickey's evolution from a local favorite to a globally recognized cocktail underscores the dynamic nature of cocktail culture and the influence of regional innovations on international trends.
