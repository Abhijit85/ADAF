=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Paradoxical sleep, also known as REM sleep, is characterized by distinct physiological changes that impact breathing and brain activity.

1. **Breathing Control**: During REM sleep, the brain exerts less control over breathing, which can lead to irregular breathing patterns. This reduced control is significant because it highlights the vulnerability of respiratory functions during this sleep stage.

2. **Diminished Reflexes**: Respiratory reflexes, such as the response to hypoxia, are diminished in REM sleep. This reduction in reflexive responses can pose risks, particularly for individuals with pre-existing respiratory conditions.

3. **Brain Activity**: REM sleep is marked by fluctuations in brain activity, notably PGO waves and rapid eye movements. These fluctuations are indicative of the heightened brain activity that occurs during this sleep stage, despite the overall relaxation of the body's muscles.

The analysis is based on consistent findings from multiple sources, emphasizing the unique physiological state of REM sleep and its implications for respiratory and neurological functions.

- [SOURCE] Information is repeated verbatim multiple times.
- [NOTE] Brain exerts "less control over breathing" during REM sleep.
- [WARNING] "Respiratory reflexes such as response to hypoxia diminish" in REM sleep.
- [NOTE] Fluctuations coincide with "PGO waves and rapid eye movements".
