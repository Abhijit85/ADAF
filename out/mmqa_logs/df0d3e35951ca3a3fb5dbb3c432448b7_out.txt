=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Spermaceti is a waxy substance found in the head cavities of sperm whales, with significant historical and biological importance.

1. **Volume and Composition**: The spermaceti organ in sperm whales can contain up to 1900 liters of this substance, highlighting its substantial presence and potential utility in the whale's physiology.

2. **Etymology and Source**: The term "spermaceti" is derived from the Greek words "sperma" and "ceti," indicating its historical linguistic roots and association with marine life.

3. **Distribution**: While primarily found in sperm whales, spermaceti is also present in smaller quantities in other whale oils, suggesting a broader distribution among cetaceans.

4. **Clarification**: It is crucial not to confuse spermaceti with other whale-derived substances, as it has distinct properties and uses.

**Final Synthesis**: The analysis is based on consistent information from multiple responses, emphasizing the volume, etymology, distribution, and distinct nature of spermaceti. The decision was influenced by the clarity and consistency of the data provided across the responses.
