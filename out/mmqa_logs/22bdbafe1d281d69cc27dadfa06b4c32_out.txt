=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** "Lucy, the Daughter of the Devil" is an American computer-animated TV series that aired on Adult Swim, featuring a unique blend of comedy and animation.

1. **Voice Acting Transition:** Jessi Klein voiced the character Lucy in the pilot episode, but Melissa Bardin Galsky took over the role for the series. This change highlights the common practice in TV production where pilot episodes may have different cast members than the final series.

3. **Network and Audience:** Airing on Adult Swim, a programming block known for its edgy and unconventional content, suggests that the series targeted a niche audience interested in alternative and adult-oriented animation.

4. **Cultural Context:** Jessi Klein, a self-proclaimed "geek" and comedy writer, contributed to the pilot, reflecting the series' appeal to a demographic that appreciates humor and geek culture, aligning with Adult Swim's brand identity.

**Explanation:** The final synthesis was based on the consistent information provided by multiple responses, particularly focusing on the voice acting transition, creative leadership, network context, and cultural appeal, which were all supported by clear and robust reasoning.
