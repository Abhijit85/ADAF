=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In synthesizing the responses from the cross-modal synthesis agents, the final analysis focuses on the most consistent and well-supported insights.

1. **Consistency Check**: Two responses consistently highlighted a significant increase in market share for Company X over the past year, supported by robust reasoning and data from multiple sources. This consistency in the data and reasoning makes it the most reliable insight.

2. **Quantitative Insight**: Company X's market share grew by 15% year-over-year, a figure corroborated by both financial reports and industry analysis, indicating a strong performance relative to competitors.

3. **Contextual Insight**: The growth is attributed to successful product launches and strategic partnerships, which were emphasized in two responses. These factors were identified as key drivers of the company's competitive advantage.

4. **Conflict Resolution**: While one response suggested insufficient information, the detailed evidence provided in the other two responses, including market trends and consumer behavior analysis, offered a comprehensive understanding of the situation.

The final decision is based on the consistency and depth of the evidence supporting Company X's market share growth, aligning with the rules for selecting the most accurate answer.
