=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The analysis synthesizes responses from cross-modal agents to determine the most accurate answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses consistently indicated that the available information was insufficient to provide a definitive answer. They both highlighted gaps in data and the need for further evidence to draw a reliable conclusion.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response provided a concrete answer, supported by detailed evidence. It presented a well-structured argument, citing specific data points and contextual factors that were not addressed by the other responses.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Despite the initial consensus on insufficient information, the third response's depth and coherence in reasoning were compelling. It offered a comprehensive analysis, integrating quantitative data with contextual insights to support its conclusion.

4. **Final Synthesis:** Based on the Fallback Rule, the concrete answer from the third response is selected. Its robust evidence and clear rationale outweighed the lack of consensus, providing a more informed and reliable conclusion.
