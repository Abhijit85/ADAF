=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two of the three responses provided the same answer with clear and robust reasoning, indicating a consensus. This consistency suggests a high level of confidence in the selected answer, as it is supported by multiple sources.

2. **Fallback Rule:** In this case, the fallback rule was not necessary, as the consistent responses already provided a concrete answer with detailed evidence, negating the need to rely on a single response.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** There was no need for conflict resolution since the responses did not differ significantly. The consistent responses were coherent and well-reasoned, making them the most reliable choice.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was selected based on the consistency and clarity of the reasoning provided by the two agreeing responses. This approach ensures that the decision is transparent, logically consistent, and directly addresses the original question.
