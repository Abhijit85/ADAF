=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The formation of the Communist Party of India (CPI) and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] is marked by two distinct historical claims, reflecting the complex origins of communist movements in India.

1. **Formation Dates and Locations**: The CPI claims its formation on 26 December 1920 in Kanpur, while the CPI(M) asserts its origins on 17 October 1920 in Tashkent. This discrepancy highlights the dual narratives within Indian communist history.

2. **Key Figures and Influences**: The Tashkent group, which included prominent figures like M.N. Roy, was linked to the "Second Congress of the Communist International," indicating significant foreign influence in its establishment.

3. **Global Context**: The early 20th century saw multiple communist groups forming globally, often with foreign assistance, underscoring the international dimension of the communist movement.

4. **Regional Leadership**: Among regional leaders, only Shaukat Usmani became a member of the CPI, suggesting limited integration of local leaders into the broader communist framework.

The analysis is based on the consistency of the formation dates and the contextual insights provided by the source notes, emphasizing the international and local dynamics of the communist movement in India.
