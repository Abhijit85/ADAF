=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The 1945 NCAA football season rankings are notable for their historical context and subsequent retroactive changes. 

1. **Poll Participation**: The Associated Press poll, a key determinant of rankings, involved 116 voters, reflecting a broad consensus in the evaluation of teams during that season.
   
2. **Retroactive Title**: Oklahoma State was retroactively named the 1945 champion in 2016, highlighting how historical perceptions can be altered by later decisions, which can impact the legacy and recognition of teams from that era.

3. **Terminology Clarification**: In this context, "Army" refers to the United States Military Academy, and "Navy" refers to the United States Naval Academy, both of which were prominent teams during the 1945 season.

4. **Historical Impact**: The retroactive awarding of titles, such as Oklahoma State's, underscores the complexities in historical sports rankings and the importance of contemporary records in shaping long-term narratives.

This analysis is based on the consistent information provided by the responses, focusing on the key elements of the 1945 season and the implications of retroactive decisions.
