=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The analysis synthesizes responses from cross-modal agents to determine the most accurate answer to a given question, following a structured decision-making process.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses provided the same answer with clear and robust reasoning, indicating a consensus. This consistency suggests a high level of confidence in the selected answer, as it is supported by multiple sources.

2. **Fallback Rule:** In the absence of a consensus, one response offered a concrete answer with detailed evidence, while the others indicated insufficient information. This detailed response was chosen due to its comprehensive evidence, ensuring a well-supported conclusion.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** When all responses differed, the decision was based on the quality of reasoning. The response with the clearest, most coherent, and in-depth explanation was selected, ensuring that the final answer was well-founded and logically sound.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was chosen based on the strongest supporting rationale, ensuring transparency and logical consistency. This approach ensures that the decision directly addresses the original question with the most reliable information available.
