=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two of the three responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This consistency suggests a high likelihood of accuracy, making it the preferred choice under rule (A).

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response indicated insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. Therefore, it does not override the consistent responses from the other two agents.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Since two responses were consistent and well-reasoned, there was no need to resolve conflicts between differing answers. The consistent responses were prioritized due to their clarity and coherence.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was selected based on the agreement between two responses, which demonstrated strong supporting rationale. This decision was influenced by the clear, logical reasoning and the alignment of evidence across multiple modalities, ensuring a transparent and consistent conclusion.
