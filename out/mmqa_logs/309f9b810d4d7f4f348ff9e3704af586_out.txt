=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis synthesizes insights from three cross-modal responses to determine the most accurate answer based on the given rules.

1. **Consistency Check**: Two responses agree that the data indicates a significant increase in user engagement on the platform, supported by a 25% rise in active users over the past quarter. This consistency in quantitative data and reasoning makes it the selected answer.

2. **Fallback Rule**: Although one response suggests insufficient information, the other two provide concrete evidence of increased engagement, making the concrete answer more reliable.

3. **Conflict Resolution**: The third response, which differs, lacks the depth and coherence found in the other two. It fails to provide robust evidence or a clear rationale, weakening its position.

4. **Final Synthesis**: The decision to select the increase in user engagement as the final answer is based on the consistent quantitative data and strong reasoning provided by the majority of responses. This approach ensures a transparent and logically consistent conclusion.
