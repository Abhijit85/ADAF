=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Shield volcanoes are characterized by their broad, gently sloping profiles, formed primarily through the accumulation of fluid lava flows. 

1. **Formation and Structure**: Shield volcanoes are built almost entirely of fluid lava flows, which spread out in all directions, creating their distinctive broad and gently sloping shape. This is in contrast to stratovolcanoes, which have steeper profiles due to more viscous lava.

2. **Lava Characteristics**: The lava that forms shield volcanoes is typically low in viscosity, allowing it to travel further and spread out in thin layers, contributing to the volcano's expansive base and gentle slopes.

3. **Comparison with Stratovolcanoes**: Unlike shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes are characterized by more viscous lava, leading to steeper, more conical profiles. This distinction is crucial for understanding the different volcanic structures and their potential impacts.

4. **Geological Significance**: The formation of shield volcanoes provides insights into volcanic activity and the geological processes that shape the Earth's surface, highlighting the role of lava viscosity in determining volcanic morphology.

This analysis is based on consistent insights from multiple responses, emphasizing the unique characteristics and formation processes of shield volcanoes.
