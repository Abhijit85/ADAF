=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** Lift is a fundamental aerodynamic force acting on airplane wings, generated by the interaction between the wing and the air, as explained by Newton's laws.

1. **Definition and Mechanism:** Lift is defined as the reaction force that occurs opposite to the change in the direction of air, specifically in the context of airfoil dynamics like airplane wings. This is based on Newton's second and third laws, where the wing exerts a downward force on the air, and in response, the air exerts an upward force on the wing.

2. **Quantitative Insight:** The magnitude of lift is directly related to the amount of air displaced by the wing and the speed at which the air moves over the wing surface. This relationship is crucial for understanding how airplanes achieve and maintain flight.

3. **Contextual Clarification:** It is important to distinguish lift from other aerodynamic forces such as thrust and drag. While lift acts perpendicular to the direction of motion, thrust propels the aircraft forward, and drag opposes this motion.

4. **Application Scope:** The principles of lift are specifically applicable to airfoil dynamics, emphasizing the role of wing design and angle of attack in optimizing lift for efficient flight.

Answer Echoes:
- [DEFINITION] "Lift" is the reaction force generated opposite to the air's directional change.
- [SCOPE] Applies to "airfoil" dynamics, specifically airplane wings.
- [SOURCE] Based on "Newton's second and third law" principles.
- [NOTE] Wing exerts "downward force on the air," air exerts "upward force on the wing."
- [WARNING] Do not confuse lift with thrust or drag forces.
