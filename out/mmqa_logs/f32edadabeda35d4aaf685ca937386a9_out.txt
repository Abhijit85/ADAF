=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The "Chewbacca defense" is a legal strategy designed to confuse the jury rather than directly counter the opposing argument. 

1. **Origin and Popularization**: The term was popularized by the "South Park" episode "Chef Aid," which aired on October 7, 1998, on Comedy Central. This episode satirized the defense tactics used by Johnnie Cochran during the O. J. Simpson trial.

2. **Definition and Usage**: The "Chewbacca defense" is particularly used in legal contexts, especially in criminal cases, where the aim is to distract and confuse rather than provide a logical refutation of the opposing case.

3. **Logical Fallacy**: This strategy is akin to the fallacy ignoratio elenchi, also known as a "red herring," where irrelevant information is introduced to divert attention from the main issue.

4. **Cultural Impact**: The episode featured notable guest stars like Joe Strummer, Ozzy Osbourne, and Elton John, highlighting its cultural reach and the broader commentary on legal strategies in high-profile cases.

This analysis is based on the consistent information provided by multiple sources, emphasizing the term's origin, definition, and application in legal contexts.
