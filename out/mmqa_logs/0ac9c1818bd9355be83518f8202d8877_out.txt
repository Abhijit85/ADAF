=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In synthesizing the responses from the cross-modal synthesis agents, the final analysis focuses on the most consistent and well-supported insights.

1. **Consistency Check**: Two responses consistently highlighted the significant increase in market share for electric vehicles (EVs) over the past year, supported by robust reasoning and data indicating a 20% growth rate. This consistency in data and reasoning makes it the primary insight.

2. **Fallback Rule**: While one response suggested insufficient information to determine the impact of government policies on EV adoption, another provided detailed evidence of policy-driven incentives, such as tax rebates, contributing to a 15% increase in consumer adoption rates. This concrete evidence supports the role of government policies.

3. **Conflict Resolution**: All responses agreed on the importance of technological advancements in battery efficiency, but one provided a clearer rationale, citing a 10% improvement in battery life as a key driver for consumer interest.

4. **Final Synthesis**: The analysis concludes that the growth in EV market share is primarily driven by technological advancements and government incentives, with a notable 20% increase in market share and a 15% rise in adoption due to policy support.
