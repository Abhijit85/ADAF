=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** Among the terrestrial planets, Earth uniquely possesses an active hydrosphere, characterized by a dynamic water cycle.

1. **Definition and Scope:** Terrestrial planets, such as Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, are rocky planets. However, only Earth has an active hydrosphere, which involves a dynamic water cycle, unlike the other terrestrial planets.

2. **Active Hydrosphere:** An active hydrosphere is defined by the presence of a dynamic water cycle, which includes processes such as evaporation, precipitation, and water flow. This is a key feature that distinguishes Earth from its terrestrial counterparts.

3. **Unique Earth Feature:** The presence of an active hydrosphere on Earth supports a wide range of life forms and contributes to the planet's climate regulation, making it unique among the terrestrial planets.

4. **Cautionary Note:** It is important not to assume that other terrestrial planets have similar hydrospheres, as the evidence clearly indicates that Earth is the only one with this feature.

**Final Synthesis:** The analysis is based on the consistent information that Earth is the only terrestrial planet with an active hydrosphere, supported by the definition and scope provided. This conclusion is drawn from the clear and robust reasoning found in the majority of the responses.
