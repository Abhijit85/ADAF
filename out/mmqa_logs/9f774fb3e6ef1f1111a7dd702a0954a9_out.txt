=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The cover art for "Angry All The Time (Acoustic Version)" by Tim McGraw is a minimalist design that emphasizes the artist's name and song title.

1. **Design Focus**: The cover art features ornate, stylized text for "Tim McGraw" at the top, which draws attention to the artist's name, suggesting a focus on brand recognition and artist identity.
   
2. **Title Presentation**: The song title "Angry All The Time" is prominently displayed, with the "(Acoustic Version)" in smaller text, indicating a specific version of the song that may appeal to fans of acoustic music or those seeking a different interpretation of the original track.
