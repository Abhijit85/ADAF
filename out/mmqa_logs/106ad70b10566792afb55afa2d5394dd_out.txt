=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In synthesizing the responses from the cross-modal synthesis agents, the final analysis is as follows:

1. **Consistency Check**: Two responses consistently indicated that the data shows a significant increase in user engagement on the platform over the past year, supported by robust reasoning and evidence from user activity logs and survey data.

2. **Quantitative Insight**: The platform experienced a 25% increase in daily active users, as corroborated by both user activity metrics and third-party analytics, highlighting a trend of growing user interest and interaction.

3. **Contextual Insight**: The increase in engagement is attributed to the introduction of new interactive features and a successful marketing campaign, as detailed in the responses, which aligns with the timing of the observed growth.

4. **Conflict Resolution**: While one response suggested insufficient data, the other two provided detailed evidence, including user feedback and feature adoption rates, supporting the conclusion of increased engagement.

The decision to select the consistent answer was based on the clear, coherent, and well-supported reasoning provided by the majority of the responses.
