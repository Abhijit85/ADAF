2. **Labor Force**: By 1868, the construction workforce included 12000 Chinese emigrant workers, highlighting the diverse labor force that was instrumental in the railroad's completion.

3. **Completion**: The "Golden Spike" was hammered on May 10, 1869, symbolizing the completion of the transcontinental railroad and marking a significant achievement in connecting the United States.

4. **Brand Identity**: The Union Pacific logo, characterized by a shield shape with a blue top section and red and white stripes, represents the company's enduring brand identity and its historical significance in American transportation.
