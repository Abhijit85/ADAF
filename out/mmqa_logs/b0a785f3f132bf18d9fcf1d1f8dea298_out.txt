=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Final Answer:**

The movie poster for "Future World" effectively conveys a post-apocalyptic theme through its visual and textual elements.

1. **Title and Theme**: The title "Future World" prominently displayed in bold letters, combined with the tagline "Welcome to Paradise," suggests a juxtaposition of dystopian elements with an ironic twist on the concept of paradise, indicating a post-apocalyptic setting.

2. **Visual Imagery**: The desert-like background and warm color scheme reinforce the post-apocalyptic theme, suggesting a barren, desolate environment typical of such narratives.

3. **Character Dynamics**: The depiction of a character in a dynamic pose below the title implies action or conflict, which is a common element in post-apocalyptic films, hinting at survival or struggle within this world.

4. **Star Power**: The inclusion of well-known actors like James Franco, Lucy Liu, and Milla Jovovich at the top of the poster suggests a high-profile production, potentially drawing audiences interested in both the genre and the cast.

**Explanation**: This synthesis is based on the consistent emphasis across responses on the title, theme, and visual elements of the poster, which collectively highlight the post-apocalyptic nature of the film. The reasoning is clear and supported by the poster's design and textual cues.
