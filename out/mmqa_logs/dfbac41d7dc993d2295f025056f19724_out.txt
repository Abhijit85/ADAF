3. **Cultural Impact**: Featuring top models of the era, the video not only challenged industry norms but also contributed to the rise of the "supermodel" phenomenon, highlighting their influence beyond fashion.

4. **Artistic Choice**: By choosing not to appear in the video, Michael made a bold artistic statement about identity and freedom, aligning with the song's message and enhancing its cultural resonance.
