=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The analysis synthesizes responses from cross-modal agents to determine the most accurate answer to a given question, focusing on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses provided the same answer with robust reasoning, indicating a consensus. This consistency suggests reliability in the conclusion drawn by these agents.

2. **Fallback Rule:** In the absence of a consensus, one response offered a concrete answer supported by detailed evidence, while the others indicated insufficient information. This detailed response was selected due to its comprehensive support and clarity.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** When all responses differed, the decision was based on the quality of reasoning. The response with the clearest, most coherent, and in-depth explanation was chosen, ensuring the final answer was well-supported.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The selected answer was based on a transparent and logical decision-making process, directly addressing the original question by weighing consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality. This approach ensures the final answer is both accurate and well-justified.
