=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis focuses on the strategic movements and outcomes of the Army of Operations led by Santa Anna in Texas during February 1836, a pivotal period in the Texas Revolution.

1. **Military Strategy**: Santa Anna's Army of Operations, a well-organized military force, advanced into Texas with the strategic aim of quelling the Texian rebellion, demonstrating a significant military commitment to maintaining Mexican control over the region.

2. **Battle of the Alamo**: The most notable event during this period was the Battle of the Alamo, where Santa Anna's forces besieged the mission, resulting in the near-total loss of Texian defenders, highlighting the Mexican army's tactical superiority and the high human cost for the Texians.

3. **Historical Impact**: The events of February 1836, particularly the fall of the Alamo, became a rallying point for Texian forces, galvanizing support and resistance against Mexican rule, which played a crucial role in the subsequent stages of the Texas Revolution.

4. **Lack of Aftermath Details**: The available context does not provide information on the immediate aftermath of these battles, leaving a gap in understanding the short-term consequences for both the Texian and Mexican forces.
