=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The curling stone, also known as a "rock" in North America, is a carefully designed piece of equipment used in the sport of curling.

1. **Weight and Dimensions**: According to the World Curling Federation, the stone's weight ranges from 38 to 44 pounds, ensuring consistency and fairness in the sport.
   
2. **Design Features**: The stone features a concave bottom, a design proposed by J. S. Russell, which contributes to its unique movement on the ice.
   
3. **Running Surface**: The running surface of the stone is a "narrow, flat annulus or ring," which is crucial for its glide and control during play.
   
4. **Clarification**: It is important not to confuse the stone's bulging sides with the running surface, as the latter is specifically designed for optimal performance.

This analysis synthesizes consistent information from multiple sources, focusing on the stone's specifications and design, which are critical for its function in curling.
