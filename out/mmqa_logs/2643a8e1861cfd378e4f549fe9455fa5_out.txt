=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The tests conducted in April 1944 at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough, demonstrated significant advancements in high-speed flight capabilities.

1. **Mach Number Achievement**: Squadron Leader J. R. Tobin achieved a Mach number of 0.891, indicating that the Spitfire PR XI reached 89.1% of the speed of sound, with a true airspeed (TAS) of 606 mph. This highlights the aircraft's advanced aerodynamic design and performance capabilities during the period.

2. **Instrumentation**: The Spitfire PR XI was equipped with a "rake type" multiple pitot system, which was crucial for accurately measuring airspeed and ensuring the reliability of the Mach number calculations.

3. **Operational Challenges**: The tests were not without issues, as evidenced by Martindale's flight, which ended in a forced landing due to engine over-revving. This incident underscores the technical challenges and risks associated with pushing aircraft to their performance limits.

4. **Historical Context**: These tests were part of broader efforts during World War II to enhance aircraft performance, reflecting the intense focus on technological innovation in aviation during the era.

**Final Synthesis**: The analysis is based on consistent information from multiple responses, emphasizing the significant Mach number achievement, the role of advanced instrumentation, operational challenges, and the historical context of the tests.
