=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) offers job-protected, unpaid leave for specific family and medical reasons, impacting both employers and employees.

1. **Coverage Scope**: FMLA applies to situations such as pregnancy, adoption, foster care placement, and family military leave, providing essential support for employees during significant life events.
   
2. **Administration**: The U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division oversees FMLA, ensuring compliance and addressing any disputes or issues that arise under the act.

3. **Employer Applicability**: Not all employers are required to comply with FMLA, as it only applies to "covered employers," which typically include public agencies and private-sector employers with 50 or more employees.

4. **Financial Implications**: Since FMLA leave is unpaid, employees may face financial challenges during their leave period, potentially affecting their decision to utilize the leave or the duration of leave they can afford to take.

This analysis is based on consistent insights from multiple responses, emphasizing the act's scope, administration, employer applicability, and financial implications for employees.
