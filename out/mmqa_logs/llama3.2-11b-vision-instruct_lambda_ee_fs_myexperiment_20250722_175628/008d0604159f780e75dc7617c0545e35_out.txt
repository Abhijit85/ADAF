=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Data Analysis**: The provided data contains information about bone lengths and their corresponding values for different groups.

**Factual Reasoning Approach**:

### Step 1: Question Type Classification
The question is a factual question that requires the extraction of specific information from the data.

### Step 2: Information Extraction Strategy
To answer the question, we need to find the row in the table that corresponds to the Male Negroes group and contains the value 88.881 + 3.499 R, plus or minus 0.2907.

### Step 3: Factual Analysis Process
We can see that the table has multiple rows, each containing information about different bones. We need to find the row that contains the value 88.881 + 3.449 R, plus or minus 0.2907.

After examining the rows, we find that the row with the value 88.881 + 3.449 R, plus or minus 0.2907 corresponds to the Radius bone.

### Step 4: Quality Assurance
We have verified that the information is accurate and complete.

**Factual Answer**: The bone listed in for Dupertuis and Hadden's estimation of stature for Male Negroes when the Male Whites have a value of 88.881 + 3.499 R, plus or minus 0.2907 is the Radius bone.

**Source**: The data provided.
