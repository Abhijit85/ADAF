=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two of the three responses provided the same answer with clear and robust reasoning, indicating a consensus. This consistency suggests a high likelihood of accuracy, as multiple sources corroborate the information.

2. **Fallback Rule:** In this case, the fallback rule was not necessary because the consistent responses already provided a concrete answer with detailed evidence, eliminating the need to rely on a single response.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** There was no need for conflict resolution since two responses aligned, reducing the complexity of decision-making and reinforcing the reliability of the chosen answer.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was selected based on the agreement between two responses, supported by clear reasoning and evidence. This approach ensures that the decision is transparent, logically consistent, and directly addresses the original question, providing a well-rounded and substantiated conclusion.
