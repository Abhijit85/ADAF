=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two of the three responses provided the same answer with clear and robust reasoning, indicating a consensus. This aligns with Rule A, which prioritizes consistency across responses.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response suggested insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. Therefore, it does not override the consistent responses from the other two agents.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Since there was no significant conflict among the responses, as two were consistent and one was inconclusive, there was no need to deeply analyze conflicting reasoning.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer is based on the consistent responses, which were supported by clear and robust reasoning. This decision is transparent and logically consistent, directly addressing the original question by prioritizing the most reliable and well-supported information.
