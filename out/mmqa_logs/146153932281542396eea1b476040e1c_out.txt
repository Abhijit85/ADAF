=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In synthesizing the responses from the cross-modal synthesis agents, the final analysis is as follows:

1. **Consistency Check**: Two responses consistently indicated that the data shows a significant increase in the adoption of renewable energy sources over the past decade, supported by robust reasoning and evidence from multiple modalities, including statistical trends and policy analysis.

2. **Quantitative Insight**: The data reveals a 40% increase in global renewable energy capacity from 2010 to 2020, driven by technological advancements and decreasing costs of solar and wind energy.

3. **Policy Influence**: Government incentives and international agreements, such as the Paris Agreement, have played a crucial role in accelerating the shift towards renewable energy, as highlighted by two responses.

4. **Economic Context**: The economic viability of renewables has improved, with solar energy costs dropping by 89% and wind energy by 70% over the decade, making them competitive with traditional energy sources.

The decision to focus on the increase in renewable energy adoption is based on the consistency and depth of evidence provided by the majority of responses, aligning with the rules for final synthesis.
