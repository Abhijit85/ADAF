=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In synthesizing the responses from the cross-modal synthesis agents, the final analysis focuses on the most consistent and well-supported insights.

1. **Consistency Check**: Two responses consistently highlighted a significant increase in market share for Company X over the past year, supported by robust reasoning and data from multiple sources. This consistency in the data and reasoning makes it the primary insight.

2. **Quantitative Insight**: Company X's market share grew by 15% year-over-year, a figure corroborated by both financial reports and industry analysis, indicating a strong performance relative to competitors.

3. **Contextual Insight**: The growth is attributed to strategic investments in technology and customer service, which were emphasized in two responses. These investments have enhanced customer satisfaction and operational efficiency, driving market expansion.

4. **Conflict Resolution**: While one response suggested insufficient data, the detailed evidence provided by the other two responses, including specific growth metrics and strategic initiatives, offered a more compelling and coherent narrative.

The final decision is based on the consistency and depth of the evidence supporting Company X's market share growth and strategic advancements.
