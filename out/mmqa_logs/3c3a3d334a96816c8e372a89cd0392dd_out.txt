=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two of the three responses provided the same answer with clear and robust reasoning, indicating a consensus. This aligns with Rule (A), which prioritizes consistency in responses.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response suggested insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria of Rule (B), which would have allowed it to override the consensus if it had strong evidence.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Since there was no significant conflict among the responses, Rule (C) was not applicable. The two consistent responses were coherent and well-reasoned, making them the preferred choice.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer is based on the two consistent responses, as they provided a clear, logical, and well-supported rationale. This decision-making process ensures transparency and logical consistency, directly addressing the original question.
