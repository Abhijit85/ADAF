=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The analysis synthesizes insights from three cross-modal responses to determine the most accurate answer to a given question, following a structured decision-making process.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses agreed on a specific answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This consensus indicates a strong likelihood of accuracy, as the agreement is based on well-substantiated evidence from multiple modalities.

2. **Fallback Rule:** In the absence of unanimous agreement, one response provided a concrete answer with detailed evidence, while the others suggested insufficient information. This detailed response was considered due to its comprehensive evidence base, which outweighed the lack of consensus.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** When all responses differed, the decision was guided by evaluating the quality of reasoning. The response with the clearest, most coherent, and in-depth explanation was selected, ensuring that the final answer was well-supported and logically sound.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The chosen answer was derived from a transparent and consistent decision-making process, emphasizing the importance of robust evidence and clear reasoning in resolving discrepancies among the responses.
