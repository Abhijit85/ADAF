=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The A380's pricing and market perception in 2016 highlighted significant challenges for the aircraft's commercial viability.

2. **Historical Pricing Context**: Singapore Airlines' sale-and-leaseback of an A380 for $197 million in 2007 provides a benchmark for understanding the aircraft's valuation over time, suggesting that the list price may have increased significantly by 2016.

3. **Market Skepticism**: Industry experts expressed doubts about the A380 project’s ability to "pay for itself," indicating concerns about the aircraft's long-term financial sustainability and the potential mismatch between its cost and market demand.

4. **Strategic Implications**: The skepticism and pricing issues reflect broader strategic challenges for Airbus, as the A380 struggled to secure a sustainable market position amidst evolving airline preferences and economic pressures.
