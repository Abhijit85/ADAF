=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In synthesizing the responses from cross-modal synthesis agents, the final answer is determined by evaluating the consistency, evidence, and reasoning provided.

1. **Consistency Check**: Two responses consistently indicated that the available information was insufficient to provide a definitive answer. This suggests a lack of clear evidence across modalities to support a concrete conclusion.

2. **Fallback Rule**: Despite the majority indicating insufficient information, one response provided a concrete answer with detailed evidence. This response was supported by robust reasoning, including specific data points and contextual analysis that were not present in the other responses.

3. **Conflict Resolution**: The response with the concrete answer demonstrated superior clarity and depth. It included a comprehensive synthesis of the available data, offering a coherent narrative that logically addressed the question.

4. **Final Synthesis**: Based on the Fallback Rule, the concrete answer with detailed evidence was selected as the final answer. This decision was influenced by the strength of the supporting rationale, which provided a clear and logical explanation despite the overall insufficiency of information.
