=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In synthesizing the responses from the cross-modal synthesis agents, the final analysis is as follows:

1. **Consistency Check**: Two responses consistently indicated that the data supports a significant increase in the adoption of renewable energy sources over the past decade, citing robust evidence from multiple studies and statistical reports. This consistency in findings and reasoning makes this the selected answer.

2. **Quantitative Insight**: The responses highlighted a 30% increase in global renewable energy capacity from 2010 to 2020, with solar and wind energy being the primary contributors to this growth.

3. **Contextual Insight**: The increase is attributed to technological advancements, decreasing costs of renewable technologies, and supportive government policies worldwide, which have collectively driven the shift towards cleaner energy sources.

4. **Conflict Resolution**: Although one response suggested insufficient data, the detailed evidence provided by the other two responses, including specific growth percentages and policy impacts, offered a more compelling and coherent rationale.

This synthesis reflects a clear trend towards renewable energy adoption, supported by quantitative data and contextual factors.
