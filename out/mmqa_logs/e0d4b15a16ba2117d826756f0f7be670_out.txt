=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The final analysis synthesizes insights from three cross-modal responses to provide a comprehensive answer.

1. **Consistency Check**: Two responses consistently indicate that the available information is insufficient to provide a definitive answer. They both highlight the lack of specific data points or evidence necessary to draw a concrete conclusion, emphasizing the need for more detailed information to support any claims.

2. **Fallback Rule**: The third response offers a concrete answer, suggesting a specific outcome based on detailed evidence. This response provides a well-structured argument, citing relevant data and contextual factors that support its conclusion, making it a strong candidate for selection.

3. **Conflict Resolution**: Given the conflict between the responses, the third response is selected due to its robust reasoning and comprehensive use of evidence. It presents a clear, logical argument that effectively synthesizes the available information, outweighing the lack of consensus in the other responses.

4. **Final Synthesis**: The decision to select the third response is based on its detailed evidence and coherent rationale, which provide a more complete and convincing answer to the original question. This approach ensures a transparent and logically consistent resolution.
