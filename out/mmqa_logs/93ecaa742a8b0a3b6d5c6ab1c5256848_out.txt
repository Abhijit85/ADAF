=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** Playback singers in South Asia have significantly influenced the music industry, achieving remarkable records in terms of the number of recordings.

1. **Record Achievements:** Lata Mangeshkar was recognized in 1991 by the "Guinness Book of World Records" for having over 30000 recordings, highlighting her prolific contribution to the industry.
   
2. **Most Recorded Artist:** In 2011, Asha Bhosle was acknowledged as the most recorded artist, underscoring her extensive and enduring impact on South Asian music.

3. **Contested Records:** There is a claim that Dr. K J Yesudas replaced Lata Mangeshkar in 1991 as the record holder, but this requires further citation, indicating some ambiguity in historical records.

4. **Cultural Influence:** The achievements of these playback singers not only reflect their personal success but also illustrate the broader cultural significance of playback singing in South Asian cinema.

**Final Synthesis:** The analysis is based on consistent information from multiple responses, particularly the recognition of Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle by the "Guinness Book of World Records." The claim about Dr. K J Yesudas lacks sufficient evidence, thus it is noted but not emphasized. This decision is based on the clarity and consistency of the available data.
