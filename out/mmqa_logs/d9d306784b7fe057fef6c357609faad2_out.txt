=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The Des Moines–West Des Moines, IA MSA experienced significant population growth from 2010 to 2017.

1. **Population Increase**: The population of the Des Moines–West Des Moines metropolitan statistical area (MSA) increased by 76278 people, from 569633 in 2010 to 645911 in 2017, indicating a growth rate of approximately 13.4% over seven years.

2. **Geographical Scope**: This MSA encompasses five counties in central Iowa: Polk, Dallas, Warren, Madison, and Guthrie, which collectively contributed to the observed population growth.

3. **Data Source**: The population figures are derived from the 2010 census and 2017 estimates, providing a reliable basis for analyzing demographic changes within the specified period.

4. **Limitations**: The analysis is constrained to data up to 2017, and no assumptions should be made about trends beyond this year, ensuring that conclusions are based solely on the available evidence.

**Final Synthesis**: The analysis is based on consistent data from two responses that highlighted the population growth and geographical scope, supported by clear reasoning and evidence from census data.
