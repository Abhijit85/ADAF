=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two of the three responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This consistency suggests a high likelihood of accuracy, as multiple sources corroborate the conclusion.

2. **Fallback Rule:** In this case, the fallback rule was not necessary, as the consistent responses already provided a concrete answer with detailed evidence, negating the need to rely on a single response.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** There was no need for conflict resolution since two responses aligned, and the third did not present a significantly stronger argument to challenge the consensus.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was selected based on the consistent agreement between two responses, which were supported by clear and logical reasoning. This approach ensures that the decision is transparent and logically consistent, directly addressing the original question.
