=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** Supersonic speeds in commercial aviation have been achieved by various aircraft, with notable instances involving both planned and unplanned events.

1. **Historical Achievement:** The Douglas DC-8 achieved supersonic speed on August 21, 1961, during a controlled dive to test a new wing design, marking a significant milestone in aviation research and development.

2. **Technical Definition:** Supersonic speeds are defined as exceeding 1240 km/h (776.2 mph), a threshold that has been crossed by commercial airliners under specific conditions, such as the DC-8's test flight.

3. **Safety Concerns:** The China Airlines 747 incident highlights the dangers of unplanned supersonic descents, where the aircraft experienced over 5g forces, underscoring the importance of controlled conditions for supersonic travel.

4. **Broader Context:** While the Concorde and Tu-144 are well-known for their supersonic capabilities, other aircraft like the DC-8 have also contributed to the understanding and development of supersonic commercial flight.

**Final Synthesis:** The analysis focuses on both historical and safety aspects of supersonic commercial flights, with the DC-8's controlled supersonic dive providing valuable data for aviation advancements, while the China Airlines incident serves as a cautionary example of the risks involved. The decision was based on the consistent and detailed reasoning provided by the majority of responses, emphasizing both the technical achievements and safety considerations.

Answer Echoes:
- [DEFINITION] "Supersonic speeds" refer to speeds exceeding the speed of sound, approximately 1,240 km/h (776.2 mph).
- [SCOPE] The context covers instances of commercial airliners breaking the sound barrier, not limited to Concorde and Tu-144.
- [SOURCE] The Douglas DC-8's supersonic flight occurred on "21 August 1961" during a controlled dive.
- [NOTE] The DC-8's flight aimed to "collect data on a new leading-edge design for the wing."
- [WARNING] The China Airlines 747 incident involved an "unplanned descent" and reached "over 5g," indicating a dangerous situation.
