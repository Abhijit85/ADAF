=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution delineates the division of power between federal and state governments, emphasizing state sovereignty. 

1. **Historical Context**: The language of the Tenth Amendment was influenced by the Articles of Confederation, which emphasized state sovereignty and limited federal authority. This historical context underscores the framers' intent to balance power between the national and state governments.

2. **Proposed Amendments**: Thomas Tudor Tucker and Elbridge Gerry advocated for amendments that would restrict federal powers to those "expressly" delegated, highlighting early debates on the scope of federal authority.

3. **Implied Powers**: The omission of the word "expressly" in the Tenth Amendment allows for the interpretation of implied powers under the Necessary and Proper Clause, providing flexibility in federal authority.

4. **Practical Considerations**: James Madison argued that limiting federal powers to only those expressly stated was impractical, suggesting a need for a more adaptable federal government capable of addressing unforeseen challenges.

This analysis synthesizes the historical, legal, and practical dimensions of the Tenth Amendment, reflecting its role in shaping federal-state relations.
