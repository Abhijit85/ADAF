=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on a set of rules.

1. **Consistency Check**: If two or more responses agree and provide robust reasoning, that answer is selected. This ensures that the final answer is supported by multiple sources, enhancing its reliability.

2. **Fallback Rule**: When two responses indicate insufficient information but one provides a concrete answer with detailed evidence, the concrete answer is chosen. This prioritizes responses that offer specific insights over those that highlight gaps in information.

3. **Conflict Resolution**: In cases where all responses differ, the quality of reasoning is assessed. The response with the clearest, most coherent, and in-depth explanation is selected. This approach values the strength of the argument over mere consensus.

4. **Final Synthesis**: The final answer is accompanied by a summary of the decision-making process, ensuring transparency and logical consistency. This step is crucial for addressing the original question effectively and justifying the chosen answer.
