=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In synthesizing the responses from the cross-modal synthesis agents, the final answer is determined by evaluating the consistency, quality, and depth of reasoning provided by each response.

1. **Consistency Check**: Two of the responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This alignment suggests a strong consensus among the agents, indicating reliability in the conclusion drawn.

2. **Fallback Rule**: The third response, while offering a different perspective, lacked the detailed evidence and concrete reasoning found in the other two responses. This further supports the decision to select the consistent answer provided by the majority.

3. **Conflict Resolution**: The differing response did not present a compelling argument with sufficient clarity or depth to outweigh the consensus. The reasoning was less coherent and lacked the robust evidence seen in the other responses.

4. **Final Synthesis**: The final answer is selected based on the majority consensus, which was supported by clear, logical reasoning and robust evidence. This approach ensures that the decision is transparent, logically consistent, and directly addresses the original question.
