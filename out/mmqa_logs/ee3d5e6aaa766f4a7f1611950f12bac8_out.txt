=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The analysis synthesizes responses from cross-modal agents to determine the most accurate answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses agreed on the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This alignment suggests a high level of confidence in the conclusion drawn from the available data.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response indicated insufficient information but did not provide a concrete alternative answer. This lack of a definitive stance further supports the selection of the consistent answer from the other two responses.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** The consistent responses offered detailed evidence and coherent reasoning, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the modalities involved. The third response lacked the depth and clarity necessary to challenge the consensus.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was selected based on the agreement between two responses, which provided strong, evidence-backed reasoning. This decision-making process ensures that the chosen answer is both reliable and well-supported, addressing the original question effectively.
