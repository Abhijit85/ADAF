=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Electrum, also known as "green gold," is an alloy of silver and gold that was recognized by the Lydians around 860 BC. 

1. **Historical Context**: The Lydians, an ancient civilization, were among the first to recognize and utilize electrum, highlighting its historical significance in early metallurgy and currency.
   
2. **Physical Characteristics**: Despite its name, electrum appears "greenish-yellow" rather than purely green, which is a result of its unique composition of silver and gold.

3. **Material Properties**: Electrum has advantageous properties over pure gold, such as better adhesion for fired enamels, making it a preferred material in certain artistic and practical applications.

4. **Cultural Impact**: The use of electrum by the Lydians underscores its value and utility in ancient societies, influencing trade and economic systems of the time.

This analysis is based on the consistent information provided by multiple responses, emphasizing electrum's historical, physical, and practical significance.
