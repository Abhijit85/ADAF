=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The final analysis synthesizes insights from three cross-modal responses to provide a comprehensive answer. 

1. **Consistency Check**: Two responses consistently indicate that the data supports a significant increase in user engagement following the implementation of a new feature. Both responses cite robust evidence, including a 25% rise in daily active users and a 30% increase in session duration, underscoring the feature's positive impact.

2. **Fallback Rule**: The third response suggests insufficient information to draw a conclusion, but the detailed evidence from the other two responses provides a concrete basis for the analysis, making the fallback rule unnecessary.

3. **Conflict Resolution**: There is no conflict to resolve as the two consistent responses offer clear, coherent reasoning supported by quantitative data, which outweighs the third response's lack of conclusion.

4. **Final Synthesis**: The decision to highlight the feature's success is based on the strong, consistent evidence of increased user engagement metrics, demonstrating the feature's effectiveness in enhancing user interaction.
