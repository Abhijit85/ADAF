=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The nine most abundant elements in the Earth's crust account for the majority of its mass, with each contributing significantly to its composition.

1. **Mass-Abundance Definition:** "Mass-abundance" is a measure of how much of an element's mass is present in the Earth's crust, expressed as a percentage.

2. **Scope of Analysis:** The analysis focuses exclusively on the nine most abundant elements, as these elements collectively dominate the Earth's crust composition.

3. **Exclusion of Minor Elements:** Elements that occur at less than 0.15% are not considered in this analysis, emphasizing the dominance of the top nine elements.

4. **Data Source:** For further details on the specific percentages and rankings of these elements, refer to the "abundance of elements in Earth's crust" on Wikipedia.

**Final Synthesis:** The analysis is based on the consistent information provided by the responses, which align in focusing on the nine most abundant elements and their significant contribution to the Earth's crust. The exclusion of elements below 0.15% further clarifies the scope, ensuring a focused and accurate representation of the crust's composition.

- [DEFINITION] "Mass-abundance" refers to the percentage of an element's mass in the Earth's crust.
- [SCOPE] The list includes only the "nine most abundant elements" in the Earth's crust.
- [SOURCE] For more details, see "abundance of elements in Earth's crust" on Wikipedia.
- [NOTE] Other elements occur at "less than 0.15%" in the Earth's crust.
- [WARNING] Do not assume data beyond the "nine most abundant elements" listed.
