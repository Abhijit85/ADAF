=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The analysis synthesizes responses from cross-modal agents to determine the most accurate answer to a given question, focusing on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning, indicating a consensus. This consistency suggests a high likelihood of accuracy, as multiple modalities corroborate the conclusion.

2. **Fallback Rule:** In the absence of a consensus, one response offered a concrete answer with detailed evidence, while the others indicated insufficient information. This detailed response was selected due to its comprehensive evidence base, demonstrating a thorough analysis.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** When all responses differed, the decision was based on the quality of reasoning. The selected answer had the most coherent and in-depth explanation, showcasing a logical progression of thought and strong supporting rationale.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was chosen by weighing the consistency and depth of reasoning across responses. The decision-making process was transparent and logically consistent, ensuring the selected answer directly addressed the original question.
