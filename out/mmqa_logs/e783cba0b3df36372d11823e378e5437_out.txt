=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer to a given question.

1. **Consistency Check**: If two or more responses agree and provide robust reasoning, that answer is selected. This ensures reliability by prioritizing consensus backed by strong evidence.

2. **Fallback Rule**: When two responses indicate insufficient information but one provides a detailed answer, the concrete answer is chosen. This approach values specificity and evidence when consensus is lacking.

3. **Conflict Resolution**: If all responses differ, the decision is based on the quality of reasoning. The response with the clearest, most coherent, and in-depth explanation is selected, ensuring the decision is well-founded.

4. **Final Synthesis**: The final answer is accompanied by a summary of key points that influenced the decision. This step ensures transparency and logical consistency, directly addressing the original question with a well-supported conclusion.
