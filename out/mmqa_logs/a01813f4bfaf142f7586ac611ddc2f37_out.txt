=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The Oakland Raiders' relocation to Las Vegas was a significant event in NFL history, marked by strategic decisions and logistical considerations.

1. **Approval and Decision**: The relocation was overwhelmingly approved by NFL team owners with a 31–1 vote, indicating strong support for the move within the league. This decision was announced during the annual league meetings in Phoenix, Arizona, on March 27, 2017.

2. **Historical Context**: The Raiders became the third NFL team to relocate in the 2010s, highlighting a trend of team movements during this decade, often driven by stadium issues and market opportunities.
