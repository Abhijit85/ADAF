=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two of the three responses provided the same answer with clear and robust reasoning, indicating a consensus. This consistency suggests a high level of confidence in the selected answer, aligning with Rule (A).

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response, while differing, did not provide sufficient evidence or reasoning to outweigh the consensus. This aligns with Rule (B), where the concrete answer with detailed evidence from the majority is preferred.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** The differing response lacked depth and coherence compared to the other two, which offered detailed explanations and evidence. This supports the decision to prioritize the majority answer, as per Rule (C).

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was chosen based on the majority consensus, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This decision-making process was transparent and logically consistent, directly addressing the original question.
