=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The path to U.S. statehood for territories like Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico involves complex political processes, including voter referendums and the necessity of congressional approval.

1. **Referendum Results:** Both Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico have conducted referendums where a majority of voters expressed support for statehood. These votes reflect a significant public desire for statehood but do not guarantee it.

2. **Congressional Approval Requirement:** Despite favorable referendum outcomes, statehood requires congressional approval, which is a significant hurdle. This legislative step is crucial and often influenced by political considerations beyond the territories' control.

3. **Potential Candidates:** Other U.S. territories, such as American Samoa and Guam, also have the potential to pursue statehood. However, they have not yet held referendums similar to those in D.C. and Puerto Rico.

4. **Uncertainty of Statehood:** The process is inherently uncertain, as even with public support, the political climate and legislative priorities in Congress can delay or prevent the admission of new states.

**Final Synthesis:** The analysis is based on the consistent information from multiple responses that emphasize the dual requirement of referendums and congressional approval for statehood. The reasoning highlights the complexity and uncertainty of the process, which is influenced by both public opinion and political dynamics in Congress.
