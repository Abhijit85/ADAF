=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses agreed on a specific answer, both providing clear and robust reasoning. This alignment suggests a high level of confidence in the accuracy of the answer, making it the primary candidate for selection.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response indicated insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. This lack of specificity and detail makes it less reliable compared to the consistent responses.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Since two responses were consistent and well-reasoned, there was no need for conflict resolution. The agreement between these responses, supported by clear evidence, outweighed the uncertainty of the third response.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was selected based on the consistent agreement and robust reasoning of the two responses. This decision was influenced by the clarity and coherence of their explanations, ensuring a logically consistent and well-supported conclusion.
