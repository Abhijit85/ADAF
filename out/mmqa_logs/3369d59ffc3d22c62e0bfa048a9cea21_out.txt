=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In synthesizing the responses from the cross-modal synthesis agents, the final answer is determined by evaluating the consistency, quality, and depth of reasoning provided by each response.

1. **Consistency Check**: Two of the responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This consistency indicates a strong likelihood that the answer is accurate and reliable.

2. **Fallback Rule**: The third response suggested insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. Therefore, it does not outweigh the consistent responses from the other two agents.

3. **Conflict Resolution**: Since two responses were consistent and well-reasoned, there was no need for further conflict resolution. The consistent responses were prioritized due to their clarity and coherence.

4. **Final Synthesis**: The final answer is selected based on the consistent responses, which were supported by strong reasoning. This decision ensures that the answer is both accurate and well-substantiated, directly addressing the original question with transparency and logical consistency.
