=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This indicates a consensus among the agents, suggesting reliability in their conclusion.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response offered a concrete answer with detailed evidence, but since two responses already agreed on an answer, the fallback rule was not necessary.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** There was no need for conflict resolution as the consistency check already identified a consensus. However, the reasoning in the consistent responses was evaluated for clarity and coherence, confirming their robustness.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was selected based on the consistency check, as two responses aligned with clear reasoning. This decision was influenced by the agreement among responses and the strength of their supporting rationale, ensuring a logically consistent and well-supported conclusion.
