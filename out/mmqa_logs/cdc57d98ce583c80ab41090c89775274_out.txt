=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The screenplay for "Dances with Wolves" was initially a spec script, which later became a successful film, despite the novel facing multiple rejections before its publication.

1. **Spec Script Definition:** The screenplay for "Dances with Wolves" was written as a spec script, meaning it was created without a prior contract, highlighting the risk and uncertainty involved in its initial development.

2. **Filming Locations:** The film was shot in notable locations such as Badlands National Park and the Black Hills, which contributed to its authentic and visually striking portrayal of the American frontier.

3. **Previous Collaboration:** Kevin Costner, who starred in the film, had previously worked with the writer on "Stacy's Knights," suggesting a pre-existing professional relationship that may have facilitated the film's production.
