=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Based on the synthesis of the three responses, the final analysis is as follows:

The analysis of the data reveals a significant trend in the market's growth trajectory.

1. **Consistency Check**: Two responses consistently highlight a 15% year-over-year increase in market size, supported by robust reasoning that includes historical data trends and recent market reports. This consistency in data and reasoning makes it a reliable insight.

2. **Fallback Rule**: While one response suggests insufficient information, the other two provide concrete evidence of growth, including specific figures and sources, reinforcing the credibility of the 15% growth rate.

3. **Conflict Resolution**: The third response, although differing slightly in percentage, lacks the depth and coherence found in the other two responses. The detailed analysis and clear rationale in the consistent responses outweigh the less substantiated claim.

4. **Final Synthesis**: The decision to highlight the 15% growth is based on the alignment of two responses with strong, evidence-backed reasoning, ensuring a transparent and logically consistent conclusion.
