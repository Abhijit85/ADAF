=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The analysis synthesizes insights from three cross-modal responses to determine the most accurate answer to a given question, following a structured decision-making process.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This consistency indicates a high likelihood of accuracy, as multiple modalities converged on the same conclusion.

2. **Fallback Rule:** In the absence of unanimous agreement, one response offered a concrete answer with detailed evidence. This response was considered due to its comprehensive rationale, which outweighed the lack of consensus.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** All three responses differed, necessitating an evaluation of reasoning quality. The selected answer demonstrated superior clarity, depth, and coherence, making it the most compelling choice.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was chosen based on the strongest supporting rationale, ensuring transparency and logical consistency. This approach directly addressed the original question by prioritizing evidence-backed reasoning.
