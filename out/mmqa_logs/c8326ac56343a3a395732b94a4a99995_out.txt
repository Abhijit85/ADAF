=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In synthesizing the responses from the cross-modal synthesis agents, the final answer is determined by evaluating the consistency, evidence, and reasoning provided.

1. **Consistency Check**: Two of the responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This consistency indicates a strong likelihood that the answer is accurate and reliable.

2. **Fallback Rule**: The third response suggested insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. Therefore, it does not outweigh the consistent responses from the other two agents.

3. **Conflict Resolution**: Since two responses were consistent and well-reasoned, there was no need to resolve any conflict among differing answers. The consistent responses were prioritized.

4. **Final Synthesis**: The final answer is selected based on the majority agreement and the strength of the reasoning provided. The decision-making process was transparent and logically consistent, ensuring that the chosen answer directly addresses the original question with clarity and depth.
