=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two of the responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This indicates a consensus among the agents, which aligns with Rule (A) for selecting the final answer.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response suggested insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Rule (B), reinforcing the selection of the consistent answer from the other two responses.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Since there was no significant conflict among the responses, as two were consistent, there was no need to apply Rule (C). The consistent responses had clear, coherent reasoning, making them the strongest candidates.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer is based on the consistent responses, which were selected due to their robust reasoning and alignment with the task rules. This decision ensures transparency and logical consistency, directly addressing the original question.
