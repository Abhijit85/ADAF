=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

2. **Crowd Size and Attire**: The large crowd dressed in white garments suggests the event is Hajj, where pilgrims wear Ihram clothing, symbolizing purity and equality before God.

3. **Architectural Context**: The multi-level colonnade and tall minarets surrounding the Kaaba are characteristic of the Masjid al-Haram, the largest mosque in the world, underscoring the location's significance.
