=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The filming locations for the project include a mix of urban and rural settings in and around London, with a focus on historical and scenic sites.

1. **Geographical Scope**: The filming took place in London and the Home Counties, specifically mentioning Surrey and Buckinghamshire, as well as stately homes in Bedfordshire and Hampshire. This indicates a preference for locations with historical and architectural significance.

2. **Specific Locations**: Notable sites include Highbury Terrace, Greenwich Hospital, Betchworth, Amersham, and St Bartholomew-the-Great. These locations are likely chosen for their distinctive architectural features and historical ambiance, which can enhance the visual storytelling.

3. **Unique Filming Spot**: Exterior shots for a funeral scene were uniquely filmed in Thurrock, Essex, overlooking the River Thames. This choice suggests a need for a specific scenic backdrop that complements the narrative's emotional tone.

4. **Exclusivity of Locations**: The analysis is limited to the explicitly mentioned locations, ensuring accuracy and avoiding assumptions about additional filming sites. This careful selection underscores the importance of each location's contribution to the overall aesthetic and narrative of the project.
