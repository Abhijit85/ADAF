=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The history of Moon landings encompasses both manned and unmanned missions, with the first successful landing being the Soviet Union's Luna 2 in 1959.

1. **First Successful Mission:** Luna 2, launched by the Soviet Union, was the first human-made object to reach the Moon's surface on September 13, 1959. This mission marked a significant milestone in space exploration.

2. **Definition and Scope:** Moon landings include both manned and unmanned missions, highlighting the diverse approaches taken by various space programs to explore the lunar surface.

3. **Clarification on Manned vs. Unmanned:** While Luna 2 was the first successful mission, it was an unmanned spacecraft. The distinction between manned and unmanned missions is crucial to understanding the progression of lunar exploration.

4. **Historical Context:** The success of Luna 2 set the stage for subsequent missions, including the famous manned Apollo landings by NASA, which further expanded human understanding of the Moon.

**Final Synthesis:** The analysis is based on consistent information from multiple responses, emphasizing Luna 2's role as the first successful Moon landing and the importance of distinguishing between manned and unmanned missions.
