=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses provided the same answer with clear and robust reasoning, indicating a consensus. This consistency suggests a reliable conclusion, as multiple sources corroborate the information.

2. **Fallback Rule:** In this case, the fallback rule was not necessary because the consistent responses already provided a concrete answer with detailed evidence, eliminating the need to rely on a single response.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** There was no need for conflict resolution since two responses aligned, and the third did not present a conflicting answer with stronger reasoning.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was selected based on the consistent responses, which offered clear, coherent, and well-supported reasoning. This approach ensures that the decision is transparent and logically consistent, directly addressing the original question with the most reliable information available.
