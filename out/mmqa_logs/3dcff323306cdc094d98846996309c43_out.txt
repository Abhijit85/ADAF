=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses agreed on a specific answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This alignment suggests a high level of confidence in the accuracy of the information provided.

2. **Fallback Rule:** In this case, the fallback rule was not necessary as the consistency check already provided a clear direction. However, it is noted that one response did offer a concrete answer with detailed evidence, reinforcing the chosen answer.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** There was no need for conflict resolution since two responses were consistent. However, the third response, while differing, lacked the depth and coherence found in the other two, further justifying the selected answer.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was chosen based on the agreement between two responses, which provided a coherent and well-supported rationale. This decision-making process was transparent and logically consistent, ensuring the final answer directly addressed the original question.
