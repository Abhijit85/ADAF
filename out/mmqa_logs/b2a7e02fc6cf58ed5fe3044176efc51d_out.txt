=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The analysis synthesizes responses from cross-modal agents to determine the most accurate answer to a given question, following a structured decision-making process.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses provided the same answer with robust reasoning, indicating a consensus. This consistency suggests reliability in the conclusion drawn by these agents.

2. **Fallback Rule:** In the absence of a consensus, one response offered a concrete answer supported by detailed evidence, while the others indicated insufficient information. This detailed response was considered due to its comprehensive nature.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** When all responses differed, the decision was based on the quality of reasoning. The response with the clearest, most coherent, and in-depth explanation was selected, ensuring the final answer was well-supported.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The chosen answer was based on the strongest rationale, ensuring transparency and logical consistency. This approach directly addressed the original question, providing a well-rounded and justified conclusion.
