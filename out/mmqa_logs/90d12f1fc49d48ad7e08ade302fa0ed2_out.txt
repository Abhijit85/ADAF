=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The analysis synthesizes insights from three cross-modal responses to determine the most accurate answer to a given question, following a structured decision-making process.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses consistently provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This consistency indicates a high level of agreement and reliability in the data presented by these responses.

2. **Fallback Rule:** In the absence of unanimous agreement, one response offered a concrete answer with detailed evidence, while the others suggested insufficient information. This concrete answer was considered due to its comprehensive evidence base.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** When all three responses differed, the decision was based on the quality of reasoning. The response with the clearest, most coherent, and in-depth explanation was selected, ensuring that the final answer was well-supported.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was chosen based on the strongest supporting rationale, ensuring transparency and logical consistency. This approach directly addressed the original question by prioritizing clarity and evidence-backed reasoning.
