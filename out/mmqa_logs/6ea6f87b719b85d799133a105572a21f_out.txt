=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In synthesizing the responses from the cross-modal synthesis agents, the final analysis is as follows:

1. **Consistency Check**: Two responses consistently indicated that the available information was insufficient to provide a definitive answer. Both responses highlighted the lack of specific data points and contextual details necessary to draw a concrete conclusion.

2. **Fallback Rule**: The third response offered a concrete answer, supported by detailed evidence. It provided a comprehensive analysis of the available data, including statistical trends and contextual factors, which were not addressed in the other responses.

3. **Conflict Resolution**: Given the disparity among the responses, the third response was selected due to its robust reasoning and depth of analysis. It demonstrated a clear understanding of the question and effectively utilized the available evidence to support its conclusion.

4. **Final Synthesis**: The final answer is based on the third response, which provided a well-supported conclusion. This decision was influenced by the clarity and coherence of its argument, as well as its ability to integrate quantitative and contextual insights effectively.
