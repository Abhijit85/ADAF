=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check**: Two responses agreed on a specific answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This consistency suggests a reliable conclusion, as multiple modalities corroborate the same outcome.

2. **Fallback Rule**: In this case, the fallback rule was not necessary, as the consistent responses provided a concrete answer with detailed evidence, making it unnecessary to rely on a single response.

3. **Conflict Resolution**: There was no need for conflict resolution since the consistent responses aligned, eliminating discrepancies and reinforcing the chosen answer's validity.

4. **Final Synthesis**: The final answer was selected based on the agreement between two responses, which provided a coherent and well-supported rationale. This decision was influenced by the clarity and depth of the reasoning, ensuring a transparent and logically consistent conclusion that directly addresses the original question.
