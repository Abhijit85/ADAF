=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The logo for "Girl Meets World" by Disney is designed to visually convey the show's themes and branding.

1. **Design Elements:** The logo prominently features the words "Girl" and "World" in large, bold blue letters, which likely aims to capture attention and emphasize the show's title. The smaller "meets" in black suggests a connection or transition between the two larger concepts.

2. **Symbolism:** The stylized "o" in "World" as a globe with visible continents adds a global or worldly dimension to the logo, hinting at themes of exploration, learning, or interconnectedness, which are often central to Disney's storytelling.

3. **Branding:** The inclusion of the "Disney" name above the logo reinforces the brand's association with family-friendly content and quality entertainment, potentially attracting a broad audience familiar with Disney's reputation.

4. **Target Audience:** The playful yet sophisticated design elements suggest the show is aimed at a younger audience, possibly pre-teens or teenagers, who are navigating the complexities of growing up, aligning with Disney's typical demographic.
