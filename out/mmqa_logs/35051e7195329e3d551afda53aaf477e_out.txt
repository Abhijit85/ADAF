=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The analysis synthesizes responses from cross-modal agents to determine the most accurate answer to a given question, following a structured decision-making process.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This consistency indicates a high likelihood of accuracy, as multiple modalities converged on the same conclusion.

2. **Fallback Rule:** In the absence of consistent answers, one response offered a concrete answer with detailed evidence. This response was considered due to its comprehensive use of available data, even when others deemed the information insufficient.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** When all responses differed, the decision was based on the quality of reasoning. The response with the clearest, most coherent, and in-depth explanation was selected, ensuring that the chosen answer was well-supported.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was determined by evaluating the consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality across responses. This methodical approach ensured a transparent and logically consistent decision, directly addressing the original question.
