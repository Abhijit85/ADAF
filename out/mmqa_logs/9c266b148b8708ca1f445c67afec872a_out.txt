=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The analysis synthesizes insights from three cross-modal responses to determine the most accurate answer to a given question, following a structured decision-making process.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This consistency indicates a high level of agreement and reliability in the information presented, making it the preferred choice.

2. **Fallback Rule:** In this case, the fallback rule was not necessary as the consistency check already identified a strong consensus. However, it is noted that one response did offer a concrete answer with detailed evidence, which aligns with the consistent responses.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** There was no need for conflict resolution as the responses did not differ significantly. The agreement among the responses suggests that the evidence and reasoning were coherent and well-supported.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was selected based on the consistent agreement between two responses, which provided clear and robust reasoning. This decision was influenced by the clarity and depth of the explanations, ensuring a transparent and logically consistent conclusion.
