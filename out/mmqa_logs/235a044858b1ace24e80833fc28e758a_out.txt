=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The Vince Lombardi Trophy is awarded annually to the Super Bowl winner, with each team keeping its trophy permanently.

1. **Permanent Ownership**: Unlike trophies such as the Stanley Cup or Grey Cup, which are passed between winners, each Super Bowl-winning team retains its own Vince Lombardi Trophy permanently, highlighting the unique tradition of the NFL in celebrating its champions.

2. **Historical Exception**: An exception to this rule occurred with Super Bowl V, where the Baltimore Colts retained the trophy even after the team relocated to Indianapolis, an event known as the "Midnight Mayflower" move. This underscores the trophy's symbolic connection to the team rather than its geographic location.

3. **Unique Tradition**: The retention of the trophy by each winning team emphasizes the NFL's approach to honoring its champions, ensuring that each victory is commemorated with a lasting symbol of achievement.

The analysis is based on consistent information from multiple sources, confirming the unique tradition of the Vince Lombardi Trophy's permanent ownership by winning teams, with the noted exception of Super Bowl V.
