=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Expedition 12 was a significant mission to the International Space Station (ISS), marking several key milestones.

1. **Historical Context**: The ISS, a habitable artificial satellite, has been in orbit since its first component was launched in 1998. Expedition 12 was the 12th mission to this continuously evolving space station.

2. **International Collaboration**: This expedition was notable for including Marcos Pontes, the first Brazilian astronaut, highlighting the international collaboration that the ISS represents.

3. **Launch and Landing**: The mission launched from Kazakhstan using the Russian Soyuz TMA-7 spacecraft, demonstrating the ongoing partnership between different space agencies. The crew safely returned to Kazakhstan on April 8, 2006.

4. **Visibility**: The ISS, including during Expedition 12, can be seen with the naked eye from Earth, making it a visible symbol of human achievement in space exploration.

In synthesizing the responses, the consistent details about the mission's international aspects, launch and landing specifics, and the ISS's visibility were key in forming this analysis.
