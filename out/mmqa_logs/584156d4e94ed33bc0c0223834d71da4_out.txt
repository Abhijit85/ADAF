=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The analysis synthesizes insights from three cross-modal responses to determine the most accurate answer to a given question.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses consistently indicated that the available information was insufficient to provide a definitive answer. Both responses highlighted the lack of specific data points and contextual details necessary for a conclusive analysis.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response offered a concrete answer, supported by detailed evidence. It provided a comprehensive breakdown of the available data, including quantitative metrics and contextual factors, to justify its conclusion.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Despite the initial consensus on insufficient information, the third response's depth and clarity in reasoning were compelling. It presented a well-structured argument, integrating evidence from multiple modalities to support its conclusion.

4. **Final Synthesis:** Based on the Fallback Rule, the concrete answer from the third response is selected as the final answer. Its robust evidence and coherent rationale outweighed the initial consensus on data insufficiency, providing a more complete and informed perspective.
