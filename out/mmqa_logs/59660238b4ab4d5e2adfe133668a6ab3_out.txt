=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two of the responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This consistency suggests a high likelihood of accuracy, as multiple sources corroborate the conclusion.

2. **Fallback Rule:** In this case, the fallback rule was not necessary, as the consistent responses already provided a concrete answer with detailed evidence, making it unnecessary to rely on a single response.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** There was no need for conflict resolution since the responses did not differ significantly. The consistent responses were coherent and well-reasoned, eliminating the need to weigh differing opinions.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was selected based on the consistency of two responses, which provided a clear and logical explanation. This decision was influenced by the alignment of evidence and reasoning across multiple sources, ensuring a reliable conclusion.
