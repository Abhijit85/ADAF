=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two of the three responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This indicates a consensus among the agents, which aligns with Rule (A) for selecting the final answer.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response suggested insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Rule (B), reinforcing the selection of the consistent answer from the other two responses.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Since there was no complete disagreement among all three responses, Rule (C) was not applicable. The consistent responses were already selected based on their clarity and coherence.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was chosen based on the agreement between two responses, which provided a well-supported rationale. This decision was made transparently, adhering to the rules and ensuring logical consistency in addressing the original question.
