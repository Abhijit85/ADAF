=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The analysis synthesizes responses from cross-modal agents to determine the most accurate answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses agreed on a specific answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This consistency indicates a reliable conclusion, aligning with Rule A.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response suggested insufficient information, but the consistent responses provided detailed evidence, reinforcing the chosen answer's validity.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** The differing response lacked the depth and coherence found in the consistent answers, which were well-supported by quantitative data and contextual insights.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer is selected based on the agreement of two responses, which demonstrated strong reasoning and evidence. This decision is transparent and logically consistent, directly addressing the original question by prioritizing the most substantiated and coherent analysis.
