=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two of the three responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This consistency indicates a strong likelihood that this answer is correct, as it aligns with the majority and is well-supported.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response suggested insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. Therefore, it does not outweigh the consistent responses from the other two agents.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Since two responses were consistent and well-reasoned, there was no need for conflict resolution. The consistent responses were prioritized due to their clarity and coherence.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was selected based on the consistent and well-supported responses from two agents. This decision was influenced by the clear reasoning and alignment between these responses, ensuring a logically consistent and evidence-backed conclusion.
