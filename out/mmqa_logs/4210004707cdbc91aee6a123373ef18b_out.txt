=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The sulfite process, developed by Carl Daniel Ekman in Bergvik, Sweden, between 1871 and 1874, revolutionized wood pulp production for paper manufacturing.

1. **Geographical Impact**: Ekman's work had a broad international scope, influencing the paper industry across Sweden, England, Germany, France, the US, Russia, and Italy, highlighting the global reach and significance of his innovation.

2. **Industrial Expansion**: After emigrating to England in 1879, Ekman established a mill in Northfleet, Kent, in 1886, demonstrating the practical application and expansion of the sulfite process beyond its Swedish origins.

3. **Legal and Financial Challenges**: Despite his contributions, Ekman faced significant challenges, ultimately dying bankrupt due to a pollution lawsuit related to a quarry in Northfleet, underscoring the environmental and legal complexities associated with industrial operations.

4. **Legacy and Influence**: The sulfite process remains a critical development in the history of paper manufacturing, illustrating both the technological advancements and the socio-economic challenges of industrialization during that era.
