=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The film's production uniquely combines distinct architectural styles for its exterior and interior scenes, creating a visually compelling narrative setting.

2. **Interior Design**: Interior scenes were shot on sound stages designed in the "1890s Victorian" style, featuring elements like gas chandeliers and sconces, which contribute to an authentic period atmosphere and contrast with the exterior's modernist design.

3. **Film Poster Imagery**: The film poster showcases a "fanciful four-story Romanesque structure," which may not directly represent the actual filming locations but serves to evoke a sense of grandeur and intrigue.
