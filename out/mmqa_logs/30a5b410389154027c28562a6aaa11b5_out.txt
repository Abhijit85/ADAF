=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The design of the sign is in the public domain, allowing it to be freely used by anyone.

1. **Ownership vs. Design Rights**: YESCO owns the physical sign but does not hold the design rights, which are in the public domain. This distinction is crucial for understanding the legal use of the design.
   
2. **Public Domain Status**: The design's public domain status is attributed to Willis's intention, which means that the design can be reproduced without legal restrictions, contributing to its widespread use.

3. **Commercial Impact**: The design's ubiquity on souvenirs and other merchandise is a direct result of its public domain status, allowing businesses to capitalize on its popularity without licensing fees.

4. **Legal Clarification**: It's important to note the separation between the ownership of the physical sign and the design rights, as this affects how the design can be used commercially and legally.

This analysis is based on the consistent information provided by multiple sources, emphasizing the public domain status and its implications for commercial use.
