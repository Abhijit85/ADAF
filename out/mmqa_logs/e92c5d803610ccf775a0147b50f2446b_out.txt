=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The study examines the behavior of white sharks in the North Atlantic Ocean, particularly their interaction with anticyclonic eddies. 

1. **Depth Behavior**: White sharks spend their daytime hours at a depth of 450 meters, which suggests they may be avoiding predators or seeking prey that resides at these depths during the day.
   
2. **Nighttime Surfacing**: At night, these sharks come to the surface, possibly to feed or to regulate their body temperature, as the surface waters are warmer due to the trapping effect of anticyclonic eddies.

3. **Eddy Influence**: Anticyclonic eddies, which trap warm water, likely play a significant role in the sharks' vertical movement patterns, as the warm water could provide a more energy-efficient environment for the sharks.

4. **Study Context**: The insights are based on a 2018 study, which provides a focused look at how these oceanographic features influence the behavior of apex predators like white sharks in the North Atlantic Ocean.

The final synthesis is based on the consistent information provided by the responses, highlighting the sharks' depth behavior and the influence of anticyclonic eddies, supported by the 2018 study's findings.

Answer Echoes:
- [DEFINITION] "Anticyclonic eddies" are rotating ocean currents that trap warm water.
