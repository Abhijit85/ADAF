=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** Achieving a Grand Slam in golf, defined as winning all four major events in a single calendar year, is an exceptionally rare feat, with Bobby Jones being the only golfer to accomplish it.

1. **Historical Context:** Bobby Jones remains the sole golfer to have completed a Grand Slam, achieving this milestone in 1930. This highlights the difficulty and rarity of the accomplishment in the sport's history.

2. **Modern Era Attempts:** In the modern era, no male golfer has achieved a Grand Slam. This underscores the challenge of maintaining peak performance across all four major tournaments within a single calendar year.

3. **Tiger Woods' Achievement:** Tiger Woods won all four major tournaments consecutively within a 365-day period, but not within a single calendar year. This achievement is often referred to as the "Tiger Slam," distinguishing it from a traditional Grand Slam.

4. **Clarification:** It is crucial not to confuse Tiger Woods' consecutive wins with a traditional Grand Slam, as the latter requires victories within the same calendar year, a feat not yet replicated in the modern era.
