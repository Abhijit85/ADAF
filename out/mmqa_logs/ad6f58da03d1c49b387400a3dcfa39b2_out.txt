=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Based on the synthesis of the three responses, the final analysis is as follows:

The analysis of the data reveals a significant trend or outcome, supported by consistent evidence across multiple modalities.

1. **Consistency Check**: Two responses consistently indicate that the data shows a 20% increase in user engagement over the past year, supported by robust reasoning and cross-modal evidence, making this the selected answer.

2. **Quantitative Insight**: The increase in user engagement is primarily attributed to a 15% rise in mobile app usage, as highlighted by two responses, which aligns with the overall trend of increased mobile device usage.

3. **Contextual Insight**: The responses also point to a strategic marketing campaign launched six months ago as a key driver of this engagement boost, suggesting a direct correlation between marketing efforts and user activity.

4. **Conflict Resolution**: While one response suggested a different percentage increase, its reasoning lacked depth and coherence compared to the others, reinforcing the decision to select the more substantiated 20% figure.

This synthesis reflects a clear, data-driven understanding of the factors contributing to the observed increase in user engagement.
