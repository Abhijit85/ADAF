=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two of the three responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This consistency suggests a high likelihood of accuracy, making it the preferred choice under rule (A).

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response indicated insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. Therefore, it does not override the consistent responses from the other two agents.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Since two responses align and the third lacks a concrete answer, there is no need for conflict resolution. The consistent responses are selected based on their clarity and coherence.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer is chosen based on the consistent responses, which were supported by clear reasoning. This decision is transparent and logically consistent, directly addressing the original question by prioritizing the most robust and aligned evidence.
