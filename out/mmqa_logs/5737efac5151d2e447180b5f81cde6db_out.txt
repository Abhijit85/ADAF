=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Eurostar is a high-speed railway service that connects London with several major European cities, including Paris and Brussels, by traversing the Channel Tunnel.

1. **Geographical Reach**: Eurostar services extend beyond Paris and Brussels to include cities like Avignon, Lille, Lyon, and Marseille, providing a broad network of connections between the UK and mainland Europe.

2. **Infrastructure**: All Eurostar trains pass through the Channel Tunnel, a critical infrastructure piece owned and operated by Eurotunnel, highlighting the interdependence between Eurostar and Eurotunnel for cross-channel travel.

3. **Operational Scope**: The service is specifically designed to facilitate high-speed travel between the UK and France, with the Channel Tunnel serving as a pivotal link in this international rail network.

4. **Repetitive Context**: The information about Eurostar's routes and the Channel Tunnel's role is frequently reiterated, underscoring its importance in the context of European high-speed rail travel.

This analysis is based on consistent information from multiple sources, emphasizing Eurostar's role in connecting key European cities through the Channel Tunnel.

Answer Echoes:
