=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two of the responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This consistency suggests a high likelihood of accuracy, as multiple sources corroborate the conclusion.

2. **Fallback Rule:** In this case, the fallback rule was not necessary, as the consistent responses already provided a concrete answer with detailed evidence, eliminating the need to rely on a single response.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** The third response differed but lacked the depth and coherence found in the consistent responses. Its reasoning was less clear, making it less reliable compared to the other two.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was selected based on the consistent responses, which offered strong supporting rationale. This decision was influenced by the clarity and depth of their explanations, ensuring a logically consistent and well-supported conclusion.
