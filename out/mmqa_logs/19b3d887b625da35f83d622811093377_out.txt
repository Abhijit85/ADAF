=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Canada's metrication process is complex, influenced by historical, geographical, and social factors.

1. **Historical Influence**: Canada's measurement system is historically tied to the UK, which has led to a mixed use of metric and non-metric units. This historical connection has created a foundation where both systems coexist in various sectors.

2. **Geographical Proximity**: The close proximity to the United States, a country that predominantly uses non-metric units, has significantly impacted Canada's full transition to the metric system. This geographical factor has necessitated the continued use of non-metric units, especially in trade and commerce.

3. **Public Opposition**: There has been notable public resistance to metrication in Canada, which has slowed the transition process. This opposition reflects a cultural attachment to traditional measurement systems and a reluctance to change.

4. **Sectoral Variation**: Different sectors in Canada adopt metrication to varying degrees, with some industries fully metric while others maintain a dual system. This sectoral variation highlights the uneven adoption of metrication across the country.

The final synthesis is based on the consistent insights provided by the responses, emphasizing historical ties, geographical influence, public opposition, and sectoral differences as key factors in Canada's metrication process.
