=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The analysis focuses on the anticipated release of a TV or web series season expected in 2018, based on pre-2018 announcements.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses consistently indicate that the release was expected in 2018, supported by pre-2018 announcements. This aligns with the scope and definition provided, confirming the release timeframe.

2. **Fallback Rule:** One response suggests insufficient information due to the lack of specific series or platform details. However, the consistent evidence from the other two responses regarding the 2018 release expectation provides a concrete basis for the analysis.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** All responses agree on the 2018 release expectation, but differ in the depth of contextual details. The strongest rationale comes from the responses that emphasize the pre-2018 announcement as a reliable source of information.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer is that the series season was expected to release in 2018, based on pre-2018 announcements. This conclusion is supported by consistent evidence and reasoning from multiple responses, despite the lack of specific series or platform details.
