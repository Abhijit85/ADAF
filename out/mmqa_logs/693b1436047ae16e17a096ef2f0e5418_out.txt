=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** Jersey notes, while circulating alongside Bank of England notes in Jersey, are not considered legal tender in the UK, and their acceptance is discretionary.

1. **Legal Definitions:** Jersey notes are not "legal tender" in the UK, meaning they are not officially recognized for settling debts. However, they are considered "legal currency," which means they can be accepted but are not mandatory for transactions.

2. **Circulation Context:** In Jersey, both Jersey notes and Bank of England notes circulate together, allowing for flexibility in local transactions. This dual circulation does not extend to the UK, where Jersey notes are not automatically accepted.

3. **Acceptance in the UK:** The acceptance of Jersey notes in the UK is at the discretion of creditors. This means that while some businesses or individuals may choose to accept them, there is no obligation to do so.

4. **Practical Implications:** It is important not to assume that Jersey notes will be accepted everywhere in the UK, as their acceptance is not guaranteed and depends on individual discretion.

**Final Synthesis:** The analysis is based on the consistent information provided by at least two responses, highlighting the discretionary nature of Jersey notes' acceptance in the UK and their non-status as legal tender. This conclusion is supported by clear definitions and contextual insights regarding their circulation and acceptance.
