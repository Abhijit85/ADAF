=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The Electoral College is a constitutionally established body of electors responsible for selecting the President of the United States.

1. **Composition and Function**: The Electoral College comprises 538 electors, with a majority of 270 votes required to win the presidency. This system is rooted in the United States Constitution, highlighting its foundational role in American electoral processes.

2. **State Control**: State legislatures have the authority to determine how electors are chosen, allowing for variations in electoral processes across different states. This flexibility can lead to diverse methods of elector selection, reflecting state-specific political landscapes.

3. **District of Columbia Limitation**: The District of Columbia is limited to a maximum of three electors, ensuring it has representation in presidential elections despite not being a state. This cap maintains a balance in the distribution of electoral power.

4. **Strategic Implications**: The structure of the Electoral College can lead to strategic campaigning, as candidates often focus on swing states with significant electoral votes, potentially influencing national policy priorities.

In synthesizing the responses, the consistent emphasis on the constitutional basis, the role of state legislatures, and the strategic implications of the Electoral College informed the final analysis.
