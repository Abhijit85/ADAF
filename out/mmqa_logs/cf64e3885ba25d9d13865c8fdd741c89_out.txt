=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Circular motion refers to the movement of an object along the circumference of a circle or its rotation along a circular path. 

1. **Types of Motion**: Circular motion can be classified into two types: uniform circular motion, where the object moves with a constant angular rate, and non-uniform circular motion, where the rotation rate changes over time.
   
2. **Fixed Axis Rotation**: When an object rotates around a fixed axis, each part of the object undergoes circular motion, maintaining a consistent path relative to the axis.

3. **Physics Context**: The explanation of circular motion is rooted in physics, emphasizing the fundamental principles governing the movement of objects in circular paths.

4. **Definition Clarity**: The definition highlights the essential characteristics of circular motion, ensuring a clear understanding of its scope and application in various physical scenarios.

This analysis is based on the consistent information provided by multiple sources, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of circular motion's fundamental aspects.

Answer Echoes:
- [DEFINITION] Circular motion involves movement "along the circumference of a circle or rotation along a circular path."
- [SCOPE] It includes "uniform" motion with "constant angular rate" and "non-uniform" motion with changing rotation rates.
- [NOTE] The "rotation around a fixed axis" involves circular motion of a body's parts.
- [SOURCE] The context is derived from a physics explanation of circular motion.
- [WARNING] Avoid assuming additional details not explicitly stated in the context.
