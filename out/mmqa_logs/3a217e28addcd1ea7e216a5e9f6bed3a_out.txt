=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Jean-Félix Picard was a pioneering French astronomer and priest who made significant contributions to the measurement of the Earth's size.

1. **Accurate Measurement**: Picard conducted a survey in 1669–70 using triangulation along the Paris Meridian, determining one degree of latitude to be 110.46 km. This measurement was remarkably precise, with an error of only 0.44% compared to modern values.

2. **Instrumental Precision**: The instruments Picard used were 24 times more accurate than those available to his predecessors, allowing for unprecedented precision in his calculations.

3. **Impact on Science**: Picard's accurate measurements were crucial for Isaac Newton, who used them in developing his theory of universal gravitation, highlighting the broader scientific impact of Picard's work.

4. **Historical Context**: While Picard's work is sometimes confused with Newton's "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica," it stands independently as a foundational contribution to geodesy and astronomy. 

This analysis is based on consistent insights from multiple sources, emphasizing Picard's methodological advancements and their lasting influence on scientific progress.

Answer Echoes:
- [DEFINITION] Jean-Félix Picard was a "French astronomer and priest" known for measuring the Earth's size.
- [SCOPE] Picard's survey was conducted "in 1669–70" using triangulation along the Paris Meridian.
- [SOURCE] Picard's measurements were "110.46 km for one degree of latitude".
- [NOTE] Picard's error was "only 0.44% less than the modern value".
- [NOTE] Picard's instruments made his measurements "24 times as accurate" as previous ones.
- [SCOPE] Isaac Newton used Picard's value in his "theory of universal gravitation".
- [WARNING] Do not confuse Picard's work with Newton's "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica".
