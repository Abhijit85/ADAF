=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The development of Interface Message Processors (IMPs) by BBN was a pivotal step in the creation of the ARPANET, marking a significant milestone in networking history.

1. **Contract and Delivery:** BBN was contracted to build four IMPs, with the first delivery made to UCLA, establishing the initial node of the ARPANET.
   
2. **Terminology Confusion:** Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy sent a congratulatory telegram to BBN but mistakenly referred to the IMPs as "Interfaith Message Processor," highlighting a common misunderstanding of the technology at the time.

3. **Significance of IMPs:** The IMPs served as the backbone of the ARPANET, facilitating communication between different computers and laying the groundwork for the modern internet.

4. **Historical Context:** The successful deployment of IMPs demonstrated the feasibility of a packet-switching network, which was a revolutionary concept in the late 1960s and early 1970s, ultimately leading to the development of the global internet.

**Final Synthesis:** The consistent theme across the responses was the critical role of IMPs in the ARPANET's development, with a notable anecdote about Senator Kennedy's terminology error, underscoring the novelty and complexity of the technology at the time.

Answer Echoes:
- [DEFINITION] IMPs are "Interface Message Processors" built by BBN for ARPANET.
- [SCOPE] BBN was contracted to build four IMPs, starting with delivery to UCLA.
- [SOURCE] Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy sent a congratulatory telegram to BBN.
- [NOTE] Kennedy mistakenly called the IMPs "Interfaith Message Processor".
- [WARNING] Do not confuse "Interfaith Message Processor" with the actual IMPs.
