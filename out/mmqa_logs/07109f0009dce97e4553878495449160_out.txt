=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The episode in question reportedly reached "573 million homes," though this figure seems unusually high and warrants verification. Here are key insights:

1. **Viewership Discrepancy**: The claim of "573 million homes" as the episode's viewership is likely inaccurate, as such a number is unprecedented for television viewership, suggesting a possible error or misinterpretation in the data.

2. **Guest Performances**: The episode featured notable guest appearances, including Ryan Reynolds, which likely contributed to its viewership appeal and media attention.

3. **Mixed Reviews**: Despite the high-profile guest stars, the episode received mixed reviews, particularly critiquing its storyline and cultural references, indicating that star power alone did not guarantee critical success.

4. **Announcement Context**: The information about the episode was first revealed at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con International, a venue known for generating significant buzz and anticipation, which may have influenced initial viewership expectations.

In conclusion, while the episode had elements that could attract a large audience, the reported viewership figure is questionable and should be approached with skepticism.
