=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The "New Labour" era, initiated by Tony Blair, marked a significant transformation in the Labour Party's approach and electoral success from 1997 until the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn.

1. **Electoral Success and Decline:** Under Tony Blair, the Labour Party achieved a landslide victory in 1997 with a majority of 179 seats. However, by 2005, this majority had decreased to 66, indicating a gradual decline in electoral dominance over successive elections.

2. **Leadership Changes:** The period saw several leadership transitions, with Tony Blair being succeeded by Gordon Brown, followed by Ed Miliband, and eventually Jeremy Corbyn. Each leader brought distinct policy focuses and leadership styles, impacting the party's public perception and electoral performance.

3. **Policy Rebranding:** "New Labour" was characterized by a shift towards centrist policies, aiming to appeal to a broader electorate. This rebranding was pivotal in the initial electoral success but faced criticism over time for straying from traditional Labour values.

4. **Contextual Limitations:** The analysis does not cover developments post-Jeremy Corbyn, leaving out recent shifts and the current state of the Labour Party.

**Final Synthesis:** The selected analysis is consistent with two responses that emphasize the electoral trajectory and leadership changes during the "New Labour" era, supported by clear historical evidence. This approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the period's political dynamics.
