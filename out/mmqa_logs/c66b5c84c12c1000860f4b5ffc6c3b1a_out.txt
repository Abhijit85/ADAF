=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two of the three responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This consistency indicates a high likelihood of accuracy, as multiple sources corroborate the conclusion.

2. **Fallback Rule:** In this case, the fallback rule was not necessary, as the consistent responses already provided a concrete answer with detailed evidence, making it unnecessary to rely on a single response.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** There was no need for conflict resolution since the consistent responses aligned, reducing the need to evaluate differing answers based on reasoning quality.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was selected based on the consistent responses, which were supported by clear, coherent, and well-reasoned explanations. This approach ensures that the decision is transparent and logically consistent, directly addressing the original question.
