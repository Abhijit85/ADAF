=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check**: Two of the responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This indicates a consensus among the agents, which aligns with Rule (A) for selecting the final answer.

2. **Fallback Rule**: The third response suggested insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. Therefore, it does not override the consensus reached by the other two responses.

3. **Conflict Resolution**: Since there is no significant conflict among the responses, as two are consistent and one is inconclusive, there is no need for further conflict resolution.

4. **Final Synthesis**: The final answer is selected based on the consistent responses, which were supported by clear reasoning. This decision is transparent and logically consistent, directly addressing the original question by relying on the majority consensus and the strength of the supporting rationale.
