=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two of the responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This indicates a consensus among the agents, which aligns with Rule (A) for selecting the final answer.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response suggested insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. Therefore, it does not override the consensus reached by the other two responses.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Since there is no conflict among the responses that provided the same answer, there is no need to weigh the quality of reasoning further. The consistent responses already demonstrated clarity and coherence.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer is selected based on the agreement between two responses, which provided a clear and well-supported rationale. This decision is transparent and logically consistent, directly addressing the original question by adhering to the established rules.
