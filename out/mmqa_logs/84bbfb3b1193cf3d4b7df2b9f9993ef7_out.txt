=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two of the three responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This consistency indicates a strong likelihood that this answer is correct, as it aligns with the majority and is well-supported.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response suggested insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. Therefore, it does not outweigh the consistent responses from the other two agents.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Since two responses were consistent and well-reasoned, there was no need for conflict resolution. The consistent responses were prioritized due to their clarity and coherence.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer is based on the two consistent responses, which were selected due to their robust reasoning and alignment. This decision ensures transparency and logical consistency, directly addressing the original question with the strongest supporting rationale.
