=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Mules, the offspring of a male donkey and a female horse, are more commonly produced than hinnies, which result from a female donkey and a male horse.

1. **Ease of Production**: Mules are easier to obtain than hinnies, likely due to biological and behavioral factors that favor the mating of male donkeys with female horses over the reverse pairing.

2. **Chromosomal Differences**: Horses and donkeys have different numbers of chromosomes, which complicates hybridization and affects the fertility of the offspring, making both mules and hinnies typically sterile.

3. **F1 Hybrid Focus**: The context specifically examines F1 hybrids, which are the first-generation offspring of two different species, highlighting the unique genetic and phenotypic characteristics of mules and hinnies.

4. **Practical Implications**: The relative ease of producing mules has practical implications for agriculture and transportation, where mules are valued for their strength and endurance.

This analysis is based on the consistent information provided by multiple sources, emphasizing the biological and practical aspects of mule and hinny production.
