=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was a failed attempt by English Catholics to assassinate King James I. 

1. **Leadership and Participants**: The plot was orchestrated by Robert Catesby and involved a group of provincial English Catholics who were discontent with the king's policies towards Catholics.
   
2. **Agnes Wenman's Involvement**: Agnes Wenman, also known as Lady Wenman, was suspected of being a conspirator, though her guilt was never proven. She was an English Roman Catholic woman who died in 1617, and her involvement remains speculative.

3. **Alternative Names**: The plot is also referred to as the "Gunpowder Treason Plot" or "Jesuit Treason," highlighting its religious and political motivations.

4. **Historical Context**: The plot reflects the intense religious tensions of the time, as Catholics faced persecution under Protestant rule, leading some to resort to drastic measures.

In synthesizing the responses, the consistent theme was the uncertainty surrounding Agnes Wenman's involvement, emphasizing the need for caution in attributing guilt without definitive evidence.
