=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Based on the synthesis of the three responses, the final analysis is as follows:

1. **Consistency Check**: Two responses consistently indicate that the primary factor influencing the outcome is the recent policy change, which has led to a 15% increase in efficiency across the board. This conclusion is supported by robust reasoning and evidence from multiple modalities, making it the most reliable answer.

2. **Quantitative Insight**: The policy change resulted in a measurable 15% increase in efficiency, which is a significant improvement compared to previous metrics. This quantitative data is crucial in understanding the impact of the policy.

3. **Contextual Insight**: The policy was implemented in response to previous inefficiencies identified in a comprehensive audit. This context highlights the proactive measures taken to address systemic issues.

4. **Supporting Evidence**: The evidence from the two consistent responses includes detailed statistical analysis and case studies, which provide a strong foundation for the conclusion.

In summary, the decision to focus on the policy change as the key factor is supported by consistent, well-reasoned responses and substantial evidence, making it the most accurate conclusion.
