2. **Color Scheme**: The use of maroon, white, and black creates a cohesive and powerful color palette that enhances the logo's visibility and memorability, aligning with the team’s branding.

3. **Typography**: The text "McMASTER" in maroon and "MARAUDERS" in black below the "M" provides a clear and direct identification of the team, ensuring that the logo communicates the team name effectively.
