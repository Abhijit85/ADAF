=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two of the three responses provided the same answer with clear and robust reasoning, indicating a consensus. This consistency suggests a reliable conclusion based on the evidence presented.

2. **Fallback Rule:** In this case, the fallback rule was not necessary as the consistent responses already provided a concrete answer with detailed evidence, making it unnecessary to rely on a single response.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** There was no need for conflict resolution since two responses aligned, reducing the need to weigh differing opinions or assess the quality of reasoning across all responses.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was selected based on the agreement between two responses, which demonstrated clarity and coherence in their reasoning. This decision was influenced by the strong supporting rationale provided, ensuring a transparent and logically consistent conclusion.
