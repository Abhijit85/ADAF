=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The analysis synthesizes responses from cross-modal agents to determine the most accurate answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses agreed on a specific answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This consensus indicates a strong likelihood of accuracy, as multiple modalities corroborate the same conclusion.

2. **Fallback Rule:** In this case, the fallback rule was not necessary, as the consistent responses provided a concrete answer with detailed evidence, negating the need for reliance on a single response.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** The third response differed but lacked the depth and coherence found in the consistent responses. Its reasoning was less compelling, making it less reliable for the final synthesis.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was selected based on the agreement between two responses, which offered a well-supported rationale. This decision was influenced by the clarity and depth of their explanations, ensuring a logically consistent and evidence-backed conclusion.
