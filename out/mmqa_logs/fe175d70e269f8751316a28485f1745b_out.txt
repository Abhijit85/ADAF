=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The Arctic navigable passage, first fully traversed between 1903 and 1906, has become increasingly accessible due to declining sea ice.

1. **Historical Context**: The passage was initially navigated by explorers Robert McClure and Roald Amundsen, marking a significant milestone in Arctic exploration.
   
2. **Sea Ice Decline**: Since 2009, the reduction in Arctic sea ice has significantly improved conditions for ice navigation, making the passage more viable for regular shipping.

3. **Pre-2009 Challenges**: Before 2009, the presence of Arctic pack ice made regular shipping through the passage impractical, highlighting the impact of climate change on Arctic trade routes.

4. **Current Implications**: The improved navigability of the Arctic passage presents new opportunities for trade but also raises environmental and geopolitical concerns due to increased human activity in the region.

This analysis is based on the consistent information provided by multiple responses, emphasizing the historical significance and recent developments in Arctic navigation.

Answer Echoes:
- [DEFINITION] "Navigable passage" refers to a trade route through the Arctic.
- [SCOPE] The passage was first fully navigated from 1903 to 1906.
- [SOURCE] Robert McClure and Roald Amundsen are key explorers mentioned.
- [NOTE] Arctic sea ice decline has improved "ice navigation" since 2009.
- [WARNING] Regular shipping was not possible before 2009 due to "Arctic pack ice".
