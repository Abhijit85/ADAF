=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The Rio, a casino opened on January 15, 1990, transitioned from a locals' casino to a broader market before being acquired by Harrah's Entertainment in 1999.

1. **Initial Development**: Constructed and operated by Marnell Corrao Associates, the Rio was designed to cater primarily to local residents, establishing a strong community presence before expanding its reach.

2. **Acquisition**: In 1999, Harrah's Entertainment purchased the Rio for $888 million, marking a significant investment and indicating the casino's value and potential for growth within the broader gaming industry.

3. **Labor Organization**: Following the acquisition, the Culinary Workers Union successfully organized the Rio's employees, reflecting a shift towards more structured labor relations and potentially impacting operational dynamics.

4. **Ownership Caution**: While the data confirms Harrah's acquisition in 1999, no assumptions should be made about the current ownership or status of the Rio beyond this point, as the information is limited to that timeframe.

This analysis is based on consistent data from multiple sources, emphasizing the Rio's evolution and significant milestones up to 1999.
