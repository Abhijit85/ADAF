=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two of the three responses provided the same answer with clear and robust reasoning, indicating a consensus. This aligns with Rule A, which prioritizes consistency across responses.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response suggested insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria of Rule B, which would have prioritized a detailed answer in the absence of consensus.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Since two responses were consistent and well-reasoned, there was no need to apply Rule C. The consistent responses were coherent and provided a strong rationale, making them the preferred choice.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was selected based on the consistent and well-supported reasoning of the two agreeing responses. This decision was made transparently, adhering to the rules of consistency and evidence-based reasoning.
