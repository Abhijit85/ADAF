=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer. Here is the analysis based on the provided rules:

1. **Consistency Check**: If two or more responses agree and provide robust reasoning, that answer is selected. This ensures that the final answer is supported by multiple sources, increasing its reliability.

2. **Fallback Rule**: When two responses indicate insufficient information but one provides a concrete answer with detailed evidence, the concrete answer is chosen. This rule prioritizes specificity and evidence over uncertainty.

3. **Conflict Resolution**: In cases where all responses differ, the quality of reasoning is examined. The response with the clearest, most coherent, and in-depth explanation is selected. This approach values the strength of the argument over mere consensus.

4. **Final Synthesis**: The final answer is presented with a summary of the key points that influenced the decision. This step ensures transparency and logical consistency, directly addressing the original question and providing a clear rationale for the chosen answer.
