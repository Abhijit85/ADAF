=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check**: Two responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning, indicating a consensus. This aligns with Rule (A), which prioritizes consistency across responses.

2. **Fallback Rule**: The third response suggested insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. Therefore, Rule (B) does not apply, as the concrete answer from the other responses is more reliable.

3. **Conflict Resolution**: Since two responses were consistent and well-reasoned, there was no need for conflict resolution under Rule (C). The consistent responses were selected based on their clarity and coherence.

4. **Final Synthesis**: The final answer was chosen based on the consistent and well-supported reasoning of the two aligned responses. This decision was influenced by the clear, logical explanations provided, ensuring a transparent and consistent conclusion.
