=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In synthesizing the responses from the cross-modal synthesis agents, the final analysis is as follows:

1. **Consistency Check**: Two responses consistently indicated that the available information was insufficient to provide a definitive answer. Both responses highlighted the lack of specific data points and contextual details necessary to draw a concrete conclusion.

2. **Fallback Rule**: The third response offered a concrete answer, supported by detailed evidence. It provided a comprehensive analysis of the available data, including statistical trends and contextual factors, which were not addressed in the other responses.

3. **Conflict Resolution**: Despite the initial consensus on insufficient information, the third response's depth and clarity in reasoning were compelling. It presented a well-structured argument, integrating quantitative data with contextual insights, thereby offering a more complete picture.

4. **Final Synthesis**: Based on the robust rationale and detailed evidence provided in the third response, the final answer adopts its conclusion. This decision is driven by the response's ability to effectively synthesize available data and context, offering a coherent and substantiated analysis.
