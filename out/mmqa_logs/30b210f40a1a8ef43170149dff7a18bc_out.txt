=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The little finger, also known as the pinky finger or fourth digit, is the smallest and most ulnar finger on the human hand.

1. **Position and Size**: The little finger is located opposite the thumb and next to the ring finger, making it the most ulnar and smallest finger on the hand. This specific position and size help distinguish it from other fingers.

2. **Anatomical Context**: In human anatomy, the little finger plays a crucial role in hand function, contributing to grip strength and dexterity, despite its small size.

3. **Terminology**: The terms "pinky finger" and "fourth digit" are synonymous with "little finger," highlighting its common usage in both casual and scientific contexts.

4. **Identification Caution**: It is important to avoid confusing the little finger with other fingers due to its unique position and size, which are key identifiers.

This analysis is based on consistent information from multiple sources, emphasizing the little finger's anatomical and functional significance.
