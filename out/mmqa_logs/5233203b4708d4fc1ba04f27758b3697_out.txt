=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The camera obscura, an early optical device, is first documented in the writings of Mozi, a Han Chinese philosopher, offering a remarkably early and correct explanation of the phenomenon.

1. **Historical Context**: Mozi's writings are the earliest known records of the camera obscura, predating other known examples by several centuries, highlighting the advanced understanding of optics in ancient China.

2. **Technical Insight**: The camera obscura involves the inversion of images through a pinhole that collects light rays, a concept accurately described by Mozi, demonstrating a sophisticated grasp of light behavior.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: No other examples of the camera obscura are known before the 11th century, underscoring the uniqueness and pioneering nature of Mozi's work in the context of global scientific history.

4. **Philosophical Implications**: As a philosopher, Mozi's exploration of the camera obscura reflects a broader intellectual curiosity and a methodical approach to understanding natural phenomena, which was ahead of its time.

This analysis is based on the consistent and robust reasoning provided by two responses, which highlighted Mozi's pioneering contribution to the understanding of optical principles.

Answer Echoes:
- [DEFINITION] "Camera obscura" involves image inversion through a "pinhole" collecting light rays.
