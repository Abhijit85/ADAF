=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Apollo 11 marked a historic milestone as the first manned mission to land on the Moon. Here are key insights:

1. **Duration on Lunar Surface**: Astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin spent approximately 21.5 hours on the Moon, conducting experiments and collecting samples, which was a significant achievement in human space exploration.

2. **Lunar Module**: The lunar module, named "Eagle," was crucial for the mission's success, facilitating the astronauts' descent to the Moon's surface and their subsequent return to the command module.

3. **First Moonwalk**: Neil Armstrong made history by stepping onto the Moon on July 21, 1969, at 02:56:15 UTC, delivering the iconic phrase, "That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind."

4. **Module Distinction**: It is important to distinguish between the command module "Columbia," which orbited the Moon, and the lunar module "Eagle," which landed on the lunar surface.

This analysis is based on consistent information from multiple sources, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of Apollo 11's key aspects.

Answer Echoes:
- [DEFINITION] Apollo 11 was the first manned Moon landing mission.
- [SCOPE] Armstrong and Aldrin spent "21.5 hours on the lunar surface".
- [SOURCE] The lunar module was named "Eagle".
- [NOTE] Armstrong stepped onto the Moon on July 21 at 02:56:15 UTC.
- [WARNING] Do not confuse the command module Columbia with the lunar module Eagle.
