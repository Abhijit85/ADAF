=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The four divisions of society (shinōkōshō) in Tokugawa Japan were a hierarchical system influenced by Confucian philosophy, prioritizing agriculture and justifying the ruling class.

1. **Confucian Influence**: The system was rooted in Confucian ideas from China, which emphasized the importance of agriculture as the foundation of a stable society.
   
2. **Samurai at the Top**: Samurai were placed at the top of the hierarchy to legitimize their ruling status, reflecting the political and military power they held during this period.

3. **Peasants' Value**: Peasants were ranked second, highlighting the essential role of food production in sustaining society, aligning with Confucian values that prioritized agriculture.

4. **Artisans and Merchants**: Artisans and merchants were considered lower in the hierarchy because they produced nonessential goods, which were seen as less critical to the survival and stability of society.

This analysis is based on consistent insights from multiple responses, emphasizing the Confucian basis and the societal roles within the hierarchy.
