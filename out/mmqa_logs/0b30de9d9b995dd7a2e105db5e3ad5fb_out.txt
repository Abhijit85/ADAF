=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In synthesizing the responses from the cross-modal synthesis agents, the final analysis is as follows:

1. **Consistency Check**: Two responses consistently indicated that the data shows a significant increase in user engagement on the platform over the past year, supported by robust reasoning and evidence from user activity logs and survey data.

2. **Quantitative Insight**: The platform experienced a 25% increase in active users, with a notable 30% rise in daily interactions per user, as corroborated by both user analytics and feedback reports.

3. **Contextual Insight**: The increase in engagement is attributed to the introduction of new interactive features and a targeted marketing campaign, which were highlighted in two responses as key drivers of user interest and retention.

4. **Conflict Resolution**: The third response suggested insufficient data to draw conclusions, but lacked the depth and coherence found in the other two responses, which provided detailed evidence and clear reasoning.

The final decision is based on the consistency and strength of the evidence presented in the first two responses, which clearly demonstrate a positive trend in user engagement.
