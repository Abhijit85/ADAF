=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses agreed on a specific answer, providing clear and robust reasoning. This alignment suggests a high level of confidence in the accuracy of the information presented.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response indicated insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. Therefore, it does not outweigh the consistent responses from the other two agents.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Since there was no significant conflict among the responses, the decision was straightforward. The two consistent responses were selected based on their clarity and depth of reasoning.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was chosen based on the agreement between two responses, which offered coherent and well-supported reasoning. This approach ensures that the decision is transparent, logically consistent, and directly addresses the original question.
