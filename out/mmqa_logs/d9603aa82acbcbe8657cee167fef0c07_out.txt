=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses agreed on a specific answer, both providing clear and robust reasoning. This alignment suggests a high level of confidence in the accuracy of the answer, making it the preferred choice according to Rule A.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response indicated insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. Therefore, it does not override the consistent responses from the other two agents.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Since there was no complete disagreement among all three responses, the need for conflict resolution was minimal. The consistent responses were already supported by strong reasoning, making them the most reliable.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was selected based on the agreement and robust reasoning of two responses. This decision was influenced by the clarity and coherence of their explanations, ensuring a logically consistent and well-supported conclusion.
