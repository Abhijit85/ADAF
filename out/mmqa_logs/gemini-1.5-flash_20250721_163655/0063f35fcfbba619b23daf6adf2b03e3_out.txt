=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Is the title of the Eric Loren 1998 film based on a book?

**Factual Answer**:  Based on the provided filmography and text describing the production of "Saving Private Ryan," it is unclear whether the film is based on a book. While the text mentions the film is loosely based on the stories of the Niland brothers, it does not cite a specific book as its source. The filmography data confirms Eric Loren's role in the 1998 film but lacks information regarding its source material.  Further research using external sources such as IMDb or the film's credits would be needed to definitively answer this question.

**Source**: Combined (text and data)

**Confidence**: Low
