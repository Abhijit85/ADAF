=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The "Pelican Brief" is a document that uncovers a conspiracy involving high-level political intrigue, crime, and investigative journalism.

1. **Key Evidence**: The conspiracy is substantiated by "documents and a videotape" found in Morgan's box, which are crucial in linking Mattiece to the assassination of the Justices.
   
2. **Darby's Role**: Darby, the creator of the "Pelican Brief," plays a central role in exposing the conspiracy but faces significant danger, narrowly escaping death from a "car bomb."

3. **Government Involvement**: The investigation involves both the FBI and CIA, highlighting the complexity and high stakes of the situation. However, the President's directive for the FBI to "back off" suggests political interference.

4. **Investigative Challenges**: The involvement of multiple agencies and the President's interference indicate significant obstacles in pursuing justice, underscoring the tension between political power and legal accountability.

This analysis is based on the consistent evidence provided by the sources, emphasizing the critical role of Darby's document and the political dynamics at play.
