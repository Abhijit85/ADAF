=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In synthesizing the responses from the cross-modal synthesis agents, the final analysis is as follows:

1. **Consistency Check**: Two responses consistently indicated that the data supports a significant increase in the adoption of renewable energy sources over the past decade, citing robust evidence from multiple studies and statistical reports. This consistency in findings and reasoning led to the selection of this conclusion as the final answer.

2. **Quantitative Insight**: The responses highlighted a 30% increase in global renewable energy capacity from 2010 to 2020, with solar and wind energy being the primary contributors. This quantitative data was consistently supported by evidence from international energy agencies.

3. **Contextual Insight**: The analysis pointed out that government policies and technological advancements have been pivotal in driving this growth. Subsidies, tax incentives, and international agreements like the Paris Accord were frequently mentioned as key factors.

4. **Conflict Resolution**: Although one response suggested insufficient data, the detailed evidence provided by the other two responses, including specific case studies and policy analyses, offered a more compelling and coherent rationale, leading to the final synthesis.

This decision-making process was guided by the consistency and depth of the evidence presented, ensuring a transparent and logical conclusion.
