=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Sycorax, though absent in the play, significantly influences its events and relationships. 

1. **Background and Influence**: Sycorax was banished from Algiers, and her presence is felt through her son, Caliban, who claims the island due to his filial connection to her. This establishes a foundational conflict over the island's ownership and legacy.

2. **Temporal Context**: The play unfolds several years after Sycorax's death, yet her past actions and reputation continue to shape the narrative, particularly through the characters' interactions and motivations.

3. **Character Dynamics**: Prospero manipulates Ariel by referencing Sycorax's cruel treatment, using her as a tool to exert control and maintain power dynamics on the island.

4. **Enduring Impact**: Despite her physical absence, Sycorax's influence permeates the play, affecting several relationships and driving the plot, highlighting the enduring power of her legacy and the complexities of inheritance and authority.

This analysis is based on consistent insights from multiple responses, emphasizing Sycorax's lasting impact on the play's events and character relationships.
