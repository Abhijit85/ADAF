=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The filming of a project initially planned in the UAE was relocated to Morocco due to the Emirati authorities' refusal to grant clearance.

1. **Relocation and Timing**: Filming was moved to Morocco, specifically to Sidi Kaouki and Amanjena, after the UAE denied permission. This relocation led to an extension of the filming schedule from the planned 13 days to nearly six weeks.

2. **Timeline**: The filming in Morocco was documented to have taken place in November 2009, indicating a significant shift in the production timeline due to the relocation.

3. **Repeated Information**: There is a notable repetition in the available information regarding the postponement and relocation of the filming, emphasizing the impact of the initial denial of clearance on the production process.

The decision to focus on Morocco for filming, despite the initial plans for the UAE, highlights the adaptability of the production team in response to logistical challenges. The extended schedule underscores the complexities involved in such a significant change of location.
