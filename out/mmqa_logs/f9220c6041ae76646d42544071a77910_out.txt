=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Marine One, the President's helicopter, lands on the south lawn of the White House, which is specially prepared for such operations.

1. **Landing Infrastructure**: The south lawn is equipped with three removable aluminum discs that accommodate the helicopter's landing gear, ensuring stability during landings.
   
2. **Aesthetic Considerations**: Despite the functional need for a helipad, the lawn does not feature a full helipad to maintain the aesthetic appeal of the area, balancing functionality with visual considerations.

3. **Operational Scope**: The use of the south lawn for helicopter landings highlights its strategic importance in facilitating presidential travel, underscoring the need for both practical and aesthetic solutions in high-profile locations.

In synthesizing the responses, the consistent emphasis on the use of removable discs for landing gear and the absence of a full helipad for aesthetic reasons were key points. These insights were corroborated by at least two responses, providing a clear and robust rationale for the final analysis.

Answer Echoes:
