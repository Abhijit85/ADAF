=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The 2009 German federal elections resulted in a shift towards a center-right government coalition.

1. **Election Date and Outcome**: The elections for the 17th Bundestag were held on 27 September 2009. The Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Christian Social Union (CSU), and Free Democratic Party (FDP) announced their intention to form a new center-right government following the election results.

2. **Political Shift**: This coalition marked a significant political shift, as it moved away from the previous grand coalition between the CDU/CSU and the Social Democratic Party (SPD), which had governed since 2005.

3. **Leadership Context**: Angela Merkel, from the CDU, continued as Chancellor, leading the new coalition. It is important not to confuse her leadership period with that of Helmut Kohl, who served as Chancellor from 1982 to 1998.

4. **Strategic Implications**: The formation of this coalition indicated a strategic alignment towards more market-oriented policies, reflecting the FDP's influence within the government.

This analysis is based on the consistent information provided by the majority of responses, emphasizing the election's outcome and its political implications.
