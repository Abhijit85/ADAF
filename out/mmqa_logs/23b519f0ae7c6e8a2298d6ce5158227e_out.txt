=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The analysis synthesizes insights from three cross-modal responses to determine the most accurate answer to a given question.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses consistently indicated that the available information was insufficient to provide a definitive answer. Both responses highlighted the lack of specific data points and contextual details necessary to draw a concrete conclusion.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response offered a concrete answer, supported by detailed evidence. It provided a comprehensive analysis of the available data, including statistical trends and contextual factors, which were not addressed in the other responses.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Despite the initial consensus on insufficient information, the third response's depth and clarity in reasoning were compelling. It presented a well-structured argument, integrating quantitative data with contextual insights, which enhanced its credibility.

4. **Final Synthesis:** Based on the Fallback Rule, the concrete answer from the third response is selected as the final answer. Its robust evidence and coherent rationale outweighed the lack of consensus, providing a more informed and reliable conclusion.
