=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The course record, defined as the lowest score achieved on a specific golf course, was matched by two golfers a decade apart, demonstrating sustained excellence in performance.

1. **Consistency in Performance:** Both golfers achieved the same score, underscoring a consistent level of high performance over a ten-year span. This suggests that the course's difficulty level has remained stable, allowing for comparable achievements across different time periods.

2. **Historical Context:** The information likely comes from historical sports records or golf tournament data, indicating that these performances are well-documented and recognized within the golfing community.

3. **Course-Specific Achievement:** The record is specific to a particular golf course, emphasizing the importance of course conditions and layout in achieving such scores. This specificity highlights the unique challenges and characteristics of the course that both golfers successfully navigated.

4. **Documentation and Verification:** The need to identify the course name when linking to specific Wikipedia entries suggests the importance of accurate documentation and verification of these records, ensuring that they are correctly attributed and preserved for historical reference.
