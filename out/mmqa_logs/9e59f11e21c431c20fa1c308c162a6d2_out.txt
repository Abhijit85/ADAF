=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Mastodons, specifically the species M. americanum, were prehistoric creatures resembling elephants and mammoths but were distinct in their lineage and physical characteristics.

1. **Physical Characteristics**: Mastodons had shorter legs and a longer body compared to mammoths, and they were more heavily muscled, which contributed to their robust appearance. This information is derived from modern reconstructions based on partial and skeletal remains.

2. **Size and Weight**: Large male mastodons could grow up to 3.25 meters (10.7 feet) tall and weigh as much as 11 tonnes, highlighting their massive size and strength.

3. **Distinct Lineage**: Despite visual similarities to elephants and mammoths, mastodons were not closely related to either, emphasizing the importance of not confusing these species based solely on appearance.

4. **Research Basis**: The insights into mastodons are primarily based on modern reconstructions, which rely on the analysis of available skeletal remains, underscoring the scientific methods used to understand these ancient creatures.

This analysis is based on consistent information from multiple responses, emphasizing the distinct physical and lineage characteristics of mastodons.

Answer Echoes:
- [DEFINITION] Mastodons were similar in appearance to elephants and mammoths but not closely related.
- [SCOPE] The context focuses on the species M. americanum, detailing size and physical characteristics.
- [SOURCE] Information is based on "modern reconstructions" from "partial and skeletal remains".
- [NOTE] Mastodons had "shorter legs, a longer body" and were "more heavily muscled" than mammoths.
- [NOTE] Large males could reach up to "3.25 metres (10.7 ft) tall" and weigh "11 tonnes".
- [WARNING] Do not confuse mastodons with elephants or mammoths despite visual similarities.
