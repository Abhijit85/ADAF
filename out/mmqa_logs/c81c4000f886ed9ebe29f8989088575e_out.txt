=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Final Answer:**

Nigeria, the most populous African country, has a complex religious demographic landscape characterized by significant regional differences and data inconsistencies.

1. **Population Overview**: As of 2015, Nigeria had over 182 million people, making it the most populous country in Africa. This large population contributes to the complexity of its religious demographics.

2. **Religious Demographics**: The Pew Forum's 2010 report is a key source for understanding Nigeria's religious composition, though the exact ratio of Christians to Muslims remains uncertain. This uncertainty is compounded by varying survey results, highlighting potential data inconsistencies.

3. **Regional Distribution**: The majority of Nigerian Muslims are Sunni, predominantly residing in the northern region, while Christians are primarily concentrated in the south. This regional distribution underscores the country's religious diversity and potential for regional tensions.

4. **Data Challenges**: Different surveys report varying religious percentages, indicating inconsistencies in data collection and interpretation. This variability complicates efforts to accurately assess the religious landscape in Nigeria.

**Explanation**: This synthesis draws on consistent insights from the responses, emphasizing Nigeria's large population, regional religious distribution, and the challenges posed by inconsistent data. The analysis is supported by the Pew Forum's report and highlights the need for careful interpretation of religious demographic data in Nigeria.
