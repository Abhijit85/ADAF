=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Alabama is home to a diverse array of indigenous reptile species, totaling 93, excluding subspecies.

1. **Species Breakdown**: The state's reptilian fauna includes one species of crocodilian, 12 species of lizards, 49 species of snakes, and 31 species of turtles. This highlights the significant diversity within the snake and turtle populations.

2. **Extirpation Concerns**: Three species are possibly extirpated from Alabama: the eastern indigo snake, the southern hognose snake, and the mimic glass lizard. This indicates potential conservation challenges and the need for habitat protection and restoration efforts.

3. **Exclusion of Subspecies**: The count of 93 species does not include subspecies, suggesting that the actual diversity might be higher if subspecies were considered. This exclusion is crucial for understanding the full scope of biodiversity.

4. **Conservation Implications**: The potential extirpation of certain species underscores the importance of conservation initiatives to protect and possibly reintroduce these species to maintain ecological balance.

The final synthesis was based on the consistent information provided by the responses, which highlighted the species count, potential extirpation, and the exclusion of subspecies, all supported by clear reasoning.
