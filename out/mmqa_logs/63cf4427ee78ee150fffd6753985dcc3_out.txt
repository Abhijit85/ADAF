=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of AFL's equalisation policies reveals their impact on team performance and competition balance. 

1. **Historical Success**: Essendon and Carlton have each won 16 VFL/AFL premierships, highlighting their historical dominance in the league. This suggests that while equalisation policies aim to level the playing field, historical success and established club culture still play significant roles.

2. **Recent Competitiveness**: Since 1990, thirteen different clubs have won a premiership, indicating a more competitive environment in recent decades. This suggests that equalisation policies may have contributed to a more balanced competition.

3. **Preliminary Final Participation**: Every current AFL team, except Gold Coast, has reached a preliminary final, demonstrating that most teams have been competitive at high levels, aligning with the goals of equalisation policies.

4. **Premiership Gaps**: Fremantle, Gold Coast, and Greater Western Sydney have yet to win a premiership, indicating that while equalisation policies have increased competitiveness, some newer or less successful teams still face challenges in achieving ultimate success.

This analysis is based on the consistency of responses regarding the impact of equalisation policies on competition balance and team success.
