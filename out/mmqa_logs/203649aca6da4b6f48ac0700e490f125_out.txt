=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on given rules.

1. **Consistency Check**: Two responses provided the same answer with clear and robust reasoning, indicating a consensus. This aligns with Rule (A), which prioritizes consistency across responses.

2. **Fallback Rule**: The third response suggested insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence, making it less compelling compared to the consistent responses.

3. **Conflict Resolution**: Since there was no significant conflict among the responses, as two were consistent, there was no need to deeply analyze the quality of reasoning for conflict resolution.

4. **Final Synthesis**: The final answer is based on the consistent responses, which were selected due to their clear and robust reasoning. This decision was influenced by the alignment of these responses with the rules, ensuring a transparent and logically consistent conclusion.
