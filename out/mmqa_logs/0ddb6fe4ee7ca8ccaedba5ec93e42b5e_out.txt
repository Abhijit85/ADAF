=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In synthesizing the responses from the cross-modal synthesis agents, the final analysis focuses on the most consistent and well-supported insights.

1. **Consistency Check**: Two responses consistently highlighted the importance of robust reasoning in decision-making, emphasizing that clear and logical explanations are crucial for selecting the final answer. This consistency in reasoning was a key factor in determining the final synthesis.

2. **Fallback Rule**: One response provided a concrete answer with detailed evidence, suggesting that when information is insufficient, a well-supported concrete answer should be prioritized. This approach ensures that decisions are based on the best available evidence.

3. **Conflict Resolution**: In cases where all responses differed, the quality of reasoning was the deciding factor. The response with the most coherent and in-depth explanation was selected, demonstrating the importance of clarity and depth in resolving conflicts.

4. **Final Synthesis**: The final decision was made by weighing the consistency and quality of reasoning across responses, ensuring a transparent and logically consistent conclusion that directly addresses the original question.
