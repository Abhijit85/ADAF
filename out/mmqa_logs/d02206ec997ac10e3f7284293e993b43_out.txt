=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The apple in question is a type of cooking apple known for its firm texture and tart flavor, making it ideal for baking.

1. **Texture and Flavor**: The apple is described as having a "hard" texture with "crisp, juicy flesh," which is complemented by its "tart and acidic" flavor. These characteristics make it particularly suitable for cooking applications.

2. **Culinary Use**: Its ability to "remain firm when baked" is a significant advantage for culinary uses, especially in making pies, where maintaining structure is crucial.

3. **Ripeness Indicator**: The apple's skin turns "yellow when overripe," serving as a visual cue for quality assessment, which is important for both consumers and chefs to ensure optimal taste and texture.

4. **Final Decision**: The consistent emphasis across responses on the apple's suitability for cooking, particularly baking, due to its firm texture and tart flavor, supports the conclusion that it is a cooking apple. This decision is based on the clear and robust reasoning provided by multiple sources.
