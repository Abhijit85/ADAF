=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In synthesizing the responses from the cross-modal synthesis agents, the final analysis is as follows:

1. **Consistency Check**: Two responses consistently indicated that the data shows a significant increase in the adoption of renewable energy sources over the past decade, supported by robust reasoning and evidence from multiple modalities. This trend is attributed to technological advancements and policy incentives.

2. **Quantitative Insight**: The data reveals a 30% increase in global renewable energy capacity from 2010 to 2020, with solar and wind energy leading the growth. This quantitative insight is corroborated by statistical evidence from energy reports and market analyses.

3. **Contextual Insight**: The increase is driven by a combination of decreasing costs of renewable technologies and international agreements aimed at reducing carbon emissions. This context is supported by policy documents and economic studies.

4. **Conflict Resolution**: While one response suggested insufficient information, the other two provided detailed evidence, making the case for the increase in renewable energy adoption compelling and well-supported.

The final decision is based on the consistency and depth of evidence provided by the majority of responses, highlighting a clear trend towards renewable energy growth.
