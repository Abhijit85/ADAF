=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Kopi luwak, also known as civet coffee, is a unique type of coffee made from part-digested coffee cherries eaten and excreted by the Asian palm civet.

1. **Definition and Process**: Kopi luwak is produced when the Asian palm civet consumes coffee cherries, which are then fermented during digestion and excreted. This process is believed to enhance the flavor profile of the coffee.

2. **Geographical Context**: The term "kopi luwak" is derived from the Indonesian language, indicating the coffee's strong association with Indonesia, where the Asian palm civet is commonly found.

3. **Market Perception**: Despite its unique production method, the context does not address any ethical or quality concerns, which are often associated with kopi luwak due to animal welfare issues and potential quality inconsistencies.

4. **Terminology**: The coffee is also referred to as "civet coffee," highlighting its connection to the civet's role in the production process.

This analysis is based on consistent information from multiple sources, focusing on the definition, process, and cultural context of kopi luwak.
