=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two of the responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This indicates a consensus among the agents, which aligns with Rule (A) for selecting the final answer.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response suggested insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Rule (B), reinforcing the selection of the consistent answer from the other two responses.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Since there was no significant conflict among the responses, as two were consistent, there was no need to apply Rule (C) for conflict resolution.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was chosen based on the consistency and clarity of reasoning in the two matching responses. This decision was made transparently by adhering to the rules, ensuring logical consistency and directly addressing the original question.
