=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The Sony BDZ-S77, released in 2003, was the first consumer Blu-ray device, but its impact was initially limited due to several factors.

1. **Market Limitation**: The device was only available in Japan, which restricted its market reach and potential global influence at the time of its release.
   
2. **DRM Challenges**: Hollywood studios required new digital rights management (DRM) systems for Blu-ray movie releases, as the previous CSS system used for DVDs had failed. This led to no movies being initially available for the Sony BDZ-S77, further limiting its utility and appeal to consumers.

3. **Industry Developments**: The formation of the Blu-ray Disc Association (BDA) in 2004, evolving from the Blu-ray Disc Founders, marked a significant step in standardizing and promoting Blu-ray technology. The inclusion of major studios like 20th Century Fox on the BDA's Board of Directors underscored the industry's commitment to overcoming initial hurdles and advancing the Blu-ray format.

These factors collectively highlight the initial challenges faced by the Sony BDZ-S77 in establishing Blu-ray technology in the consumer market.
