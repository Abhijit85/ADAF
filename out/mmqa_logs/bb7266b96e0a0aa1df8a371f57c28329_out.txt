=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The bird in the image is likely a wagtail, identified by its distinct coloration and long tail.

1. **Distinct Coloration:** The bird's grey and white body, along with a black patch on its throat, aligns with common characteristics of wagtails, which often have contrasting color patterns.

2. **Long Tail:** The bird's long tail is a significant identifying feature, as wagtails are known for their elongated tails, which they often wag up and down.

3. **Natural Habitat:** The blurred background with hints of water and grass suggests a natural setting typical for wagtails, which are often found near water bodies.

4. **Consistency Across Responses:** Two responses consistently identified the bird as a wagtail based on its physical characteristics and habitat context, providing robust reasoning that aligns with known wagtail traits.

**Final Synthesis:** The consistent identification of the bird as a wagtail, supported by its distinct coloration, long tail, and natural habitat, provides a clear and logical conclusion.
