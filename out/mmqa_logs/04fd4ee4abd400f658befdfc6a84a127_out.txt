=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on a set of rules.

1. **Consistency Check**: If at least two responses agree and provide robust reasoning, that answer is selected. This ensures that the final answer is supported by multiple sources, enhancing its reliability.

2. **Fallback Rule**: When two responses indicate insufficient information but one provides a concrete answer with detailed evidence, the concrete answer is chosen. This prioritizes specificity and evidence over uncertainty.

3. **Conflict Resolution**: If all responses differ, the decision is based on the quality of reasoning. The response with the clearest, most coherent, and in-depth explanation is selected, ensuring that the final answer is well-supported and logical.

4. **Final Synthesis**: The chosen answer is accompanied by a summary of key points that influenced the decision. This step ensures transparency and logical consistency, directly addressing the original question and providing a clear rationale for the final answer.
