=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses agreed on a specific answer, both providing clear and robust reasoning. This alignment suggests a high level of confidence in the accuracy of the information presented.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response indicated insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. Therefore, it does not outweigh the consistent responses from the other two agents.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Since there was no direct conflict among all three responses, the need for conflict resolution was minimal. The agreement between two responses simplifies the decision-making process.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer is selected based on the consistent agreement of two responses, supported by clear reasoning. This approach ensures that the decision is transparent, logically consistent, and directly addresses the original question, providing a reliable conclusion.
