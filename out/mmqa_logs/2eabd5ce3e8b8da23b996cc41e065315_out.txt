=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Ligers, the hybrid offspring of male lions and female tigers, are notably larger than their parent species. 

1. **Size Comparison**: Ligers can grow significantly larger than both lions and tigers, often surpassing them in weight and size. This is a key characteristic that distinguishes them from their parent species.

2. **Reported Weight**: A liger named 'Nook' reportedly weighs over 550 kg, although this figure has not been independently verified. This highlights the potential for ligers to reach extraordinary sizes, though such reports should be approached with caution.

3. **Contextual Insight**: The size of ligers is a result of hybrid vigor, where the combination of genes from both parent species leads to enhanced growth. This phenomenon is not universally applicable to all ligers, as individual growth can vary.

4. **Cautionary Note**: While 'Nook's' weight is impressive, it may not represent the average size of all ligers, emphasizing the need for more comprehensive data to understand the typical size range of this hybrid species.
