=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The analysis synthesizes insights from three cross-modal responses to determine the most accurate answer to a given question, following a structured decision-making process.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses consistently indicated that the available information was insufficient to provide a definitive answer. Both responses highlighted the lack of comprehensive data and the need for further evidence to draw a reliable conclusion.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response provided a concrete answer, supported by detailed evidence. It presented a well-structured argument, citing specific data points and contextual factors that were not addressed by the other responses.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Despite the differing conclusions, the third response demonstrated superior reasoning. It offered a clear, coherent explanation, effectively integrating quantitative data with contextual insights to support its conclusion.

4. **Final Synthesis:** Based on the Fallback Rule and the quality of reasoning, the concrete answer from the third response is selected as the final answer. This decision is supported by its detailed evidence and logical coherence, which outweigh the lack of consensus among the other responses.
