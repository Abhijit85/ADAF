=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The analysis synthesizes responses from cross-modal agents to determine the most accurate answer to a given question, focusing on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses provided the same answer with robust reasoning, indicating a consensus. This consistency suggests reliability in the conclusion drawn by these agents.

2. **Fallback Rule:** In cases where information was deemed insufficient by two responses, the third response offered a concrete answer supported by detailed evidence. This suggests that the third response had access to or interpreted the data more effectively.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** When all three responses differed, the decision was based on the quality of reasoning. The response with the clearest, most coherent, and in-depth explanation was selected, ensuring that the final answer was well-supported.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was chosen based on a transparent and logical evaluation of the responses, ensuring that the decision directly addressed the original question with the strongest supporting rationale.
