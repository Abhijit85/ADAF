=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The Indiana Supreme Court, established in 1816, marked a significant development in the state's judicial system.

1. **Historical Context**: The court was created with Indiana's statehood, replacing the General Court of the Indiana Territory, and held its first session in Corydon on May 5, 1817. This transition signified Indiana's shift from a territorial to a state judicial framework.

2. **Appointment Process**: Justices were appointed by the governor, requiring the "advice and consent" of the senate, reflecting a system of checks and balances intended to ensure qualified judicial appointments.

3. **Term Length**: Under the 1816 constitution, justices served seven-year terms, which provided a balance between judicial independence and accountability, allowing for periodic review of their performance.

This analysis is based on consistent information from multiple sources, highlighting the court's foundational role in Indiana's legal history and its structured approach to judicial appointments and terms.
