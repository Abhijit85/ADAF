=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The Alliance of American Football (AAF) was a professional American football league that aimed to complement the NFL with a spring schedule.

1. **League Structure**: The AAF consisted of eight teams, each with a roster of 52 players. The league was designed to provide additional opportunities for players, coaches, and officials to develop their skills.

2. **Operational Timeline**: The league was launched in 2019 but faced financial difficulties, leading to its suspension after just eight weeks of play. This abrupt end highlighted the challenges of establishing a new sports league in a competitive market.

3. **Financial Challenges**: Despite initial investments and partnerships, the AAF struggled with funding, which was exacerbated by lower-than-expected viewership and revenue. This financial instability was a critical factor in its premature closure.

4. **Market Positioning**: The AAF sought to fill the football offseason gap, targeting fans eager for more football content. However, it faced stiff competition from established sports and entertainment options, which limited its market penetration and growth potential.
