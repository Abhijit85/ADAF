=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Jason Kidd's performance on shots taken from beyond half-court during his career is a specific and limited aspect of his overall basketball abilities. 

1. **Performance Data**: Kidd made 4 out of 44 attempts from beyond half-court, resulting in a success rate of approximately 10%. This statistic highlights the difficulty of making such long-distance shots, even for a skilled player like Kidd.

2. **Definition and Scope**: The term "beyond half-court" refers to shots taken from more than halfway across the basketball court, and the data encompasses Kidd's entire career performance in this specific context.

3. **Contextual Insight**: While Kidd's success rate for these shots is roughly 10%, this should not be generalized to his overall shooting abilities, as these attempts are exceptionally challenging and not representative of typical gameplay scenarios.

4. **Cautionary Note**: The statistic serves as an interesting footnote in Kidd's career but should be interpreted with caution, as it does not reflect his overall skill set or shooting proficiency in more conventional situations.

**Final Synthesis**: The analysis is based on consistent data from multiple responses, emphasizing the specificity of the statistic and its limited applicability to Kidd's broader basketball skills.
