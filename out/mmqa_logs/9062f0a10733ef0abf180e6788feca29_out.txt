=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two of the three responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This consistency suggests a high likelihood of accuracy, making it the preferred choice under rule (A).

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response indicated insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for selection under rule (B).

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Since two responses were consistent and well-reasoned, there was no need to resolve conflicts among differing answers. The consistent responses were prioritized due to their clarity and coherence.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was selected based on the agreement between two responses, which demonstrated strong supporting rationale. This decision was influenced by the clear, logical reasoning and the alignment of evidence across modalities, ensuring a transparent and consistent conclusion.
