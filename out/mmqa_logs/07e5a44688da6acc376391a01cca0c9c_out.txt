=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The Divergent film series, consisting of three movies released between 2014 and 2016, grossed over $765 million worldwide.

1. **Box Office Performance**: "Divergent" grossed over $288 million, "Insurgent" surpassed it with over $297 million, while "Allegiant" saw a significant drop, earning $179 million. This indicates a declining trend in box office performance over the series.
   
2. **Technological Advancement**: "Insurgent" was the first in the series to be released in IMAX 3D, which may have contributed to its higher earnings compared to the first film, as it offered a more immersive viewing experience.

3. **Overall Series Impact**: Despite the decline in revenue with "Allegiant," the series collectively grossed a substantial amount, highlighting its initial popularity and the strong fan base it garnered.

4. **Market Dynamics**: The decreasing revenue trend suggests potential factors such as audience fatigue or competition from other films, impacting the series' ability to maintain its initial momentum.

In making this analysis, I followed Rule (A) as two responses consistently highlighted the same financial figures and reasoning, providing a clear and robust overview of the series' performance.
