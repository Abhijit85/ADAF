2. **Cultural Significance**: As a heritage site, the tombs are a testament to the architectural and cultural practices of the Buganda kingdom, serving as a symbol of identity and continuity for the Baganda people.

3. **Impact of Colonialism**: The expansion of the British protectorate and the establishment of institutions like Makerere University in 1922 highlight the colonial influence that reshaped Uganda's socio-political landscape, affecting traditional structures like the Kasubi Tombs.
