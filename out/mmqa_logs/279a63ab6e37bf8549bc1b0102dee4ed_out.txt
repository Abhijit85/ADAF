=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The heliocentric system, a revolutionary model where planets orbit the sun, marked a significant shift in astronomical thought during the 16th and 17th centuries.

1. **Copernican Revolution**: Nicolaus Copernicus is credited with introducing the heliocentric model, challenging the long-standing geocentric view that placed Earth at the center of the universe. His work laid the foundation for modern astronomy.

2. **Kepler's Laws**: Johannes Kepler advanced the heliocentric model by demonstrating that planets move in elliptical orbits rather than perfect circles. This insight was crucial in accurately describing planetary motion and refining the model.

3. **Galileo's Observations**: Galileo Galilei provided empirical support for the heliocentric system through his telescopic observations, such as the phases of Venus and the moons of Jupiter, which were inconsistent with the geocentric model.

4. **Scientific Impact**: The acceptance of the heliocentric model marked a paradigm shift, influencing scientific thought and encouraging a more evidence-based approach to understanding the natural world.

This analysis is based on consistent insights from multiple responses, emphasizing the contributions of Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo in establishing the heliocentric system.
