=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses provided the same answer with clear and robust reasoning, indicating a consensus. This consistency suggests a reliable conclusion, as multiple sources corroborate the information.

2. **Fallback Rule:** In this case, there was no need to apply the fallback rule, as the consistent responses already provided a concrete answer with detailed evidence, making it unnecessary to rely on a single response.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** There was no conflict among the responses that required resolution, as the consistent responses aligned in their conclusions, supported by coherent and well-reasoned explanations.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was selected based on the consistent responses, which demonstrated clarity and depth in their reasoning. This approach ensures that the decision is transparent and logically consistent, directly addressing the original question with a well-supported conclusion.
