=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis focuses on identifying the bird in the image based on its distinct features.

1. **Consistency Check**: Two responses identified the bird as a Song Thrush, citing the brown and white speckled chest and distinct eye stripe as key identifying features. This aligns with common characteristics of the Song Thrush, which is known for these markings.

2. **Fallback Rule**: The third response suggested the bird might be a different species but lacked detailed evidence to support this claim. Given the robust reasoning in the other two responses, the Song Thrush identification is more credible.

3. **Conflict Resolution**: The reasoning in the responses identifying the bird as a Song Thrush was clear and coherent, focusing on specific visual markers that are well-documented in ornithological sources.

4. **Final Synthesis**: The final answer is that the bird is a Song Thrush. This decision is based on the consistent identification by two responses, supported by detailed descriptions of the bird's markings, which are characteristic of the Song Thrush.
