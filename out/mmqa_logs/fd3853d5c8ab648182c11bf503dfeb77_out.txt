=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis focuses on the evolution and influence of the Frankish language, particularly its impact on Old French and the development of certain English terms.

1. **Historical Context**: Frankish was spoken by the Franks from the 4th to the 8th century and is considered "poorly attested," meaning there is limited direct evidence of the language's structure and vocabulary.

2. **Linguistic Influence**: Despite its limited documentation, Frankish significantly influenced Old French through numerous loanwords, indicating a strong cultural and linguistic exchange between the Franks and the regions that spoke Old French.

3. **Language Evolution**: The term "targe," meaning shield in late Old English, evolved into "target" by the 18th century, illustrating how words can shift in meaning over time, possibly influenced by interactions with other languages, including those with Frankish roots.

4. **Regional Variations**: Old Dutch, referring to Old Franconian dialects in the Low Countries, highlights the regional diversity within the Frankish language, which contributed to its influence on neighboring languages and dialects.

The decision to focus on these points is based on the consistent evidence across responses regarding Frankish's influence on Old French and the evolution of specific English terms.
