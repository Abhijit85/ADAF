=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In synthesizing the responses from the cross-modal synthesis agents, the final analysis focuses on the most consistent and well-supported insights.

1. **Consistency Check**: Two responses consistently highlighted a significant increase in market share for Company X over the past year, supported by robust reasoning and data from financial reports and market analysis. This consistency in the data-driven insights makes it the primary focus of the analysis.

2. **Quantitative Insight**: Company X's market share grew by 15% year-over-year, a figure corroborated by both sales data and industry reports, indicating a strong performance relative to competitors.

3. **Contextual Insight**: The growth is attributed to successful product launches and strategic partnerships, which were emphasized in two responses. These factors were supported by evidence from press releases and industry expert commentary.

4. **Conflict Resolution**: The third response suggested a different growth rate but lacked the depth and coherence of the other two. The stronger rationale and detailed evidence in the consistent responses led to the selection of the 15% growth figure as the most accurate.

This synthesis highlights the importance of corroborated data and clear reasoning in determining the most reliable insights.
