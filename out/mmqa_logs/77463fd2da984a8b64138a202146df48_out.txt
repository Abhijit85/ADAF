=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

An isothermal process involves constant temperature, while an adiabatic process involves no heat exchange, highlighting their distinct thermodynamic properties.

1. **Temperature and Heat Exchange**: In an isothermal process, the temperature remains constant (ΔT = 0), requiring interaction with a thermal reservoir to maintain this condition. Conversely, an adiabatic process allows temperature changes (ΔT ≠ 0) but involves no heat exchange with the surroundings (Q = 0).

2. **Internal Energy Changes**: For ideal gases undergoing an isothermal process, the change in internal energy (ΔU) is zero, as the energy added as heat is used to do work. This contrasts with adiabatic processes, where internal energy changes due to work done on or by the system without heat exchange.

3. **Distinct Characteristics**: It is crucial not to confuse these processes, as they have opposite heat exchange properties. Isothermal processes involve heat exchange to maintain constant temperature, while adiabatic processes are insulated from heat exchange, allowing temperature variations.

This analysis is based on fundamental thermodynamic principles, ensuring a clear understanding of these processes' distinct characteristics.
