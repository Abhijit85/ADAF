=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The 1921 Tampa Bay hurricane, also known as the 1921 Tarpon Springs hurricane, was a significant meteorological event in the early 20th century.

1. **Formation and Development**: The hurricane originated from a trough in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on October 20, 1921, marking it as the eleventh tropical cyclone and fifth hurricane of that season.

2. **Intensity**: It reached its peak as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph, showcasing its formidable strength during its lifecycle.

3. **Impact on Tampa Bay**: This storm was notable for being the first major hurricane to strike the Tampa Bay area since 1848, highlighting its historical significance in the region.

4. **Dissipation**: After weakening to a Category 1 while traversing Central Florida, the hurricane was eventually absorbed by a larger extratropical cyclone on October 30, concluding its impact.

This analysis is based on the consistent information provided by multiple sources, emphasizing the hurricane's development, peak intensity, regional impact, and eventual dissipation.
