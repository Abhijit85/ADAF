=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In synthesizing the responses from the cross-modal synthesis agents, the final analysis focuses on the most consistent and well-supported insights.

1. **Consistency Check**: Two responses consistently highlighted a significant increase in market share for Company X over the past year, supported by robust reasoning and quantitative data showing a 15% growth. This consistency in data and reasoning makes it the primary insight.

2. **Fallback Rule**: While one response suggested insufficient information, the other two provided concrete evidence of Company X's strategic acquisitions contributing to its growth. This evidence was detailed, citing specific acquisitions and their impact on market expansion.

3. **Conflict Resolution**: The third response differed slightly, focusing on internal innovation as the growth driver. However, the reasoning was less detailed compared to the acquisition strategy, which was supported by clear examples and data.

4. **Final Synthesis**: The final analysis concludes that Company X's market share growth is primarily driven by strategic acquisitions, as this insight is consistently supported by quantitative data and detailed reasoning across multiple responses.
