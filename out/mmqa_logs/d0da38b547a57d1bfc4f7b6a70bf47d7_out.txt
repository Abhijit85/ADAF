=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The Triple Crown in baseball, a rare achievement, involves leading the league in batting average, home runs, and RBIs, last accomplished by Miguel Cabrera in 2012.

1. **Historical Context**: The Triple Crown has been achieved only 17 times, highlighting its rarity. Before Cabrera, the last player to achieve it was Carl Yastrzemski in 1967, underscoring the difficulty of excelling simultaneously in all three categories over a season.

2. **Skill Indicators**: Achieving the Triple Crown reflects a player's comprehensive batting prowess, including the ability to hit safely, hit for power, and drive in runs, which are critical components of offensive success in baseball.

3. **Visual Evidence**: The image of a player in a Detroit uniform with the number 24, identified as Miguel Cabrera, supports the textual evidence of his achievement, as he is known for his tenure with the Detroit Tigers and wearing that number.

4. **Rarity and Challenge**: The feat is described as "uncommon," emphasizing the challenge of maintaining top performance across diverse batting metrics, which requires consistent excellence and adaptability throughout the season.
