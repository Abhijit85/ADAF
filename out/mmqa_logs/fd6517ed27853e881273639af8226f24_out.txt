=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Hedwig Jagiellon, a Polish and Lithuanian princess, played a significant role in the Jagiellon dynasty's succession dynamics.

1. **Dynastic Context**: Hedwig was initially considered the heiress of the Jagiellon dynasty until her father's sons were born in 1424 and 1427, which shifted the line of succession away from her.

2. **Political Alliances**: Her stepmother, Anna of Cilli, was married to Jogaila in a politically motivated union to strengthen dynastic claims, highlighting the strategic marriages within the dynasty.

3. **Succession Impact**: Hedwig's death in 1431, rumored to be due to poisoning by her stepmother, left her without issue, further complicating the succession and potentially altering the power dynamics within the dynasty.

4. **Historical Implications**: The lack of direct heirs from Hedwig and the political maneuvering surrounding her life and death underscore the fragile nature of dynastic succession during this period.

This analysis is based on consistent insights from multiple responses, emphasizing the political and dynastic implications of Hedwig's life and untimely death.
