=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Based on the synthesis of the three responses, the final analysis is as follows:

The analysis reveals a consensus on the impact of the new policy on local businesses, with two responses providing consistent and robust reasoning.

1. **Increased Revenue**: Two responses agree that the policy has led to a 15% increase in revenue for local businesses, supported by data showing a rise in consumer spending and foot traffic in commercial areas.

2. **Employment Growth**: Both responses highlight a 10% increase in employment rates within the affected sectors, attributed to the expansion of business operations and the opening of new stores.

3. **Community Support**: The policy has garnered strong community support, as evidenced by surveys indicating an 80% approval rate among local residents, who appreciate the economic benefits and improved local services.

4. **Environmental Concerns**: One response notes potential environmental impacts, but the other two responses downplay this, emphasizing the policy's economic advantages and the implementation of mitigation strategies.

The decision to select this analysis is based on the consistency and depth of reasoning provided by the majority of responses, which clearly outline the policy's positive economic effects.
