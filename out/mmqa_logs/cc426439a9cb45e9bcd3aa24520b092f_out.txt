=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses agreed on a specific answer, both providing clear and robust reasoning. This alignment suggests a high level of confidence in the accuracy of the information presented.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response indicated insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. Therefore, it does not outweigh the consistent responses.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Since two responses were consistent and well-reasoned, there was no need for conflict resolution. The agreement between these responses strengthens the reliability of the final answer.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was selected based on the consistency and robustness of reasoning in the two agreeing responses. This decision was influenced by the clarity and coherence of their explanations, ensuring a transparent and logically consistent conclusion.
