=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Which players from the team whose jerseys feature a rooster had a disciplinary record in the 2014-15 Arsenal F.C. season?

**Factual Answer**: The question contains a misunderstanding regarding team symbols. Arsenal F.C. does not have a rooster on their jerseys; this symbol is associated with Tottenham Hotspur F.C. Therefore, there are no Arsenal F.C. players with a rooster symbol on their jerseys to consider for a disciplinary record in the 2014-15 season. If the question intended to refer to Tottenham Hotspur F.C., then specific disciplinary records from the 2014-15 season for that team would be needed.
