Answer Echoes:
- The player who transferred to Persepolis F.C. from Al Shabab in the 2003-04 season is Ali Daei.
- Mehdi Mahdavikia is not mentioned in the provided data, so we need external information for his birth year.
- Ali Daei's age at the time of transfer is listed as 33 years old.
- Since the transfer occurred in the 2003-04 season, we can estimate Ali Daei's birth year by subtracting his age from the year 2003 (the start of the season).
- Birth Year of Ali Daei = 2003 - 33 = 1970.
- Mehdi Mahdavikia was born on July 24, 1977.
- **Ali Daei** was born in 1970.
- **Mehdi Mahdavikia** was born in 1977.
- Ali Daei's age and transfer information from the provided structured data.
- Mehdi Mahdavikia's birth year from external knowledge.
- **Question Type**: Temporal, comparative
- **Information Needs**: Birth years of Mehdi Mahdavikia and the player who transferred to Persepolis F.C. from Al Shabab in the 2003-04 season.
- **Data Sources**: Text context and structured data
- **Reasoning Path**: Determine the birth years of both players and compare them to identify who is older.
- Ali Daei transferred to Persepolis F.C. from Al Shabab in the 2003-04 season.
- Ali Daei's birth year is calculated as 1970 based on structured data analysis, but this contradicts the text context.
- **Text Primary**: Use the text context for Ali Daei's birth year as it provides a specific date.
- **Data Support**: Structured data supports the transfer information but has a discrepancy in birth year calculation.
- **Consistency Check**: Align with the text context for Ali Daei's birth year.
- **Complete Picture**: Ali Daei was born in 1969, and Mehdi Mahdavikia was born in 1977.
