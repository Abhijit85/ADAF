**Factual Answer**: The film "Swarnakamalam" features a variety of backgrounds throughout its scenes, as it is a cinematic work. However, without specific visual data or a detailed scene-by-scene analysis, it is not possible to definitively state the color of the background in any particular scene or the overall film. The film's promotional materials, such as posters, may feature specific colors, but these do not necessarily represent the film's backgrounds.
