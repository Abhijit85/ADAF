=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Does Michele Didoni's shirt have sleeves?

**Factual Answer**: Based on the visual analysis, the image shows athletes wearing athletic gear with the word "CARABINIERI" on their uniforms. This suggests they are part of a sports team associated with the Italian national police force. Typically, athletic shirts worn in such settings have sleeves, although the length can vary (short or long sleeves). However, without a specific image or description of Michele Didoni's shirt, it is not possible to definitively state whether it has sleeves.
