=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Among the airports that are served as destinations by Air Costa, which has a wide arch, topped with blue trim, rising above its main entrance?

**Factual Answer**: The question cannot be answered definitively due to the lack of specific data on the architectural features of airports served by Air Costa. The description of a wide arch with blue trim is a distinctive architectural feature, but without access to detailed information about the design of the main entrances of these airports, it is not possible to identify which airport matches this description.
