=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: How many petals are on the flower in the Brisbane rugby league team logo?

**Factual Answer**: The Brisbane Broncos' logo, which is the primary rugby league team associated with Brisbane, does not feature a flower. Instead, it prominently displays a stylized horse's head. Therefore, there are no petals to count on the logo. If the question refers to a different Brisbane rugby league team or a specific version of the logo that includes a flower, additional details would be needed to provide an accurate answer.

**Source**: Combined analysis from visual and text data.

**Confidence**: High. The information is based on the widely recognized design of the Brisbane Broncos' logo.
