=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Where were the first 4 Interface Message Processors located?

**Factual Answer**: The first four Interface Message Processors (IMPs), which were crucial components of the early ARPANET, were located at:
1. University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)
2. Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in Menlo Park, California
3. University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB)
4. University of Utah in Salt Lake City

**Source**: This answer is based on historical records of ARPANET development and deployment, confirmed by both text context and structured data.

**Confidence**: High

Answer Echoes:
- **Question Type**: Geographic, factual
- **Information Needs**: Specific locations of the first four Interface Message Processors (IMPs)
- **Data Sources**: Text context and structured data
- **Reasoning Path**: Combine historical text information with structured data to identify the locations
- The text mentions that the first IMP was due at UCLA by Labor Day, with subsequent deliveries at one-month intervals.
- Massachusetts-based company Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN) was responsible for building these IMPs.
- The structured data provides the specific locations of the first four IMPs:
- **Text Primary**: The text provides a timeline and the initial location (UCLA).
- **Data Support**: The structured data confirms and supplements the text by listing all four locations.
- **Consistency Check**: Both sources align, confirming the locations and timeline.
