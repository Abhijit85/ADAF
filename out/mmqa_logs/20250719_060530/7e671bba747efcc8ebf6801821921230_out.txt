=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Who came up with the idea of gravity?

**Factual Answer**: The scientific concept of gravity is most famously attributed to Sir Isaac Newton. In the 17th century, he formulated the law of universal gravitation, which describes the gravitational attraction between masses. While earlier thinkers like Aristotle had ideas about motion and heaviness, it was Newton who developed the comprehensive theory of gravity as we understand it today.
