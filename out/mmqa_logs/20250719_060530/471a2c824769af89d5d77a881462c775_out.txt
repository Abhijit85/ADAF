=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What kind of horses race in the A.P. Warrior events with One and One-Quarter Miles?

**Factual Answer**: The structured data provided does not specifically mention the A.P. Warrior events or the type of horses that participate in them. However, races with a distance of one and one-quarter miles, such as the Kentucky Derby, typically feature three-year-old Thoroughbred horses. Without explicit information about the A.P. Warrior events, it is not possible to confirm the type of horses involved in these specific events.

**Source**: Combined analysis from structured data and general knowledge about horse racing.

**Confidence**: Low, due to the lack of specific information about the A.P. Warrior events in the provided data.

Answer Echoes:
- **Question Type**: Factual
- **Information Needs**: Identify the type of horses that participate in the A.P. Warrior events with a specified distance.
- **Data Sources**: Structured data table of horse racing events, general knowledge about horse racing.
- **Reasoning Path**: Determine if the structured data provides information about the A.P. Warrior events and cross-reference with general knowledge about horse racing.
- The text context does not provide specific information about the A.P. Warrior events.
- **Supporting Facts**: The structured data table includes details about various horse racing events, including distances and conditions.
- **Additional Details**: The table specifies the Kentucky Derby as a race for three-year-old Thoroughbreds at a distance of one and a quarter miles, but does not mention A.P. Warrior events specifically.
- **Text Primary**: The text does not mention A.P. Warrior events.
- **Data Support**: The structured data does not explicitly mention A.P. Warrior events or the type of horses involved.
- **Consistency Check**: Ensure any inference aligns with general horse racing knowledge.
- **Complete Picture**: Combine structured data and general knowledge to provide a comprehensive answer.
