=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Which Champion(s), in Yearly results of Catamount Cup, logo has an anchor in it?

**Factual Answer**: The Catamount Cup is a college ice hockey tournament, and the champions are typically college teams. One of the teams that has historically participated in the Catamount Cup is the University of Vermont, whose logo features a catamount, not an anchor. However, the University of Maine, another participant, has a logo that includes an anchor, as it is part of their maritime-themed branding. Therefore, if the University of Maine has won the Catamount Cup in any given year, their logo would be the one with an anchor.
