=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Which teams with a soccer ball on their logo had top goalscorers in the 2019 Belarusian Premier League?

**Factual Answer**: To determine which teams with a soccer ball on their logo had top goalscorers in the 2019 Belarusian Premier League, we need to identify the teams that participated in the league that year, examine their logos for the presence of a soccer ball, and cross-reference this with the list of top goalscorers. One known team with a soccer ball on their logo is FC Gomel, as identified through visual analysis. However, FC Gomel did not participate in the 2019 Belarusian Premier League, as they were in the second tier that year. Therefore, without additional specific data on other teams' logos and top goalscorers, a complete answer cannot be provided.
