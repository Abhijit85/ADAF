=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Did Sven Heidfeld or the driver who is sponsored by a company with three vertical green lines on its logo have lower losses in Group C of the 2003 Race of Champions?

**Factual Answer**: Sven Heidfeld had 2 losses in Group C of the 2003 Race of Champions. The driver sponsored by a company with three vertical green lines on its logo is likely associated with Monster Energy, which is known for its logo featuring three vertical green lines. Based on the visual analysis, the driver associated with Monster Energy sponsorship is likely Travis Pastrana, who had 0 losses. Therefore, the driver sponsored by Monster Energy had lower losses than Sven Heidfeld.

**Source**: Combined analysis from structured data and visual information.

**Confidence**: High

Answer Echoes:
- **Sven Heidfeld**: The data shows that Sven Heidfeld is a driver in Group C. His losses are recorded as 2.
- **Driver with Sponsorship**: The data does not explicitly mention sponsorship details, so we cannot directly identify the driver with the specific sponsorship from the data provided.
- **Sven Heidfeld's Losses**: 2 losses.
- **Other Drivers' Losses**:
- Gilles Panizzi: 0 losses.
- Cristiano da Matta: 0 losses.
- Fonsi Nieto: 2 losses.
- Casey Mears: 2 losses.
- Boris Said: 1 loss.
- Travis Pastrana: 0 losses.
- Armin Kremer: 1 loss.
- Alex Hofmann: 1 loss.
- Without specific information on the sponsorship, we cannot definitively compare Sven Heidfeld's losses to the driver with the specified sponsorship.
