=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Among the top goal-scoring players on the Serbian national football team, who has lower Caps: the white-haired athlete, or the man who lived longer out of the pair of Stjepan Bobek and Ferenc Puskas?

**Factual Answer**: To determine who has fewer Caps, we need to compare the number of Caps for the white-haired athlete among the top goal-scoring players on the Serbian national football team and Stjepan Bobek, who lived longer than Ferenc Puskas. Stjepan Bobek, a prominent figure in Yugoslav football history, lived for 86 years, while Ferenc Puskas lived for 79 years. However, the specific number of Caps for both the white-haired athlete and Stjepan Bobek is not provided in the available data. Therefore, without this specific information, we cannot conclusively determine who has fewer Caps.

**Source**: Combined (text and data analysis)

**Confidence**: Low, due to missing specific Caps information for both individuals.

Answer Echoes:
- The specific number of Caps for the white-haired athlete among the top goal-scoring players on the Serbian national football team.
- The specific number of Caps for Stjepan Bobek.
- **Question Type**: Comparative
- **Information Needs**: Number of Caps for the white-haired athlete and Stjepan Bobek
- **Data Sources**: Text context and structured data
- **Reasoning Path**: Compare the number of Caps for both individuals
- **Stjepan Bobek**: Known as one of Yugoslavia's greatest players, but the text does not provide the number of Caps.
- **Ferenc Puskas**: The text provides his goal-scoring record but not the number of Caps for Bobek.
- **Lifespan**: Stjepan Bobek lived for 86 years, and Ferenc Puskas lived for 79 years. Bobek lived longer.
- **Missing Information**: The number of Caps for the white-haired athlete and Stjepan Bobek.
- **Text Primary**: Use text context to identify Stjepan Bobek's significance.
- **Data Support**: Use structured data to confirm Bobek's lifespan and Caps.
- **Consistency Check**: Ensure information aligns across sources.
