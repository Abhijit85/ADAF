=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What common item can be seen in the hands of members of the team that took part in the production in which Michael Potts acted at Broadhurst Theatre?

**Factual Answer**: In the production "Lennon" at the Broadhurst Theatre, where Michael Potts acted, a common item likely seen in the hands of the team would be musical instruments, particularly guitars. This is because the musical is based on the life of John Lennon, who was famously known for playing the guitar. Additionally, the visual analysis suggests that participants in related events or performances might have worn themed attire, such as t-shirts with "NEW YORK CITY" printed on them, which aligns with the urban and musical theme of the production.
