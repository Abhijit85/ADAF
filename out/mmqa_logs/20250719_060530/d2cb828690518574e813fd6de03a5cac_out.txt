- The structured data provides information on the first settlers of Canada, identifying them as Indigenous peoples who migrated from Asia to North America via the Beringia land bridge during the last Ice Age.
- **Text Primary**: The text provides context on later European settlements but not the earliest settlers.
- **Data Support**: Structured data confirms the origin of the first settlers as Indigenous peoples from Asia.
- **Consistency Check**: The information aligns with known historical and anthropological studies.
- **Complete Picture**: Combine structured data insights with historical context.
