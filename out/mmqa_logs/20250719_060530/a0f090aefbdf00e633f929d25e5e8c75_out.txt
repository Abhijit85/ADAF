=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: The football team that was coached in 2001 by the person who also coached the Scottish Claymores plays its home games in a certain stadium. During the 2010 Florida Tuskers season schedule, on what date did they play at this same stadium?

**Factual Answer**: The football team coached in 2001 by Jim Criner, who also coached the Scottish Claymores, was the Las Vegas Outlaws. The Las Vegas Outlaws played their home games at Sam Boyd Stadium. During the 2010 Florida Tuskers season, they did not play at Sam Boyd Stadium; instead, they played their home games at the Citrus Bowl. Therefore, there is no date during the 2010 Florida Tuskers season when they played at Sam Boyd Stadium.
