=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Was Battlefield Earth or title that shows two guys riding surfboards on cover earlier Marques Houston film?

**Factual Answer**: Marques Houston did not appear in "Battlefield Earth." The film "Battlefield America," which might be confused with "Battlefield Earth," was released in 2012 and features Marques Houston. Regarding a film with a cover showing two guys riding surfboards, there is no such film listed in the data provided that features Marques Houston. However, Marques Houston appeared in "Good Burger" (1997), which is a comedy film featuring Kenan and Kel, but it does not have a cover with two guys riding surfboards. Therefore, "Good Burger" is an earlier film than "Battlefield America."
