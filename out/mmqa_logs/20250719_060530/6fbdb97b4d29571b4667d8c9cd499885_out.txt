**Factual Answer**: The structured data indicates that Matthew Rhys played the role of Macduff in "Macbeth" at The Young Vic in 2004. However, the data does not specify which hand of the character is visible. The visual analysis of the image suggests it is an artistic representation of Macduff, but it does not provide information about which hand is visible. Therefore, without specific visual or descriptive information from production photos or detailed reviews, it is not possible to determine which hand of the character Macduff, played by Matthew Rhys, is visible.
