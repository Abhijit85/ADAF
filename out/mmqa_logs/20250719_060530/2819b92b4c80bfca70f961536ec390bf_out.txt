=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In what films with exactly one person on their poster did Lou Reed play himself?

**Factual Answer**: Lou Reed played himself in several films, but to determine which of these films have posters featuring exactly one person, we need to examine the posters for each film. Based on available information, "Faraway, So Close!" (1993) is known to have a poster featuring a single person, which is an angel character central to the film's theme. Therefore, "Faraway, So Close!" is a film where Lou Reed played himself and the poster features exactly one person.
