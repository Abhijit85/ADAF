=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: How many fans attended the college football game at Gillette Stadium when the visiting team had a star on their logo?

**Factual Answer**: Based on the available information, there is no record of a college football game at Gillette Stadium where the visiting team is known for having a star on their logo. The structured data provided does not include any college teams with a star on their logo that played at Gillette Stadium. Additionally, the visual analysis suggests an association with Vanderbilt University, which uses a star in its logo, but there is no specific data indicating that Vanderbilt played at Gillette Stadium. Therefore, the attendance figure for such a game cannot be determined from the provided information.
