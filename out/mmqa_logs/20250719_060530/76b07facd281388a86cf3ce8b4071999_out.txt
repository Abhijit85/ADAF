=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: The French Air Force aircraft engine series Hispano-Suiza V-12's last two models were used mainly around what war(s)?

**Factual Answer**: The last two models of the Hispano-Suiza V-12 aircraft engine series, specifically the 12Y and 12Z, were primarily used around World War II. The 12Y was actively used by the French Air Force before and during the war, powering aircraft such as the Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 and Dewoitine D.520. The 12Z was developed during the war but saw limited production due to the German occupation of France.

**Source**: Combined analysis from historical records and structured data on aircraft engines used during World War II.

**Confidence**: High

Answer Echoes:
- **Question Type**: Temporal, factual
- **Information Needs**: Identify the wars during which the last two models of the Hispano-Suiza V-12 engine series were primarily used.
- **Data Sources**: Text context and structured data
- **Reasoning Path**: Combine historical context from the text with structured data to determine the relevant wars.
- **Temporal Information**: The Hispano-Suiza 12Z entered production around the time of World War II, but full-scale production was halted due to the German occupation. The 12Y was used pre-WWII and during WWII.
- **Factual Definitions**: The 12Z was the final evolution of the Hispano-Suiza V-12 series, and the 12Y was a primary engine for the French Air Force before and during WWII.
- **Supporting Facts**: The engines were used in aircraft that served during World War II.
- **Additional Details**: The 12Y was used in famous aircraft like the Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 and Dewoitine D.520, which were active during WWII.
- **Text Primary**: The text provides the historical context of the engine's development and usage.
- **Data Support**: Structured data confirms the use of these engines in WWII aircraft.
- **Consistency Check**: Information aligns across sources, confirming the engines' association with WWII.
- **Complete Picture**: The engines were primarily used during World War II.
