=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Is a woolly mammoth the same as a mastodon?

**Factual Answer**: No, a woolly mammoth is not the same as a mastodon. They were different species with distinct physical and ecological characteristics. Woolly mammoths belonged to the genus *Mammuthus* and were adapted to cold environments, featuring long, shaggy hair, high domed skulls, and long, curved tusks. They lived during the Pleistocene epoch. In contrast, mastodons belonged to the genus *Mammut* and lived in forested regions. They had shorter, straighter tusks and teeth adapted for browsing on leaves and branches. Both species were part of the order Proboscidea, which includes elephants, but they were not closely related to each other.

**Source**: Text context and general paleontological knowledge.

**Confidence**: High

Answer Echoes:
- **Woolly Mammoth**: Belonged to the genus *Mammuthus*. They were adapted to cold environments, with long, shaggy hair, and lived during the Pleistocene epoch. They had high, domed skulls and long, curved tusks.
- **Mastodon**: Belonged to the genus *Mammut*. They lived in forested regions and had shorter, straighter tusks. Their teeth were different, adapted for browsing on leaves and branches, unlike the woolly mammoth's teeth, which were suited for grazing.
- **Question Type**: Comparative, factual
- **Information Needs**: Determine if a woolly mammoth and a mastodon are the same species.
- **Data Sources**: Text context provided
- **Reasoning Path**: Compare characteristics and classifications of woolly mammoths and mastodons.
- **Comparative Information**: The text provides a comparison between mastodons and mammoths, noting differences in physical characteristics and ecological adaptations.
- **Factual Definitions**: Mastodons are described as being similar in appearance to elephants and mammoths but not closely related to either.
- **Text Primary**: The text clearly distinguishes between mastodons and woolly mammoths based on physical and ecological differences.
- **Data Support**: No structured data provided, but the text context is sufficient for the analysis.
- **Consistency Check**: Information aligns with general paleontological knowledge.
