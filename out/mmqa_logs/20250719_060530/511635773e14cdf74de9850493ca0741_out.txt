=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: The +1 lap 1971 Race of Champions Driver does what with right hand?

**Factual Answer**: The question seems to imply a specific action or gesture by the driver with his right hand, which is not covered in the race result data or any textual context provided. The structured data from the 1971 Race of Champions indicates that John Surtees was the driver who finished with "+1 lap," but it does not include any information about his actions during the race. Additionally, the visual analysis describes an image of a person in a vintage racing car holding a pen and writing on a notepad, but it does not confirm if this is John Surtees or if it is related to the race in question. Therefore, without additional context or sources, it is not possible to accurately answer what the driver does with his right hand.

**Source**: Combined analysis of structured race data and visual information.

**Confidence**: Medium, due to the lack of specific information about the driver's actions with his right hand in the available data and visual context.
