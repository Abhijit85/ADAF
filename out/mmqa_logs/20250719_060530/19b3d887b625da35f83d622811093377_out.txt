=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: When did the metric system start in Canada?

**Factual Answer**: The metric system was officially adopted in Canada in 1970. This transition was part of a broader effort to standardize measurements and align with international practices. The move was influenced by Canada's historical ties with the UK, its proximity to the US, and some public opposition.

**Source**: Combined analysis from historical records, government documentation, and structured data.

**Confidence**: High

Answer Echoes:
- **Question Type**: Temporal, factual
- **Information Needs**: The specific date or year when the metric system started in Canada
- **Data Sources**: Text context and structured data
- **Reasoning Path**: Combine text context with structured data to confirm the date of metrication in Canada
- **Temporal Information**: The text context states that metrication in Canada began in 1970.
- **Cultural Context**: The transition was influenced by historical ties with the UK, proximity to the US, and public opposition.
- **Supporting Facts**: The structured data confirms that the metric system was officially adopted in Canada in 1970.
- **Additional Details**: No additional details are provided in the structured data.
- **Text Primary**: The text context provides the primary information that metrication began in 1970.
- **Data Support**: Structured data supports the text by confirming the adoption year.
- **Consistency Check**: Both sources align on the year 1970.
- **Complete Picture**: The metric system started in Canada in 1970, with influences from international practices and historical ties.
