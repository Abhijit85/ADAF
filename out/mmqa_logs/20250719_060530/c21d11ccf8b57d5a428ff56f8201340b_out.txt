=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Who owns the means of production in capitalism?

**Factual Answer**: In capitalism, the means of production are owned by private individuals or corporations. This ownership structure is characterized by private property rights, where individuals or businesses have the legal right to own, use, and transfer property, including factories, machinery, and other resources used to produce goods and services. The surplus product generated from these means of production typically becomes a source of income for the owners, distinguishing capitalism from other economic systems where ownership might be collective or state-controlled.
