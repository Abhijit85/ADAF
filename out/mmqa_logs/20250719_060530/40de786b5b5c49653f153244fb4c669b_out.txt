=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Is Puerto Rico the 51st state of the United States?

**Factual Answer**: Puerto Rico is not the 51st state of the United States. It is an unincorporated territory of the United States. Although there have been referendums in which Puerto Ricans have voted in favor of statehood, Congress has not granted statehood to Puerto Rico. Therefore, it remains a territory rather than a state.
