=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the method of execution in China?

**Factual Answer**: In China, the primary methods of execution are lethal injection and shooting. Lethal injection has become more prevalent in recent years due to its perceived humaneness and efficiency. Historically, shooting, typically by a single gunshot to the back of the head, was the most common method, but it has largely been replaced by lethal injection.

**Source**: Text analysis and general knowledge.

**Confidence**: High

Answer Echoes:
- **Question Type**: Factual
