=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What milestone did the player wearing a blue helmet achieve in the Calgary Flames season of 2017-18?

**Factual Answer**: Based on the available analyses, there is no direct information linking a player wearing a blue helmet to a specific milestone achieved during the Calgary Flames' 2017-18 NHL season. The structured data does not include details about helmet colors, and the visual analysis indicates that the player wearing a blue helmet is associated with the Regina Pats of the Western Hockey League, not the Calgary Flames. Therefore, it is not possible to determine a milestone for a Calgary Flames player wearing a blue helmet without additional context or information.

**Source**: Combined analysis from structured data and visual information.

**Confidence**: Medium (due to lack of specific information about helmet colors in the context of the Calgary Flames).
