=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Can a commercial jet break the sound barrier?

**Factual Answer**: Yes, a commercial jet can break the sound barrier, but it is not common. The Concorde was a notable example of a commercial jet specifically designed to fly faster than the speed of sound (Mach 1) and regularly did so during its operational years. Another example includes the Soviet Tu-144, which was also designed for supersonic passenger travel. Additionally, there have been instances where commercial jets, such as a Douglas DC-8 in 1961 and possibly a China Airlines 747 in 1985, have broken the sound barrier under specific circumstances, such as controlled dives or in-flight upsets. However, most commercial jets are not designed to exceed the speed of sound due to considerations like fuel efficiency, noise regulations, and structural integrity.
