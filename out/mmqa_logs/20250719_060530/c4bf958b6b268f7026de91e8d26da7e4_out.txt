=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: A trident symbol represents which of the planets in the planets of Doppler spectroscopy?

**Factual Answer**: The trident symbol is traditionally associated with the planet Neptune. In both astrology and astronomy, Neptune is represented by a trident, which symbolizes the trident of Neptune, the Roman god of the sea. However, the context of "planets of Doppler spectroscopy" typically refers to exoplanets discovered using this method. The trident symbol is not specifically used to represent any exoplanet discovered through Doppler spectroscopy, as it is a symbol associated with Neptune, a planet in our solar system.
