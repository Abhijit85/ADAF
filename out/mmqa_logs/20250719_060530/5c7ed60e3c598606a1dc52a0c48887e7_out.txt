=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Is there an 8th season of the P. Feig TV title with a poster with green color?

**Factual Answer**: Based on the available information, it is not possible to confirm the existence of an 8th season of a TV show directed or produced by P. Feig with a green-colored poster. The analysis did not provide any relevant data or text context related to such a TV show. Additionally, the visual analysis focused on "Parks and Recreation," which is unrelated to P. Feig and only ran for seven seasons.

**Source**: Combined analysis of text, data, and visual information.

**Confidence**: Low, due to the lack of specific information regarding P. Feig's TV shows and their promotional materials.
