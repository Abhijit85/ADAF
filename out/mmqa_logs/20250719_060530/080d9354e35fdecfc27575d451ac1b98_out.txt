=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In Planets of Doppler spectroscopy, what happened to the great dark spot on the planet represented by a trident symbol?

**Factual Answer**: The Great Dark Spot on Neptune, which is represented by a trident symbol, was a storm feature similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot. It was discovered by the Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1989. However, by 1994, when the Hubble Space Telescope observed Neptune, the Great Dark Spot had disappeared. This disappearance could be due to atmospheric changes or other unknown mechanisms.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text and structured data, including observations from the Voyager 2 spacecraft and the Hubble Space Telescope.

**Confidence**: High
