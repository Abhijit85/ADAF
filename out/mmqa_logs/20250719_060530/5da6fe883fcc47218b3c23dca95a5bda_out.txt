=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Between Gwladys Nocera and the player that has very short blond hair, which player is ranked higher in the 2009 Ladies European Tour?

**Factual Answer**: Based on the available data, Gwladys Nocera is ranked 9th in the 2009 Ladies European Tour Order of Merit. However, without additional context or visual data to identify the player with very short blond hair, it is not possible to determine their rank or compare it to Gwladys Nocera's rank. Additional information, such as visual identification or external sources describing the players' appearances, would be necessary to provide a complete answer.

**Source**: Structured data from the "Order of Merit rankings" for the 2009 Ladies European Tour.

**Confidence**: Medium (due to the lack of visual or descriptive context to identify the second player).

Answer Echoes:
- **Gwladys Nocera**: Ranked 9th with earnings of €137,730.27.
- **Player with very short blond hair**: The question implies a need for additional context to identify this player, as hair color is not a data point in the table.
