=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Which video game title was Wes Johnson a voice actor for first: The upcoming expansion of World of Warcraft or The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim?

**Factual Answer**: Wes Johnson was a voice actor for "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim" first. "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim" was released in 2011, and Wes Johnson voiced characters such as Hermaeus Mora, Emperor Titus Mede II, and Sheogorath. The "World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth," which is the latest known expansion featuring Wes Johnson, was released in 2018. Since the question refers to an "upcoming expansion" of "World of Warcraft," it implies a future release beyond the data provided, which ends in 2018. Therefore, Wes Johnson's involvement in "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim" predates his involvement in any known "World of Warcraft" expansion.

**Source**: Combined analysis from structured data and text context.
