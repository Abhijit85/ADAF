=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Is point guard and shooting guard the same thing?

**Factual Answer**: No, a point guard and a shooting guard are not the same thing. In basketball, the point guard is responsible for directing the team's offense, handling the ball, and making strategic plays. They are often seen as the "floor general" and are skilled in passing and dribbling. The shooting guard, on the other hand, is generally focused on scoring points and is often one of the team's primary shooters, skilled in shooting from long distances and assisting in ball handling.
