=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Shield volcanoes tend to erupt what type of lava?

**Factual Answer**: Shield volcanoes tend to erupt basaltic lava. This type of lava is characterized by its low viscosity, which allows it to flow easily and spread over large areas, contributing to the broad, gently sloping profiles typical of shield volcanoes.

**Source**: Combined analysis from geological and volcanological studies, supported by text context and structured data.

**Confidence**: High

Answer Echoes:
- **Question Type**: Factual
- **Information Needs**: Type of lava typically erupted by shield volcanoes
- **Data Sources**: Text context and structured data
- **Reasoning Path**: Combine text context with structured data to confirm the type of lava
- **Factual Definitions**: Shield volcanoes are characterized by their low profile due to the highly fluid (low viscosity) lava they erupt.
- **Key Characteristics**: The lava is described as having low viscosity, which allows it to travel farther and form broad sheets.
- **Supporting Facts**: Shield volcanoes tend to erupt basaltic lava, which is characterized by its low viscosity.
- **Text Primary**: The text context describes the lava as highly fluid and low in viscosity.
- **Data Support**: Structured data confirms that shield volcanoes erupt basaltic lava, which is low in viscosity.
- **Consistency Check**: Both sources agree on the low viscosity characteristic.
- **Complete Picture**: The combined information provides a comprehensive answer.
