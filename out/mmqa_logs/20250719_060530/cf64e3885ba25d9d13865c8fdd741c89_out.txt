=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What are the two types of circular motion?

**Factual Answer**: The two types of circular motion are:
1. **Uniform Circular Motion**: This is when an object moves in a circle at a constant speed. Although the speed remains constant, the direction of the velocity changes continuously as the object moves along the circular path.
2. **Non-uniform Circular Motion**: This occurs when an object moves in a circle with a varying speed. In this type of motion, both the speed and the direction of the velocity can change as the object travels along the circular path.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context and structured data on basic physics principles related to motion.

**Confidence**: High

Answer Echoes:
- **Question Type**: Factual
- **Information Needs**: Identification and classification of types of circular motion
- **Data Sources**: Text context and structured data analysis
- **Reasoning Path**: Combine definitions and classifications from text with structured data support
- **Factual Definitions**: Circular motion is described as movement along a circle's circumference, which can be uniform or non-uniform.
- **Classifications**: Two types are identified—uniform circular motion and non-uniform circular motion.
- **Supporting Facts**: The structured data confirms the classification of circular motion into two types: uniform and non-uniform.
- **Additional Details**: Provides definitions and characteristics of each type.
- Uniform Circular Motion: Constant speed, continuous change in velocity direction.
- Non-uniform Circular Motion: Varying speed along the circular path.
- **Text Primary**: The text provides the primary explanation of circular motion types.
- **Data Support**: Structured data confirms and supplements the text explanation.
- **Consistency Check**: Information aligns across text and structured data.
- **Complete Picture**: Both sources together provide a full understanding of the types of circular motion.

                       'moves in a circle at a constant speed. Although the '
                       'speed remains constant, the direction of the velocity '

                       'this type of motion, both the speed and the direction '
