=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the name of the castle in Edinburgh which has a narrow set of stairs leading up to its entryway, and was built in the seventeenth century?

**Factual Answer**: Based on the available data and analysis, there is no specific mention of a castle in Edinburgh built in the seventeenth century that features a narrow set of stairs leading up to its entryway. The castles identified from the data as being built in the seventeenth century are Craigcrook Castle and Liberton Tower. However, neither of these is described with the specific architectural feature of narrow stairs. Additional architectural details or historical descriptions would be needed to conclusively identify a castle with this feature.

**Source**: Structured data provided in the analysis.

**Confidence**: Medium (due to the lack of specific information about the narrow stairs in the available data).

Answer Echoes:
- Craigcrook Castle: Built by the Adamson family in the 17th century.
- Liberton Tower: Built in the 17th century.
