=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: When does the action start in Hitman Reborn?

**Factual Answer**: In the anime "Hitman Reborn," the action significantly picks up during the "Kokuyo Arc," which begins around episode 20. This marks the transition from the initial comedic and character-introduction phase to more action-oriented and plot-driven episodes. In the manga, a similar shift to more action-oriented and typical shōnen content occurs after volume eight.
