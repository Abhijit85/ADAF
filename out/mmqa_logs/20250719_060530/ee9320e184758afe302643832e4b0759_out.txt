=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Does Alan Alda's 1980 Golden Globe nominated work have signs pointing in multiple directions?

**Factual Answer**: Alan Alda's 1980 Golden Globe nominated work was for his role in "M*A*S*H." While the title "M*A*S*H" itself does not suggest signs pointing in multiple directions, the show is famously associated with a visual element that does: the iconic signpost at the fictional 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital. This signpost featured in the show points in multiple directions, indicating distances to various cities around the world, symbolizing the diverse origins of the personnel stationed there and their connections to places far from the Korean War setting.

**Source**: Combined analysis from structured data and visual context.

**Confidence**: High, as the information is corroborated by both the structured data on Alan Alda's nomination and the well-known visual element from the "M*A*S*H" series.
