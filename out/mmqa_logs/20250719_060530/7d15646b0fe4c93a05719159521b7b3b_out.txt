=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Which single from Portishead's second studio album was #25 in the UK charts at the time of its release?

**Factual Answer**: The single "Over" from Portishead's second studio album "Portishead" was #25 in the UK charts at the time of its release.

**Source**: Text context analysis

**Confidence**: Medium, due to the discrepancy between the text context and the structured data analysis. The text context directly states that "Over" was #25, while the structured data analysis claims "All Mine" was #25 based on external sources. Verification from an authoritative music chart source would increase confidence.
