=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Iain Canning acted in the film Widows directed by this person holding what in his left hand?

**Factual Answer**: The film "Widows" was directed by Steve McQueen. There is no evidence or information available that suggests Iain Canning acted in the film "Widows" or what he might be holding in his left hand. However, a visual analysis shows a person in formal attire holding an Oscar statuette, which is a symbol of achievement in the film industry, but this does not directly relate to Iain Canning's involvement in "Widows."

**Source**: Combined analysis from structured data and visual information.

**Confidence**: Medium, due to the lack of specific information about Iain Canning's role or actions in the film "Widows."
