=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What length of hair does My Church have, short or long?

**Factual Answer**: The question seems to be a misunderstanding, as "My Church" is not a person or character with hair, but rather a song by Maren Morris. The cover art for the song features Maren Morris, who is known for having long hair. Therefore, if the question is indirectly referring to Maren Morris in the context of "My Church," the answer would be that she has long hair.
