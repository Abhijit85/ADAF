=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Which opera with a poster featuring only a single man was composed by Giacomo Puccini and performed by Sharon Azrieli?

**Factual Answer**: The opera "Turandot," composed by Giacomo Puccini and performed in 2008, is a potential match based on the available data. However, the specific detail about the poster featuring only a single man is not confirmed in the provided data. Additional context or external verification is needed to conclusively determine if "Turandot" or another opera fits the poster description.

**Source**: Combined analysis of structured data and text context.

**Confidence**: Medium, due to the lack of explicit information about the poster design in the provided data.

Answer Echoes:
- "La bohème" (1992, 2014)
- "Manon Lescaut" (1993)
- "Turandot" (2008)
- "Il Trittico" (2018)
- The data does not explicitly mention Sharon Azrieli, but it lists performances and roles that could potentially be associated with her.
- The data does not provide explicit information about the posters for these operas.
