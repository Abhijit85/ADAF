=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Does Lex Luthor know who Superman is in "Smallville"?

**Factual Answer**: In the TV show "Smallville," Lex Luthor does discover Clark Kent's secret identity as "The Traveler" during season seven, which is a significant step towards knowing Clark is Superman. However, due to narrative devices such as memory loss, Lex does not retain this knowledge throughout the series. Therefore, while he temporarily knows Clark's secret, he does not have a lasting confirmation of Clark Kent as Superman during the show's original run.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text and data.

**Confidence**: Medium - The text context provides a specific instance where Lex discovers Clark's secret, but the structured data indicates that this knowledge is not retained throughout the series due to plot developments like memory loss.
