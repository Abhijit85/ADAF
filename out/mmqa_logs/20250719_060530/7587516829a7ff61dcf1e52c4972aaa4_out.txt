=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In the music of Sudesh Bhosale, when the movie name has an umbrella on its poster, what was the title?

**Factual Answer**: Based on the available analyses, there is no direct information linking Sudesh Bhosale's music to a specific movie with an umbrella on its poster. The structured data does not mention Sudesh Bhosale or provide visual details about movie posters. The visual analysis describes an image with a red umbrella, but it is likely promotional for a television show or event, not a movie associated with Sudesh Bhosale. Therefore, without additional context or specific data, the question cannot be answered accurately.
