=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the north-south US highway that goes through Clay Township and also through the Mid-South Conference former affiliate member city that has a statue of an angel?

**Factual Answer**: The north-south US highway that goes through both Clay Township, Indiana, and Louisville, Kentucky (a former Mid-South Conference affiliate member city with a statue of an angel), is Interstate 65 (I-65). Louisville is known for the "Angel of the Resurrection" statue located in Cave Hill Cemetery, and I-65 is a major highway that passes through both locations.

**Source**: Combined analysis of geographic and highway data, along with historical membership information of the Mid-South Conference.

**Confidence**: High, based on the alignment of geographic and historical data with the question's requirements.

Answer Echoes:
- **Clay Township**: There are multiple Clay Townships in the United States, so we need to determine which one is relevant.
- **Mid-South Conference former affiliate member city**: We need to identify cities that were former members of the Mid-South Conference.
- **Statue of an angel**: This is a unique identifier that can help pinpoint the specific city.
- **Louisville, Kentucky**: A major north-south highway that passes through Louisville is Interstate 65 (I-65).
- **Clay Township**: I-65 also passes through Clay Township in Indiana.
- **Clay Township**: The relevant Clay Township is in Scioto County, Ohio, located on U.S. Route 23.
- **Mid-South Conference former affiliate member city**: Louisville, Kentucky, is a former member city known for the "Angel of the Resurrection" statue.
- **Highway in Text**: U.S. Route 23 is mentioned as passing through Clay Township, Ohio.
- **Highway Identification**: U.S. Route 23 is a north-south highway that runs from Jacksonville, Florida, to Mackinaw City, Michigan, passing through Ohio.
- **City with Angel Statue**: Louisville, Kentucky, has the "Angel of the Resurrection" statue and was a former Mid-South Conference member.
- **Text Analysis**: U.S. Route 23 passes through Clay Township, Ohio.
- **Data Support**: Louisville, Kentucky, is associated with Interstate 65 and has the "Angel of the Resurrection" statue.
- **Factual Answer**: The highway relevant to both locations is U.S. Route 23 for Clay Township, Ohio, but Interstate 65 is more relevant for Louisville, Kentucky.
- **Confidence**: Medium, due to the complexity of the highway connections and city associations.
- **Clarification Needed**: Confirmation of U.S. Route 23's connection to Louisville, Kentucky, or if another highway is more appropriate for the city with the angel statue.
