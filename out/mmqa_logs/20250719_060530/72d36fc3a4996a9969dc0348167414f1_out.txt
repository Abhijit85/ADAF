=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Which Team(s), in Results by opponent of 2016–17 HNK Rijeka season, has a weasel on its logo?

**Factual Answer**: Based on general knowledge, the football club Dinamo Zagreb features a marten, which is a weasel-like animal, on its logo. This symbol is commonly associated with the club. However, without a specific list of teams that HNK Rijeka played against in the 2016–17 season, I cannot definitively confirm if Dinamo Zagreb was one of the opponents during that season.
