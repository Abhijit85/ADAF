=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Are the North and South Islands of New Zealand connected?

**Factual Answer**: The North and South Islands of New Zealand are not physically connected by land. They are separated by the Cook Strait, a body of water that is approximately 22 kilometers wide at its narrowest point. Despite this separation, the islands are connected through transportation services, including ferries and flights, which facilitate travel between them.
