=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Who was the player during the 2005 Rule 5 draft from whom the Cubs defeated to get to the World Series?

**Factual Answer**: The question appears to be based on a misunderstanding. The 2005 Rule 5 draft does not have a direct connection to the Chicago Cubs' journey to the World Series in 2016. The Cubs defeated the San Francisco Giants and the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 2016 postseason to reach the World Series. However, the 2005 Rule 5 draft data does not provide information about players from those teams or any connection to the Cubs' 2016 postseason opponents.

**Source**: Combined analysis of text and structured data.

**Confidence**: High, due to the lack of relevant data linking the 2005 Rule 5 draft to the Cubs' 2016 World Series journey.

Answer Echoes:
- The Chicago Cubs won the National League Central and had the best record in the major leagues in 2016.
- They defeated the San Francisco Giants in the NL Division Series and the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL Championship Series to reach the World Series.
- The structured data from the 2005 Rule 5 draft does not provide information about the Cubs' opponents in the 2016 postseason or any players from those teams.
- The question seems to be based on a misunderstanding or misalignment of data. The 2005 Rule 5 draft does not relate to the Cubs' 2016 postseason opponents. Therefore, no player from the 2005 Rule 5 draft can be directly linked to the Cubs' journey to the World Series in 2016 based on the provided data.
- Specific details about the 2016 postseason opponents' rosters or any connections to the 2005 Rule 5 draft would be needed to establish a link, which is not present in the current data.
