=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Why did European explorers seek a Northwest Passage?

**Factual Answer**: European explorers sought a Northwest Passage primarily to find a shorter and more efficient maritime route to Asia. During the Age of Exploration, European nations were eager to establish direct trade routes to Asia to access valuable commodities such as spices, silk, and other goods. The existing routes around the southern tip of Africa (Cape of Good Hope) and South America (Cape Horn) were long and perilous. A Northwest Passage through the Arctic, connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, promised a potentially quicker and safer route, which would enhance trade opportunities and economic benefits for the explorers' home countries.
