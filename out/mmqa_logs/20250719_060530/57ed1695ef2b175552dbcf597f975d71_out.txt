=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Which player shown in this photo with a ball was drafted in round two of the NFL Draft in 1949 when the position was Back?

**Factual Answer**: Based on the structured data analysis, the players drafted in the second round of the 1949 NFL Draft with the position "Back" include John Panelli, Bob DeMoss, Harper Davis, George Sims, Frank Burns, Billy Grimes, and Dick McKissack. The visual analysis suggests the image depicts a player from the early to mid-20th century, consistent with the 1949 time frame. Without specific visual identification of the player in the photo, it is not possible to definitively match the image to one of these players. However, these are the players who fit the criteria from the draft data.

**Source**: Combined analysis from structured data and visual context.

**Confidence**: Medium, due to the inability to visually identify the specific player in the photo.
