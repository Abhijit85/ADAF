=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Which drink is considered a highball, a Rickey or a Greyhound?

**Factual Answer**: A Rickey is considered a highball because it includes a spirit (gin or bourbon), citrus juice (lime), and carbonated water, which are typical components of a highball cocktail. The Greyhound, while often served in a highball glass, does not typically include carbonated water, which is a defining characteristic of a highball.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text definitions and structured data on cocktail ingredients.

**Confidence**: High

Answer Echoes:
- **Rickey**: A Rickey is a cocktail made with gin or bourbon, lime juice, and carbonated water. It is served in a highball glass over ice.
- **Greyhound**: A Greyhound is a cocktail made with vodka or gin and grapefruit juice. It is typically served in a highball glass but does not always include carbonated water.
- **Question Type**: Categorical
- **Information Needs**: Determine which drink is classified as a highball
- **Data Sources**: Text context and structured data
- **Reasoning Path**: Combine text definitions and structured data analysis to determine classification
- **Factual Definitions**: A Rickey is defined as a highball drink made with gin or bourbon, lime, and carbonated water. The Greyhound is a cocktail made with grapefruit juice and gin or vodka, with no mention of carbonated water.
- **Supporting Facts**: The Rickey includes carbonated water, a key component of highball cocktails. The Greyhound does not typically include carbonated water, which is a defining feature of highballs.
- **Text Primary**: The text clearly defines the Rickey as a highball.
- **Data Support**: Structured data confirms the presence of carbonated water in the Rickey, a key highball component.
- **Consistency Check**: Both sources consistently classify the Rickey as a highball.
- **Complete Picture**: The Rickey is a highball due to its ingredients and preparation method.
