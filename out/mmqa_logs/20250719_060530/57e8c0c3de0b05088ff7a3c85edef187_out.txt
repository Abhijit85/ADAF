=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: On the course the horse Conduit raced at with 6/4 odds, is it raining?

**Factual Answer**: The structured data indicates that the race with 6/4 odds was the "Digibet Maiden Stakes" at Kempton. However, the data does not provide information about the weather conditions during the race. The visual analysis of Kempton Park shows a clear sky with some clouds, suggesting it was not raining at the time the image was captured. Without specific weather data for the date of the race, it is not possible to definitively confirm the weather conditions during the race.

**Source**: Combined analysis from structured data and visual information.

**Confidence**: Medium
