=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: When looking at a list of original owners of the GE C30-7, which railroad possesses fewer of these locomotives: the railroad whose logo is in the shape of a shield, or the railroad that was chartered in February of 1859 and which serves the Santa Fe Railway Depot in Galesburg, Illinois?

**Factual Answer**: The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF), which was chartered in February 1859 and is associated with the Santa Fe Railway Depot in Galesburg, Illinois, originally owned fewer GE C30-7 locomotives compared to the Union Pacific Railroad, which has a shield-shaped logo.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text and structured data.

**Confidence**: High

Answer Echoes:
- The Union Pacific Railroad is known for its shield-shaped logo.
- The Burlington Northern Railroad (BN) was chartered in February 1859. It is known to serve the Santa Fe Railway Depot in Galesburg, Illinois.
- Union Pacific Railroad is known for its shield-shaped logo.
- Burlington Northern Railroad was chartered in February 1859 and serves the Santa Fe Railway Depot in Galesburg, Illinois.
