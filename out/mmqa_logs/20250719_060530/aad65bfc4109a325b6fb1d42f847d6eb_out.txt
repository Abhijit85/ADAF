=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Do they still make "King of the Hill"?

**Factual Answer**: As of my last update in October 2023, "King of the Hill" was not actively being produced as a new series. The original animated sitcom aired from 1997 to 2010. However, there have been discussions and announcements about a potential revival by its creators, Mike Judge and Greg Daniels, through a new animation company called Bandera Entertainment. To confirm whether new episodes are currently being produced or aired, one would need to consult the latest entertainment news or official announcements.

**Source**: Text analysis and general knowledge up to October 2023.

**Confidence**: Medium, due to the lack of current structured data and the need for up-to-date information from entertainment news sources.
