=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Non-Stop Production produced which film most recently: The production with a poster featuring a shirtless woman or The Inhabited Island Part II?

**Factual Answer**: Based on the available data, "The Inhabited Island Part II" was released in 2009. Without specific information about the posters of the films produced by Non-Stop Production, it is not possible to determine which film features a shirtless woman on its poster. Therefore, we cannot conclusively identify if there is a more recent film with such a poster feature than "The Inhabited Island Part II."
