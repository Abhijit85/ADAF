=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: The player with a beard from the PFA Team of the Year championship in the 2000s came from which club?

**Factual Answer**: The specific characteristic of having a beard is not directly extractable from the structured data provided about the PFA Team of the Year Championship in the 2000s. Therefore, it is not possible to determine from which club the bearded player came based solely on the data. Additional context, such as visual records or descriptions from external sources, would be required to identify the player with a beard.

**Source**: Structured data analysis

**Confidence**: Medium (due to the lack of specific information about the player's appearance in the data)

Answer Echoes:
(none)
