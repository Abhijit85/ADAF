=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Among the TV dramas that Sire Ma took part in, which show aired more recently: "Relic of an Emissary" or the show whose poster has shades of purple and pink?

**Factual Answer**: "Relic of an Emissary" aired in 2011. The most recent show listed in the data is "No Reserve," which was in post-production in 2016. However, without specific information about the poster colors, we cannot definitively identify which show has a purple and pink poster. Based on the available data, "No Reserve" aired more recently than "Relic of an Emissary."

**Source**: Structured data from the table listing TV dramas and their airing years.

**Confidence**: Medium, due to the lack of specific information about the poster colors.

Answer Echoes:
- "Relic of an Emissary" is a TV drama listed in the data.
- The show with a poster having shades of purple and pink is not explicitly named in the data. However, we need to identify the most recent show from the list.
- "Relic of an Emissary" aired in 2011.
- The most recent show in the data is "No Reserve," which is listed as being in post-production in 2016.
- The data does not provide explicit information about the color of the posters. Therefore, we cannot determine which show has a purple and pink poster based solely on the provided data.
