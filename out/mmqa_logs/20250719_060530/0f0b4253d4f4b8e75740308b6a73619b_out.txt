=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In the television show that features a house on its title screen and Anna Akana as an actress, what is Jude's boyfriend's name?

**Factual Answer**: The question seems to be based on a misunderstanding or incorrect association of shows. In the television show "The Fosters," which features a house on its title screen, Jude Adams Foster's boyfriends are Connor and later Noah. However, Anna Akana is not part of "The Fosters." Anna Akana is known for her role in "Youth & Consequences," but this show does not feature a character named Jude. Therefore, there is no show that fits the description provided with both a character named Jude and Anna Akana as an actress.
