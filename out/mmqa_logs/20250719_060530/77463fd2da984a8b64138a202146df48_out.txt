=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Is there heat transfer in an isothermal process?

**Factual Answer**: Yes, there is heat transfer in an isothermal process. In thermodynamics, an isothermal process is characterized by a constant temperature (ΔT = 0). For an ideal gas undergoing such a process, the change in internal energy (ΔU) is zero because internal energy is a function of temperature. However, to maintain this constant temperature while allowing work to be done by or on the system, heat must be transferred into or out of the system. This heat transfer is essential to compensate for the work done, ensuring the temperature remains constant throughout the process.
