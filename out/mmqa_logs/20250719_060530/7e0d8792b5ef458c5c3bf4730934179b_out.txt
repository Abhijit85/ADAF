=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was the outcome of the post-1918 battle involving Czechia which was also the war fought the last the navy made the coast guard a part of it?

**Factual Answer**: The last war where the United States Coast Guard operated as part of the Navy was World War II (1939-1945). However, this war did not involve Czechia (Czechoslovakia) in the context of the Coast Guard's operations. Post-1918, Czechoslovakia was involved in the Gulf War (1990-1991), but there is no evidence that the Coast Guard operated under the Navy during this conflict. Therefore, the specific battle or war involving Czechia where the Coast Guard was part of the Navy does not align with the historical records available.

**Source**: Textual analysis and historical data on military operations.

**Confidence**: High
