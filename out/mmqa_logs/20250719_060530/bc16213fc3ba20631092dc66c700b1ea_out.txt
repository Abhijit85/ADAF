=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: When did Kings Park Stadium host a tour advertised with a poster showing a woman with her hands in the air?

**Factual Answer**: The available data and visual analysis do not provide information about a tour at Kings Park Stadium with a poster showing a woman with her hands in the air. The visual analysis identified a poster for Gloria Estefan's "Evolution tour '97" at Aloha Stadium, not Kings Park Stadium. Therefore, there is no evidence from the provided sources to determine when such an event occurred at Kings Park Stadium.

**Source**: Combined analysis of structured data and visual information.

**Confidence**: Medium, due to the lack of specific information about Kings Park Stadium in the provided sources.
