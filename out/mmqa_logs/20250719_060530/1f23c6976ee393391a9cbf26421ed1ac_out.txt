=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Which player who was a point scorer in the 2009 Six Nations Championship has lower Pld: The African American player or Lionel Beauxis?

**Factual Answer**: Lionel Beauxis played 2 matches in the 2009 Six Nations Championship. The data provided does not specify any player as African American, and therefore, a direct comparison cannot be made based on the information available. Without additional context or identification of an African American player in the data, it is not possible to determine if there is a player with fewer matches played than Lionel Beauxis.

**Source**: Structured data from the table of point scorers in the 2009 Six Nations Championship.

**Confidence**: Medium (due to the lack of specific identification of an African American player in the data).
