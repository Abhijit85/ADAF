=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Expedition 12, in 2005, was the 12th expedition to the International Space Station (ISS), a space station, or a habitable artificial satellite, in low Earth orbit, its first component launched into orbit, in what year?

**Factual Answer**: The first component of the International Space Station (ISS), known as Zarya, was launched into orbit in 1998.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context and structured data.

**Confidence**: High

Answer Echoes:
- **Temporal Question**: The question seeks to identify the year of a specific event (the launch of the first component of the ISS).
- **Temporal Information**: Focus on extracting the year of the launch of the first component of the ISS.
- **Find Dates**: The first component of the ISS, known as Zarya (or the Functional Cargo Block), was launched into orbit.
- **Identify Events**: The launch of Zarya marked the beginning of the ISS assembly in space.
- **Factual Accuracy**: Ensure the year is correct and consistent with historical records.
- **Question Type**: Temporal
- **Information Needs**: Year of the first component launch of the ISS
- **Data Sources**: Text context provided
- **Reasoning Path**: Extract temporal information from the text context
- **Temporal Information**: The text explicitly states that the first component of the ISS was launched into orbit in 1998.
- **Supporting Facts**: The structured data analysis confirms that the first component of the ISS, known as Zarya, was launched in 1998.
- **Text Primary**: The text context provides the primary information.
- **Data Support**: Structured data confirms the text information.
- **Consistency Check**: Both sources align, confirming the year 1998.
- **Complete Picture**: The combined information provides a clear answer.
