=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Which player with top assists in the FA Premier League of 1999-2000 has a higher rank: The player with a bald head or the best player that ever played in the Premier League?

**Factual Answer**: To accurately answer this question, we need specific data on player assists from the 1999-2000 FA Premier League season, as well as clear identification of the players described. The description "the player with a bald head" is too vague without additional context, and "the best player that ever played in the Premier League" is subjective and could refer to several players, such as Ryan Giggs, who is often celebrated for his achievements. However, without the specific assist data and clear identification of the players, it is not possible to determine which player had a higher rank in terms of assists for that season.

**Source**: Text analysis and general knowledge

**Confidence**: Low, due to the lack of specific structured data and clear identification of the players based on the descriptions provided.

Answer Echoes:
- A list of players with their assist counts for that season.
- Identification of players fitting the descriptions ("bald head" and "best player that ever played in the Premier League").
- **Ryan Giggs** is mentioned as having been voted the Best Player and is a prominent figure in the Premier League, having won numerous championship medals.
- The description "the best player that ever played in the Premier League" could potentially refer to Ryan Giggs, given his accolades and recognition in the text.
- There is no structured data provided regarding player assists for the 1999-2000 season.
- The description "the player with a bald head" is ambiguous without additional context or data to identify a specific player.
- **Low**: Due to the lack of structured data and specific identification of the players based on the descriptions provided.
- Specific data on player assists from the 1999-2000 FA Premier League season.
- Identification of players fitting the descriptions ("bald head" and "best player that ever played in the Premier League").
