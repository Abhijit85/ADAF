**Factual Answer**: In the Middle Ages, manors were typically owned by lords or nobles as part of the feudal system.

The ownership could also extend to religious figures such as bishops and abbots, who held manors as part of their ecclesiastical duties. The manorial system was a fundamental aspect of feudalism, where the lord of the manor had control over the land and its inhabitants, including peasants and serfs.
