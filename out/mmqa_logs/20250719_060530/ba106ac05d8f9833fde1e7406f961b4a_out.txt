=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Of the movies that the English actress Sheila Allen appeared in, which has a spider web on its poster?

**Factual Answer**: Sheila Allen appeared in the movie "The Wicker Man" (1973). However, the poster for "The Wicker Man" does not feature a spider web. The confusion might arise from the thematic elements of the film, which involve pagan rituals and symbolism, but a spider web is not a prominent feature of its poster. It seems there might be a mix-up with another film or a misinterpretation of the poster's imagery.

**Source**: General knowledge about movie posters and Sheila Allen's filmography.

**Confidence**: Medium, due to the lack of direct visual evidence of a spider web on the poster of "The Wicker Man" and the absence of structured data to confirm the presence of a spider web on any other film poster featuring Sheila Allen.
