=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: How many triangles are present on this flag the Scottish people use?

**Factual Answer**: The flag of Scotland, known as the Saltire or St. Andrew's Cross, contains four triangles. This design features a white diagonal cross on a blue field, which inherently forms four distinct triangular sections.

**Source**: Combined analysis from visual and text data.

**Confidence**: High
