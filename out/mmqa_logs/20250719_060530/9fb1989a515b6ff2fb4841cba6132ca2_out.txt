=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: When the total was 14.700 in 2014 Russian Cup All-Around, what is covering the gymnast's forehead?

**Factual Answer**: The structured data indicates that Viktoria Komova is the gymnast with a total score of 14.700 in the 2014 Russian Cup All-Around. However, the data does not provide any information about what is covering her forehead. The visual analysis does not directly identify Viktoria Komova or provide specific details about her appearance during the event. Therefore, without additional visual or descriptive information from the event, it is not possible to accurately determine what, if anything, was covering her forehead.

**Source**: Combined analysis of structured data and visual information.

**Confidence**: Medium, due to the lack of specific visual or descriptive information about the gymnast's appearance.
