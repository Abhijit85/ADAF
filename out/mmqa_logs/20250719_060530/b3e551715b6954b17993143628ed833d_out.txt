=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In the families of 2012 spaceflight, which family has wide red stripes on the rocket body?

**Factual Answer**: The PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle) family, operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), is known for having rockets with wide red stripes on the body. This design feature is prominent in the PSLV rockets, which are used for launching satellites into polar orbits. The presence of the Indian flag and the word "INDIA" on the rocket further confirms its origin and design characteristics.
