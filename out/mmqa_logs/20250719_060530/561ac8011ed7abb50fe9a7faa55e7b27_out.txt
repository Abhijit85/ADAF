=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What was Cole Sprouse's role on television when the logo of the title has people playing instruments?

**Factual Answer**: Cole Sprouse did not have a role in the television show "I'm in the Band." The confusion may arise from a crossover episode titled "Weasels on Deck," where characters from "The Suite Life on Deck," including Cole Sprouse's character Cody Martin, appeared on "I'm in the Band." However, Cole Sprouse's primary role was as Cody Martin in "The Suite Life on Deck," not in "I'm in the Band."
