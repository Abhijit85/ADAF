=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What is the name of the Comarca within Zaragoza Province that has a hexagon-shaped fountain, with a turquoise-colored lining, in its capital city's square?

**Factual Answer**: Based on the available information, the specific Comarca within Zaragoza Province that features a hexagon-shaped fountain with a turquoise-colored lining in its capital city's square is not identified. The structured data does not provide details about such specific landmarks, and the visual analysis describes a fountain with an octagonal shape and classical statues, which does not match the description of a hexagon-shaped fountain with a turquoise lining. Additional context from local guides or government resources would be necessary to accurately identify the Comarca with this specific feature.

**Source**: Combined analysis of structured data and visual information.

**Confidence**: Medium. The visual analysis provides some insights, but the specific feature described in the question is not confirmed by the available data or images.
