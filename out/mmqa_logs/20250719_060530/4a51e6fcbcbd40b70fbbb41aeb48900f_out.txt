=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: How many townships are in the state of Ohio?

**Factual Answer**: Ohio has approximately 1309 townships. This number is based on the 2010-2011 Ohio Municipal, Township and School Board Roster, which lists 1309 townships. There is a slight discrepancy with some structured data sources that list 1308 townships, which may be due to different counting methods or updates in records.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text context and structured data.

**Confidence**: Medium, due to the minor discrepancy between sources. Verification from the most recent state government records or geographic databases would provide the most accurate count.
