=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What state has the highest population of bears?

**Factual Answer**: Alaska has the highest population of bears in the United States. This is primarily due to its large populations of both brown bears (grizzlies) and black bears. Alaska's vast wilderness and suitable habitats support these large bear populations, making it the state with the most bears.

**Source**: Combined analysis from general wildlife population data, reports from wildlife conservation organizations, and text context indicating the significant presence of grizzly bears in Alaska.

**Confidence**: High
