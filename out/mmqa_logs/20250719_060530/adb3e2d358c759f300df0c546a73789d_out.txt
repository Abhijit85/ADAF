=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: How does a plane wing create lift and which physics concept applies?

**Factual Answer**: A plane wing creates lift through the application of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion. Bernoulli's principle explains that the shape of the wing (airfoil) causes air to move faster over the top surface than the bottom surface, resulting in lower pressure above the wing and higher pressure below it. This pressure difference generates lift. Additionally, according to Newton's third law, as the wing pushes air downward, the air pushes the wing upward with an equal and opposite force, further contributing to lift.
