=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: For the list of Castilian consorts of the House of Ivrea, what deaths are associated with the spouse who is riding a horse?

**Factual Answer**: The structured data provided does not include explicit information about a spouse riding a horse. The visual analysis suggests a medieval scene with a king and knights, but without a specific identification of a spouse riding a horse, it is not possible to determine the deaths associated with such a spouse from the given data. Additional context or a description of the image depicting a spouse riding a horse is required to answer the question accurately.

**Source**: Combined analysis of structured data and visual elements.

**Confidence**: Medium, due to the lack of specific identification of a spouse riding a horse in the available data.
