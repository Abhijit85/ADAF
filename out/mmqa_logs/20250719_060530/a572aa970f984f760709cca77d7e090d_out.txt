=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What facial expression does David Baldacci have?

**Factual Answer**: The question about David Baldacci's facial expression cannot be definitively answered without visual evidence such as a photograph or video. Facial expressions are subjective and can vary depending on the context, mood, and situation. If a specific image or event is referenced, a description of the expression in that context could be provided. However, without such visual or contextual information, it is not possible to accurately describe his facial expression.

**Source**: Visual and contextual information required

**Confidence**: Low, due to the lack of specific visual or contextual data.
