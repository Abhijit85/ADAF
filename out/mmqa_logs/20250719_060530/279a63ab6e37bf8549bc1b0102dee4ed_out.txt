=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Who was responsible for the heliocentric theory that stated the Earth revolved around the Sun?

**Factual Answer**: Nicolaus Copernicus was responsible for the heliocentric theory, which proposed that the Earth and other planets revolve around the Sun. This model was a significant shift from the previously accepted geocentric model, which placed the Earth at the center of the universe. Copernicus presented this revolutionary idea in the 16th century, marking a pivotal moment in the history of astronomy.

**Source**: Combined analysis from historical records and scientific literature.

**Confidence**: High

Answer Echoes:
- **Question Type**: Factual
- **Information Needs**: Identify the individual responsible for the heliocentric theory.
- **Data Sources**: Text context and structured data on historical scientific theories.
- **Reasoning Path**: Combine historical context from the text with structured data to confirm the origin of the heliocentric theory.
- **Temporal Information**: The heliocentric model was presented in the 16th century by Nicolaus Copernicus.
- **Factual Definitions**: The heliocentric model places the Sun at the center of the Solar System, with Earth and other planets revolving around it.
- **Supporting Facts**: The heliocentric theory is a significant scientific concept that replaced the earlier geocentric model.
- **Additional Details**: Nicolaus Copernicus is recognized as the proposer of this model.
- **Text Primary**: The text provides the historical context and identifies Copernicus as the proposer.
- **Data Support**: Structured data confirms Copernicus's role and the significance of the heliocentric model.
- **Consistency Check**: Both sources consistently attribute the heliocentric theory to Copernicus.
- **Complete Picture**: Copernicus's model initiated a major scientific revolution.
