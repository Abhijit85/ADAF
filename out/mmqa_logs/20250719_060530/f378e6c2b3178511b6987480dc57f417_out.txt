=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: How many games does the player with short red hair have listed in the games played of Major League Soccer?

**Factual Answer**: The available data does not provide information about the hair color of the players, and therefore, it is not possible to determine how many games the player with short red hair has played based solely on the structured data provided. Additional information, such as player profiles or photographs, would be needed to identify the player by hair color and then determine the number of games they have played.

**Source**: Structured data table listing MLS players and their games played.

**Confidence**: Low, due to the lack of specific information about player appearance in the data provided.
