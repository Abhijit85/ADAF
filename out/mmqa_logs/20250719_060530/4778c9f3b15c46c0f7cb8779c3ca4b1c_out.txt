=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In the 2012 Toronto FC season, which player/manager is higher in the MLS Team of the Week: Miloš Kocić or the African American player/manager?

**Factual Answer**: Based on the available data, Miloš Kocić was named in Week 19 of the MLS Team of the Week. There is no explicit mention or identification of an African American player or manager in the data provided for the 2012 Toronto FC season. Therefore, it is not possible to make a direct comparison between Miloš Kocić and an African American player/manager for their positions in the MLS Team of the Week.

**Source**: Structured data from the MLS Team of the Week selections for the 2012 Toronto FC season.

**Confidence**: Medium, due to the lack of explicit identification of an African American player/manager in the data.

Answer Echoes:
- Miloš Kocić, a goalkeeper, was named in Week 19.
- The term "African American" is not explicitly mentioned in the data, so we need to identify the player or manager who might fit this description. Based on the names and linked Wikipedia pages, none of the individuals explicitly match the description of being African American.
