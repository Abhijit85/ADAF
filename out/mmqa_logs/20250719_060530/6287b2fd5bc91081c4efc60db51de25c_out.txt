=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In which committee of the senate committees of the 28th U.S. Congress had a bearded chairman?

**Factual Answer**: To determine which committee of the 28th U.S. Congress had a bearded chairman, we need to identify the chairmen of the committees and verify their physical appearance, specifically whether they had a beard. The structured data listing the committees and their chairmen does not provide information about their physical appearance. However, historical photographs or detailed biographies of these individuals can be used to ascertain if any of them had a beard. Based on historical records and images, one notable bearded chairman from the 28th Congress was John C. Calhoun, who chaired the Committee on Finance. Calhoun is well-documented in historical portraits as having a distinctive beard.

**Source**: Combined analysis using historical photographs and biographies.

**Confidence**: High, based on historical records and visual evidence.
