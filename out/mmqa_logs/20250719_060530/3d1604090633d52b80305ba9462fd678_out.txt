=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: When was the team from the state with a logo featuring two intersecting triangles in the Baseball Challenge League founded?

**Factual Answer**: The question requires identifying a team in the Baseball Challenge League with a logo featuring two intersecting triangles. Based on the visual analysis, the logo described resembles a mountain or peak, which could be associated with a team from Colorado, known for its mountainous geography. The Colorado Rockies, a Major League Baseball team, have a logo that includes mountain imagery, but they are not part of the Baseball Challenge League. Without specific data on the Baseball Challenge League teams and their logos, it is not possible to provide a definitive founding year for the team in question. Additional information about the specific teams and their logos in the Baseball Challenge League is needed to accurately answer the question.

**Source**: Visual analysis and general knowledge

**Confidence**: Low, due to lack of specific information about the Baseball Challenge League teams and their logos.
