=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: The primary colors of pigment are cyan, yellow, and magenta. True or false?

**Factual Answer**: True. The primary colors of pigment in the subtractive color model are cyan, yellow, and magenta. This model is widely used in color printing and mixing paints. Historically, the RYB (Red, Yellow, Blue) model was used in art and art education, but modern scientific color theory recognizes cyan, yellow, and magenta as the primary colors for pigments.
