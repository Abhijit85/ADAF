=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: The qual 2 1:31.038 2007 Lexmark Indy 300 qualifier holds what in the air?

**Factual Answer**: The phrase "holds what in the air" in the context of the 2007 Lexmark Indy 300 qualifier, specifically referring to Simon Pagenaud's qualifying time of 1:31.038, does not have a direct factual answer based on the structured data or visual analysis. The expression seems metaphorical or idiomatic, possibly referring to a celebratory gesture or acknowledgment, such as raising a hand or trophy, which is common in racing events. However, without additional context or clarification, the exact meaning remains ambiguous.

**Source**: Combined analysis of structured data and visual context.

**Confidence**: Medium (due to the ambiguity of the phrase and lack of direct data correlation).
