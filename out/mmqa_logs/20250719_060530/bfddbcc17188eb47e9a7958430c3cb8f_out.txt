=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: There are horned animals on which of the earthly branches of the zodiac of thirteen Buddhas?

**Factual Answer**: The question appears to conflate different cultural systems. The "earthly branches" are part of the Chinese zodiac, which traditionally consists of twelve animals. Among these, the Ox and the Goat are horned animals. The "thirteen Buddhas" is a concept from Japanese Buddhism, specifically related to the Shingon sect, and does not directly correlate with the Chinese zodiac or the concept of earthly branches. Therefore, in the context of the Chinese zodiac's earthly branches, the horned animals are the Ox and the Goat.

**Source**: Traditional Chinese zodiac information.

**Confidence**: Medium (due to the conflation of different cultural concepts in the question).
