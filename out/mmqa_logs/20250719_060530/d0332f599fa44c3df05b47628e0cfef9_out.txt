=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: The builder with red paint job in fleet of DASH bus was what year?

**Factual Answer**: Based on the visual analysis, the bus with a red paint job is identified as having the number 405 and the word "KING" on it. However, the structured data provided does not specify the year associated with this particular bus or its builder. Without additional data specifying the year of manufacture or acquisition for bus number 405, it is not possible to determine the year associated with the builder of the red-painted bus in the DASH fleet.
