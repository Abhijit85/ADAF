=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Which Player(s), in Scoring leaders of 2000–01 AHL season, Plays for the team with a pouncing wild cat on the jersey?

**Factual Answer**: The team with a pouncing wild cat on the jersey is the Louisville Panthers, the AHL affiliate of the Florida Panthers during the 2000–01 season. To identify the players from the Louisville Panthers who were among the scoring leaders in the 2000–01 AHL season, we would need specific data on the scoring leaders from that season. However, based on the team affiliation, any Louisville Panthers player listed among the scoring leaders would fit the description.

**Source**: Combined analysis of team affiliations and visual identification of team logos.

**Confidence**: Medium (due to the lack of specific scoring leader data from the 2000–01 AHL season).
