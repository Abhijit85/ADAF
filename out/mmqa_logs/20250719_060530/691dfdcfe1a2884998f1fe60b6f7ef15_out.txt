=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Among the honorary degrees bestowed upon Chulabhorn, in what field was the degree given by the school whose logo has three flowers and an open book?

**Factual Answer**: Based on the visual analysis, the emblem with three flowers and an open book is likely associated with an educational institution, possibly a university. However, without specific information linking this emblem to a particular institution from the structured data, it is not possible to definitively identify the field of the honorary degree awarded to Chulabhorn by this institution. Additional information about the logos of the academies listed in the data is required to provide a precise answer.

**Source**: Combined (Visual + Data)

**Confidence**: Medium, due to the lack of direct correlation between the visual description and the structured data.
