=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Who wrote the earliest surviving description of the Indietracks band in the line-up during July 26-28 of 2013?

**Factual Answer**: The question seeks the earliest surviving description of a band from the Indietracks festival line-up in 2013. However, based on the available data and text analysis, there is no information provided about the historical descriptions or documentation dates for any of the bands that performed during this event. Therefore, it is not possible to determine who wrote the earliest surviving description of any band from the 2013 Indietracks line-up with the given information.

**Source**: Combined analysis of text and structured data.

**Confidence**: Low, due to the lack of historical context or documentation dates for the bands in the provided data.
