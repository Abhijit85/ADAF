=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What were the manufacturers of the cars driven by Bobby Hillin Jr. in the Daytona 500 with the same start as the year 1995?

**Factual Answer**: In 1995, Bobby Hillin Jr. did not qualify for the Daytona 500, as indicated by the "DNQ" (Did Not Qualify) status for that year. Therefore, there is no manufacturer associated with a starting position for Bobby Hillin Jr. in the 1995 Daytona 500.

**Source**: Structured data analysis of Daytona 500 entries.

**Confidence**: High

Answer Echoes:
- We need to find the entry where the starting position is 1995, which is not possible as starting positions are typically much lower numbers. However, we can interpret this as looking for the year 1995 in the data and checking the starting position for that year.
- In 1995, the starting position is listed as "DNQ" (Did Not Qualify), which means there is no starting position for that year.
- Since the year 1995 has "DNQ" for both start and finish, Bobby Hillin Jr. did not participate in the race that year, and thus there is no manufacturer associated with a starting position.
