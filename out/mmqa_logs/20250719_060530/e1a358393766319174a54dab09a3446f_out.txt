=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Which location that the Georgia Force played at in the 2012 regular season schedule has a lower week: New Orleans Arena or the location of the American Conference Basketball Tournament?

**Factual Answer**: The New Orleans Arena appears in Week 20 of the Georgia Force's 2012 regular season schedule. The location of the American Conference Basketball Tournament, which is the Amway Center in Orlando, Florida, does not have a specified week number in the Georgia Force's 2012 schedule. Therefore, a direct comparison of week numbers cannot be made.

**Source**: Combined analysis from structured data and text context.

**Confidence**: Medium, due to missing information about the week number for the Amway Center in the Georgia Force's 2012 schedule.

Answer Echoes:
- **Question Type**: Temporal, comparative
- **Information Needs**: Week number of the Georgia Force's 2012 regular season schedule for two locations
- **Data Sources**: Text context and structured data
- **Reasoning Path**: Determine which location has a lower week number
- The structured data indicates that the New Orleans Arena appears in Week 20 of the Georgia Force's 2012 regular season schedule.
- **Text Primary**: The text provides the location of the American Athletic Conference Tournament.
- **Data Support**: The structured data provides the week number for the New Orleans Arena.
- **Consistency Check**: The week number for the Amway Center in the Georgia Force's 2012 schedule is missing, preventing a direct comparison.
