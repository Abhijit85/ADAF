=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Where do penguins live, North Pole or South Pole?

**Factual Answer**: Penguins live at the South Pole, not the North Pole. They are native to the Southern Hemisphere, primarily found in Antarctica. While some species of penguins inhabit temperate regions, such as the Galápagos penguin near the equator, they do not naturally live in the Arctic region, which is where the North Pole is located.

**Source**: Combined analysis from text and structured data.

**Confidence**: High

Answer Echoes:
- **Question Type**: Geographic, factual
- **Information Needs**: Determine the geographic location where penguins live, specifically whether they inhabit the North Pole or the South Pole.
- **Data Sources**: Text context and structured data
- **Reasoning Path**: Combine geographic information from the text with structured data to provide a complete answer.
- **Geographic Details**: Penguins are native to the Southern Hemisphere and are not limited to cold climates. They are found in Antarctica (South Pole) and other temperate regions, with the Galápagos penguin living near the equator due to the Humboldt Current.
- **Supporting Facts**: Penguins are primarily found in the Southern Hemisphere, specifically at the South Pole (Antarctica). They do not naturally inhabit the Arctic region (North Pole).
- **Text Primary**: The text confirms that penguins are native to the Southern Hemisphere and are found in Antarctica.
- **Data Support**: Structured data supports that penguins do not inhabit the North Pole.
- **Consistency Check**: Information from both sources aligns, confirming penguins' habitats.
- **Complete Picture**: Penguins live at the South Pole, not the North Pole.
