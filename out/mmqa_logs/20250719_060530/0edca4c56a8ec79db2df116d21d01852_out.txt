=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Which film did Akkineni Nagarjuna win a Nandi Award for most recently: The film that has a poster with a man holding an umbrella on it or Annamayya?

**Factual Answer**: Akkineni Nagarjuna most recently won a Nandi Award for the film "Rajanna" in 2011. However, the question requires identifying whether the film with a poster featuring a man holding an umbrella is the one for which he won the award. Based on the visual analysis, the film poster with a man holding an umbrella is not identified in the data provided. Therefore, without additional information about the film posters, we cannot definitively determine if the film with the umbrella poster is the one for which Nagarjuna won the award. However, based on the structured data alone, "Rajanna" is the most recent film for which he won a Nandi Award.
