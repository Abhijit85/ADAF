=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: In the league that has an eagle on the logo for the MLB team associated with the Dayton Dragons, does the pitcher take a turn at bat?

However, the Dayton Dragons are affiliated with the Cincinnati Reds, a National League team, where traditionally the pitcher does bat. Therefore, in the American League, the pitcher does not bat, but in the National League, which the Dayton Dragons are associated with, the pitcher traditionally does bat.
