**Question**: When is Season 9 of "Charmed" coming out?

**Factual Answer**: There is no Season 9 of the "Charmed" TV series. The original "Charmed" series concluded with Season 8 in 2006. A continuation of the series exists in the form of a comic book series titled "Charmed: Season 9," which was published between June 2010 and October 2012. As of my last update in October 2023, there has been no official announcement regarding a new TV season for "Charmed."
