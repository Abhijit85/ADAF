=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Are there great white sharks in the Atlantic Ocean?

**Factual Answer**: Yes, great white sharks are present in the Atlantic Ocean. They inhabit both the western and eastern parts of the Atlantic, including areas off the coasts of the United States, Canada, Europe, and Africa. Studies indicate that they prefer certain oceanographic features, such as anticyclonic eddies, particularly in the North Atlantic Ocean.

**Source**: Combined analysis from marine biology studies and structured data on shark distribution.

**Confidence**: High

Answer Echoes:
- **Question Type**: Factual, geographic
- **Information Needs**: Presence of great white sharks in the Atlantic Ocean
- **Data Sources**: Text context, structured data on shark distribution
- **Reasoning Path**: Combine text context with structured data to confirm the presence of great white sharks in the Atlantic Ocean
- **Geographic Details**: The text mentions that white sharks prefer anticyclonic eddies in the North Atlantic Ocean.
- **Factual Definitions**: The study indicates a preference for warm water eddies, suggesting habitat presence.
- **Supporting Facts**: Great white sharks are found in both the western and eastern parts of the Atlantic Ocean, including areas off the coasts of the United States, Canada, Europe, and Africa.
- **Additional Details**: The structured data confirms the widespread distribution of great white sharks in the Atlantic Ocean.
- **Text Primary**: The study indicates a specific behavior of white sharks in the North Atlantic.
- **Data Support**: Structured data confirms their presence across the Atlantic Ocean.
- **Consistency Check**: Information from both sources aligns and supports the conclusion.
- **Complete Picture**: The combined information provides a comprehensive answer.
