**Question**: Thora Birch played what role in TV show with computer on poster?

**Factual Answer**: Thora Birch did not play a role in a TV show with a computer on the poster. The confusion might arise from the mention of "My Life as a Teenage Robot," which is an animated series about a robot and could potentially have a technology-themed poster. However, Thora Birch was not part of this show. She is not credited with any role in a TV show that prominently features a computer on its poster.
