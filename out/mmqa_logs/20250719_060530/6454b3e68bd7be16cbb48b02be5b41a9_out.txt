=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: What are powers not given by the constitution to the employers in the economy of Olympia, Washington that has an eagle on their logo?

**Factual Answer**: The question involves understanding the powers not granted to employers by a constitution, specifically in Olympia, Washington, and those with an eagle on their logo. Generally, constitutions, including the U.S. Constitution and state constitutions, do not directly grant powers to employers. Instead, they set the framework for what governments can do, leaving regulatory and legal constraints to be defined by laws and regulations. Employers in Olympia, Washington, like elsewhere, are subject to state and federal regulations, which include labor laws, environmental regulations, and other statutory limitations. These regulations define what employers can and cannot do, rather than the constitution itself. Without specific information about a local constitution or specific employers with an eagle on their logo, this remains a general understanding based on typical constitutional and legal frameworks.

**Source**: Text analysis and general knowledge of constitutional law.

**Confidence**: Medium, due to the lack of specific data on Olympia, Washington, and the employers with an eagle on their logo.
