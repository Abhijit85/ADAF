=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Question**: Is Chicago the biggest city in the world?

**Factual Answer**: Chicago is not the biggest city in the world. It is the third most populous city in the United States, with over 2.7 million residents and a metropolitan area population of nearly 10 million. However, cities like Tokyo, Delhi, and Shanghai have significantly larger populations. In terms of land area, cities such as New York City and Los Angeles also surpass Chicago. Therefore, while Chicago is a major city in the U.S., it is not the largest globally in terms of population or land area.
