=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The analysis synthesizes responses from cross-modal agents to determine the most accurate answer to a given question, using a structured decision-making process.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses provided the same answer with clear and robust reasoning, indicating a consensus. This consistency suggests a high level of reliability in the information presented by these responses.

2. **Fallback Rule:** In the absence of a consensus, one response offered a concrete answer supported by detailed evidence. This response was considered due to its comprehensive nature, even though the other responses indicated insufficient information.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** When all three responses differed, the decision was based on the quality of reasoning. The response with the clearest, most coherent, and in-depth explanation was selected, ensuring that the final answer was well-supported.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was chosen based on the strongest supporting rationale, ensuring transparency and logical consistency. This approach directly addressed the original question by prioritizing clarity and depth of explanation.
