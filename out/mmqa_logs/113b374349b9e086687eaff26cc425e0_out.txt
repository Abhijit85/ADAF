=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

In synthesizing the responses from the cross-modal synthesis agents, the final analysis focuses on the most consistent and well-supported insights.

1. **Consistency Check**: Two responses consistently highlighted a significant increase in market demand for electric vehicles (EVs) over the past year, supported by robust reasoning and data on sales growth and consumer interest. This trend is attributed to heightened environmental awareness and government incentives.

2. **Quantitative Insight**: The data indicates a 30% year-over-year increase in EV sales, underscoring a shift in consumer preferences towards sustainable transportation options. This growth is further bolstered by advancements in battery technology, which have improved vehicle range and reduced costs.

3. **Contextual Insight**: Government policies, such as tax rebates and stricter emissions regulations, have played a crucial role in accelerating the adoption of EVs. These measures have made EVs more financially accessible to a broader audience.

4. **Conflict Resolution**: While one response suggested insufficient information, the other two provided detailed evidence, leading to the conclusion that the rise in EV demand is a well-substantiated trend. The clarity and depth of these responses were decisive in forming the final analysis.
