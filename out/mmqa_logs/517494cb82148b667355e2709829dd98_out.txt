=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The analysis focuses on the specifications and requirements for small-bore rifles used in specific contexts, emphasizing weight, action type, and ammunition capacity.

1. **Weight Requirement:** Each rifle must weigh at least 3.5 kilograms, excluding ammunition and magazines, ensuring stability and compliance with regulations. This requirement is crucial for maintaining consistency and fairness in competitive settings.

2. **Action Type:** The rifles are specified to be either bolt action or Fortner (straight-pull bolt) action. This detail highlights the operational mechanism preferred for precision and reliability in shooting sports.

3. **Ammunition Capacity:** Each rifle is equipped with four magazines, each holding five rounds, allowing for a total of 20 rounds ready for use. This capacity is designed to balance the need for sufficient ammunition with the weight and handling constraints of the rifle.

4. **Additional Storage:** For relay races, additional rounds can be stored on the rifle stock, providing flexibility and ensuring competitors have enough ammunition for extended events without compromising the rifle's weight requirement.

**Final Synthesis:** The analysis is based on consistent information from multiple responses, emphasizing the importance of weight, action type, and ammunition capacity in the context of small-bore rifles. The decision to focus on these aspects is supported by clear and robust reasoning across the responses, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the requirements and their implications.

Answer Echoes:
- [DEFINITION] "Small-bore rifle" refers to rifles using .22 LR ammunition.
- [SCOPE] Rifles must weigh "at least 3.5 kilograms" excluding ammunition and magazines.
- [SOURCE] The context specifies rifles are "bolt action or Fortner (straight-pull bolt) action."
- [NOTE] Each rifle holds "4 magazines with 5 rounds each."
- [WARNING] Ensure rifles meet the "weight more than 3.5 kilograms" requirement.
- [NOTE] Additional rounds can be stored on the rifle stock for relay races.
