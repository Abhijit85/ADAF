=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The analysis synthesizes responses from cross-modal agents to determine the most accurate answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses agreed on a specific answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This consensus indicates a strong likelihood of accuracy, as the agreement is based on consistent evidence across different modalities.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response suggested insufficient information, but the concrete answer provided by the other two responses was detailed and well-supported, making it the more reliable choice.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Although there was a discrepancy with one response, the depth and coherence of the reasoning in the consistent responses outweighed the lack of information claim. The detailed evidence provided a comprehensive understanding of the issue.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer is selected based on the agreement of two responses, which offered a clear, logical, and well-supported rationale. This decision ensures transparency and addresses the original question effectively, demonstrating a robust synthesis of the available data.
