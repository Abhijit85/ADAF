=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The extinction of grizzly bears in California was a rapid process following the discovery of gold in 1848, with the last confirmed sightings occurring in the early 1920s.

1. **Timeline of Extinction**: Grizzly bears were declared extinct in California less than 75 years after the 1848 gold discovery, highlighting the rapid environmental impact of human activities during this period.
   
2. **Final Sightings and Hunting**: The last reported hunting of a grizzly bear occurred in Tulare County in August 1922, although no physical evidence was provided. The final sightings were in Sequoia National Park in 1924, marking the end of the species in the state.

3. **Human Impact**: The extinction timeline coincides with increased human settlement and resource extraction, suggesting that these activities significantly contributed to the grizzlies' disappearance.

4. **Historical Context**: Figures like "Grizzly Bill" Holcomb symbolize the era's attitudes towards wildlife, where hunting was prevalent and often unregulated, further accelerating the decline of grizzly populations.

This analysis is based on consistent information from multiple sources, emphasizing the rapid decline of grizzlies due to human expansion and exploitation.
