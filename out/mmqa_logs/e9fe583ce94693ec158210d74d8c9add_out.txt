=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

Grizzly bears, once widespread across North America, now face significant population challenges, particularly in the lower 48 US states.

1. **Population Distribution**: Approximately 55000 grizzly bears exist across North America, but only about 1500 remain in the lower 48 US states, primarily in Montana and Wyoming. This highlights a stark contrast in population density between regions.

2. **Historical Range**: Grizzlies currently inhabit about half of their historical range in North America, indicating a significant reduction in their natural habitat over time.

3. **Local Extinction**: The term "extirpated" is used to describe the local extinction of grizzlies in areas like the Great Plains and the southwestern US, underscoring the species' retreat from these regions.

4. **Conservation Implications**: The limited presence of grizzlies in the lower 48 states and their extirpation from large areas emphasize the need for targeted conservation efforts to prevent further decline and support population recovery.

This analysis is based on consistent data from multiple sources, highlighting the critical status of grizzly bears in specific regions.

Answer Echoes:
- [DEFINITION] "Extirpated" means locally extinct in certain areas but not globally.
- [SCOPE] Approximately 55,000 grizzly bears are found throughout North America.
- [SCOPE] Only about 1,500 grizzlies remain in the lower 48 US states.
- [SOURCE] Most grizzlies in the lower 48 are in Montana and Wyoming.
- [NOTE] Grizzlies inhabit about half of their historical range in North America.
- [WARNING] Grizzly bears have been extirpated from much of the Great Plains and southwestern US.
