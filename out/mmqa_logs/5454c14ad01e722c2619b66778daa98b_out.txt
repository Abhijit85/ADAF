=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The recall of the "Little Shop of Horrors" DVD was due to the inclusion of approximately 23 minutes of unfinished footage, which was not intended for public release.

1. **Scope of Recall:** The recall specifically involved 23 minutes of unfinished footage that was mistakenly included in the DVD release. This footage was in black and white and lacked some sound elements, indicating it was not ready for public viewing.

2. **Production Oversight:** David Geffen, a key figure associated with the film, was unaware of the DVD release until it reached stores, suggesting a significant oversight in the production or distribution process.

3. **Technical Limitations:** The original color print of the footage was destroyed in a studio fire, which left only a black-and-white version available. However, Geffen claimed to possess a color copy of the original ending, which could potentially rectify the issue if verified and utilized.

4. **Resolution Potential:** The existence of a color copy, as claimed by Geffen, presents an opportunity to restore the intended version of the film, potentially resolving the recall issue if the copy is authentic and complete.
