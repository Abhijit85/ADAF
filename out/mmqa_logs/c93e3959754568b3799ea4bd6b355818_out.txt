=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Final Answer:**

The 1996 NBA Draft was a pivotal event, particularly due to the selection and subsequent trade of Kobe Bryant. 

1. **Selection and Trade**: Kobe Bryant was initially selected by the Charlotte Hornets but was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers. This decision was influenced by the Hornets' coach, Dave Cowens, who believed the team "had no use for him."

2. **Jerry West's Influence**: Jerry West, a key figure in the Lakers' management, played a crucial role in the trade, as he "foresaw potential in Bryant's basketball ability," indicating his confidence in Bryant's future success.

3. **Hornets' Logo**: The Charlotte Hornets' logo, featuring a stylized hornet in teal, purple, and white, symbolizes the team that originally drafted Bryant, highlighting their role in this significant draft event.

4. **Contextual Limitations**: The analysis does not cover Bryant's career post-trade or delve deeply into the Hornets' rationale, focusing instead on the draft and trade dynamics.

**Explanation**: This synthesis was chosen because it consistently appeared in two responses, providing a clear and robust explanation of the draft's key elements, including the trade dynamics and influential figures involved.
