=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two of the responses provided the same answer, supported by clear and robust reasoning. This indicates a consensus among the agents, which aligns with Rule (A) for selecting the final answer.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response suggested insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. Therefore, it does not override the consensus reached by the other two responses.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** Since there was no significant conflict among the responses, as two were consistent, there was no need to weigh the quality of reasoning for conflict resolution.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer is based on the consistent responses, which were supported by clear reasoning. This decision was influenced by the alignment of two responses and the lack of a compelling alternative from the third response, ensuring a transparent and logically consistent conclusion.
