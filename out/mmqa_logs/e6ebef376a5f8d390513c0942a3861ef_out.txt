=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of the West Iberian Romance languages, specifically Portuguese and Spanish, reveals notable differences in phonology, grammar, and lexicon, despite some mutual intelligibility.

1. **Phonological Differences**: Portuguese and Spanish exhibit distinct phonetic characteristics. For instance, Portuguese has nasal vowels, which are absent in Spanish, and Spanish features a more pronounced use of the "th" sound, which is not present in Portuguese.

2. **Grammatical Variations**: The two languages differ in verb conjugation and usage. Portuguese often uses the future subjunctive tense, which is largely obsolete in Spanish. Additionally, the placement of object pronouns can vary, with Portuguese allowing for more flexibility.

3. **Lexical Divergence**: While both languages share a significant amount of vocabulary due to their Latin roots, there are numerous false cognates and unique terms in each language. For example, the word "pasta" means "folder" in Portuguese but "paste" in Spanish.

4. **Mutual Intelligibility**: Although there is some degree of mutual intelligibility, it is not complete. Speakers may understand basic concepts but struggle with complex or nuanced communication due to the differences outlined above.

This synthesis was chosen based on the consistency and depth of reasoning provided by the majority of responses, which highlighted these key linguistic distinctions.

Answer Echoes:
- [DEFINITION] "West Iberian Romance" includes Portuguese, Spanish, and other related languages or dialects.
- [SCOPE] Focuses on phonology, grammar, and lexicon differences between Portuguese and Spanish.
- [SOURCE] Information is derived from linguistic classification of Iberian languages.
- [NOTE] Mutual intelligibility exists among languages in the West Iberian Romance group.
- [WARNING] Do not assume complete mutual intelligibility; it varies among languages.
