=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

The analysis of the responses reveals a consensus on the most accurate answer, supported by robust reasoning.

1. **Consistency Check**: Two responses agree that the available data is insufficient to provide a definitive answer. They both highlight the lack of comprehensive evidence across modalities, emphasizing the need for more data to draw a reliable conclusion.

2. **Fallback Rule**: The third response offers a concrete answer, but its reasoning lacks depth and fails to address the gaps identified by the other two responses. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for selection under the fallback rule.

3. **Conflict Resolution**: Given the agreement between the first two responses and the insufficient rationale in the third, the decision aligns with the majority view that the information is inadequate for a conclusive answer.

4. **Final Synthesis**: The final decision is based on the consistency and clarity of the reasoning provided by the two responses that highlight the insufficiency of data. This approach ensures a transparent and logically consistent conclusion, adhering to the established rules.
