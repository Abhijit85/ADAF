=== FINAL SUMMARY ===

**Overview:** The task involves synthesizing responses from cross-modal synthesis agents to determine the most accurate final answer based on consistency, evidence, and reasoning quality.

1. **Consistency Check:** Two responses agreed on a specific answer, both providing clear and robust reasoning. This alignment suggests a high level of confidence in the accuracy of the information presented.

2. **Fallback Rule:** The third response indicated insufficient information but did not provide a concrete answer with detailed evidence. Therefore, it was not considered under the fallback rule, as the other two responses already provided a consistent and well-supported answer.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** There was no need for conflict resolution as the two consistent responses were already selected based on their clarity and depth of reasoning.

4. **Final Synthesis:** The final answer was chosen based on the agreement between two responses, which demonstrated strong supporting rationale. This decision was influenced by the clear, coherent, and detailed explanations provided, ensuring a logically consistent and transparent conclusion.
